Colt had discontinued this model in 1940. The Great Western revolver was sold by mail order in the 50s and early 60s, and was used in many Western movies and television shows. Colt’s model 1873 single action “Peacemaker” revolver was iconic by the early 20th century as the ‘gun that won the West’. Colt continued to produce it through the 1930’s though it was by then functionally antiquated compared to modern revolvers and pistols. Sales dwindled to almost nothing in the Depression, and when WWII broke out in Europe, Colt dropped the SAA to focus production resources on its military arms contracts.  After the war, film and television spurred renewed interest in the SAA but Colt was not immediately persuaded to resume production. In the Los Angeles area an enterprise to produce an SAA copy coalesced around Northrup engineer William R. Wilson, mail-order impresario Hy Hunter, and several firearm professionals from nearby Weatherby. This group started production of the Great Western Arms Frontier SAA revolver in 1954. The Great Western Arms enterprise operated for about ten years, but never overcame domestic and foreign competitors that also introduced western style revolvers. The business was beset by regular insolvencies, and was twice surrendered to vendors holding account receivables. Los Angeles Rams executive Dan Reeves and Rams team physician Dan Fortmann are understood to have been the company's first capital investors, and Wilson’s backer [2][3]. The last proprietor was EMF Co, which still operates today as a firearms retailer.  Over the 1954-64 period Great Western made about 22000 revolvers and 3300 derringers. Great Western's single action revolver was mostly identical to Colt's original version, save for a few modern improvements. It was notably identifiable for its stag pattern plastic grips. It was available in popular revolver calibers. Great Western's derringer was also a faithful reproduction, that of the Remington model 95. Wilson and Hunter courted spokesmen endorsers as they rolled out the Great Western Frontier revolver in 1954, and the gun became somewhat known for its association with 50’s Hollywood western film and TV production.  John Wayne appeared on the company’s catalogs through its entire run. He was presented with two sets of engraved revolvers, one of these sets he used later in the 1976 film \"The Shootist\". Audie Murphy and Mel Torme were other endorsers.  A specially made Great Western revolver was built for Don Knotts in the Disney movie, \"The Shakiest Gun in the West\"; this revolver would comically fall apart when cocking the hammer. In 1955 Wilson sent unsolicited to President Eisenhower an ornately engraved .38 revolver and a similar model to California Governor Goodwin J. Knight."], "neg": ["Patchen, California\nPatchen, California Patchen is a ghost town nestled in the Santa Cruz Mountains, in unincorporated west Santa Clara County, California. It is located along the Old Santa Cruz Highway, east of State Route 17. California became an American territory in 1846. The earliest known permanent white settler in what became Patchen was Charles Henry \"Mountain Charley\" McKiernan. In the 1850s and 1860s, McKiernan built roads throughout his property on the summit of the mountains and operated a toll road down an old Indian trail near the site. In 1850, McKiernan settled near the lagoon about one mile south. On May 8, 1854, McKiernan and John Taylor, a neighbor, were hunting with Taylor's dog. They both shot at a grizzly bear and McKiernan hit the bear but only dazed it. Not having time to reload his gun, McKiernan hit the bear over the head with his rifle until it broke. The enraged bear rose up and made a snap at Charley, catching him over the left eye and forehead, crushing his skull and tearing out a piece about five by three inches. Three San Jose doctors crafted a silver plate from two Mexican pesos and patched the hole in Charley's head without the benefit of anesthetics. Grizzly bears were reportedly hunted into extinction in California; the last reported sighting of a grizzly in the Santa Cruz Mountains was in November 1885 near Bonny Doon. McKiernan lived until January 16, 1892. Directly across the road from the town's site is California Historical Landmark marker #448 commemorating the town and the legend of \"Mountain Charley.\" This was the first settlement in the area and centered on the Post Office, called Patchen. The origins of the name Patchen may go back to ancient times in what is now Patching Parish in Sussex, England. People by the name Patching, Patchen, and Patchin have been listed in that area since the 800 A.D. In 1634, Joseph Patching came to the U.S. and most of the Patchens in America can be traced to him. The name reached the San Francisco Bay Area by way of a famous race horse named \"George M. Patchen\" and his son, \"Smith Patchen,\" nicknamed \"California Patchen,\" because of his good showing in California in 1862 and again in 1867 in San Jose, San Francisco, and Sacramento. The post office name appears on government records as having been established at Patchen on March 28, 1872. The post office operated until November 30, 1929. One of the first postmasters was D.C. Feely; in 1885, he represented Patchen at the American Exposition at New Orleans. Feely took a polished wood collection, a soil sample from his farm, and a large exhibit of fresh fruit provided by the local fruit growers. The Feely Ranch, located about a quarter mile north of Patchen, was a favored vacation spot of writer Jack London (1876- 1916). London wrote some of his works while vacationing at the ranch. The area is still identified on the official Santa Clara County Assessor's map as \"Call of the Wild\" (the name of Jack London's famous early novel) and there is a road by the same name north of Patchen. The Edgemont Hotel was located in Patchen and operated by Mr. and Mrs. L.N. Scott. It was located in the flat area near the road, about where the main parking lot for the Christmas tree farm is today. In 1855, the California Stage Company was awarded the United States mail contract from San Jose to Santa Cruz and Patchen became the place to change horses. One of the most famous drivers on the mountain route was Charley Parkhurst, who drove over the mountain roads about 1868. Like other stage drivers, Parkhurst wore a heavy muffler, gloves, a buffalo skin coat and cap. Also, like other drivers, Parkhurst had a sharp throaty whistle, used like a horn to warn others that the stage was just around the corner. For these reasons \"Charley\" was able to hide her identity until her death. The stage was held up at Patchen on the afternoon of April 1, 1874. After the second robbery in the same area on April 28, 1874 the culprits were captured and sent off to the state prison at San Quentin with the help of \"Mountain Charley\" and the local posse. From the 1880s to the early 1900s vacationers, going into the mountains to places such as the Edgemont Hotel in Patchen or to Santa Cruz, filled the roads with horses and wagons. A narrow gauge railroad opened in 1880 from Los Gatos, along the Los Gatos Creek, to Wright's Station about a mile east of Patchen. From Wright's Station it went through a two mile long tunnel to Laurel, then through other tunnels to Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz. The Southern Pacific bought the railroad around 1900. At 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, the most disastrous earthquake in California history shook the area. Roads were blocked by landslides, bridges were broken, houses and hotels were shaken to the ground, and the railroad was destroyed. Shifts in the nearby San Andreas Fault caused significant offsets and fissures, especially in Wrights. The railroad was rebuilt and continued to operate until early 1940, when severe storms blocked the route. Southern Pacific considered rebuilding the railroad again, then decided to abandon it. The same year State Route 17 was completed and bypassed Patchen, contributing to its decline. In 1949, one of the three buildings which remained from the original town of Patchen was torn down by Paul Von Ahnen, who used its hand-hewn timbers to build his house, across the road from the present Christmas tree farm. The building had been the old stage station, built in the 1870s. On December 29, 1957, fire destroyed the building which had been erected by Joseph Fowler in 1876 as the post office. Fowler had kept the office in his home for the four years prior to that time. The chimney of the old post office stood until 5:04 p.m. on October 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake brought it crashing to the ground after more than one hundred years. The barn, the last remaining building, was disassembled and reassembled on a new foundation in 1985 and is in the process of restoration by the current owner. The huge concrete reservoir located on the property was fed by springs and used as the water supply for the town. The land where the town once stood was purchased, piece by piece, during the late 1960s and early 1970s by the current owner and converted to a Christmas tree farm to preserve it from development. The Christmas tree farm on the site of Patchen is one of the few farms that produces Monterey pines. It also grows Sierra redwoods and the ever-popular Douglas firs. The farm preserves relics from Patchen's heyday, including the water supply reservoir, a historical landmark plaque, and remnants of a bar and hotel. Owner Jim Beck started buying little pieces of land in the 1960s. He told the \"Saratoga News\" that his \"original motivation was because there was a lot of explosive growth in the mountains and I didn't want to see all that development going on around me. I considered growing wine grapes or kiwis, but I decided on Christmas trees. This is like an overgrown hobby for me.\" A frequent danger in the Santa Cruz Mountains is forest fires. In the mid-1980s, a forest fire came so close to the farm that the trees were threatened. Beck rewarded the firefighters who put the fire out with free Christmas trees for life. Nearby the town's site is Patchen Pass, the highest point on Highway 17, with an elevation of above sea level. This pass is sometimes covered for hours or even days with snow. The pass is located at latitude 37°08'39\"N, longitude 121°59'05\"W; decimal degrees: latitude 37.14411, longitude -121.98468.", "The Great Dan Patch\nThe Great Dan Patch The Great Dan Patch is a 1949 American film directed by Joseph M. Newman about the trotting horse Dan Patch. The film is also known as Ride a Reckless Mile (American reissue title), and Dan Patch. In the last decade of the 19th century, chemist David Palmer returns to Oxford, Indiana, after living in Chicago for a few years. The return is brought on by his upcoming marriage to school teacher Ruth Treadwell. Upon his arrival, David receives a very warm welcome from his father, Dan, who makes a living breeding race horses. Dan is disappointed, however, when David tells him they are not to live as a married couple on the farm, but plans to move to Indianapolis. Ruth, who has looked forward to join the sophisticated social life in Chicago is also disappointed by the news. Ruth is quite satisfied when they move to Indianapolis and buy a vast strip of land where David starts his new job. Soon, David visits Oxford to watch his father's new horse debut on the track. A mistake by the groom leads to the horse being severely injured, and can only be used for breeding in the future. Dan makes an attempt to breed the horse with Joe Patchen, a reputable stud from Illinois, and the resulting colt is named Dan Patch. The colt soon grows into a strong horse, ready to train for the race track with Dan's horse trainer, Ben Lathrop. One day David gets a visit from Ben and his tomboy teenage daughter Cissy at the estate. The visitors are treated poorly by Ruth, who has turned into an up-and-coming socialité and shows no interest in horse breeding. Ben tells David that Dan Patch has made a record training run before he and his daughter leave. It is not until his aunt Netty sends him a telegram that David learns about his father's illness. He rushes to Oxford and is by his father's side as he passes. David makes a promise to his dying father that he will continue training Dan Patch. For this purpose he brings the horse home with him and builds a race track on the estate. Ruth is not at all happy with the development. As they quarrel, David realizes that he doesn't love her anymore. However, the training is successful, and Dan Patch wins his first race at a county fair. Soon the horse is ready for the big races, and he wins in Detroit, Cleveland and Columbus. In Kentucky, Ben becomes ill and David gets to take his place as a driver. Since the other drivers refuse to race, realizing their horse won't beat Dan Patch, the horse gets to race against time, and breaks the record, running a mile in under two minutes. Because of some trouble at David's regular work at the chemistry company, Ruth tells him to come home and solve it, not willing to risk her high maintenance lifestyle. David sees no other alternative than to return to Indianapolis. When he goes to tell Ben and Cissy, he sees one of the younger drivers, Bud Ransome, talk to Cissy. Later, a fire breaks out in the stables, and David and Cissy manage to put it out, saving the horses. When David comes back to Ruth, he tells her he has decided to sell the estate, quit his job and continue breeding horses instead. She demands a divorce, refusing to live on the farm with him. Rith gets most of their assets in the divorce, and David keeps the farm and Dan Patch. Cissy is overjoyed that he has returned, having had a crush on him for years. David understands he is in love with young Cissy, and together they decide to sell Dan Patch for $60,000 to be able to live on the farm and continue breeding horses. David and Cissy eventually marry and are blessed with a daughter. The horse goes on to break his own record, running a mile in 1 minute fifty-six seconds in 1906. He also makes a lot of money from different commercial deals, involving using his name on promotional goods. In his last race, watched by David and his family, Dan Patch beats his own record by a full second."]}

The Ka-20 was built to demonstrate the feasibility of mounting the turboshaft engines above the cabin and it had no mission equipment or corrosion protection although it was fitted with a nose-mounted radome.

The design was developed as the Ka-25 anti-submarine helicopter."], "neg": ["Helicopter\nHelicopter A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft cannot perform. The English word \"helicopter\" is adapted from the French word , coined by Gustave Ponton d'Amécourt in 1861, which originates from the Greek \"helix\" () \"helix, spiral, whirl, convolution\" and \"pteron\" () \"wing\". English language nicknames for helicopter include \"chopper\", \"copter\", \"helo\", \"heli\", and \"whirlybird\". Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight, with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936. Some helicopters reached limited production, but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production, with 131 aircraft built. Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration. Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity. Coaxial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and compound helicopters are all flying today. Quadcopter helicopters pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones. The earliest references for vertical flight came from China. Since around 400 BC, Chinese children have played with bamboo flying toys (or Chinese top). This bamboo-copter is spun by rolling a stick attached to a rotor. The spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released. The 4th-century AD Daoist book \"Baopuzi\" by Ge Hong (抱朴子 \"Master who Embraces Simplicity\") reportedly describes some of the ideas inherent to rotary wing aircraft. Designs similar to the Chinese helicopter toy appeared in some Renaissance paintings and other works. In the 18th and early 19th centuries Western scientists developed flying machines based on the Chinese toy. It was not until the early 1480s, when Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci created a design for a machine that could be described as an \"aerial screw\", that any recorded advancement was made towards vertical flight. His notes suggested that he built small flying models, but there were no indications for any provision to stop the rotor from making the craft rotate. As scientific knowledge increased and became more accepted, people continued to pursue the idea of vertical flight. In July 1754, Russian Mikhail Lomonosov had developed a small coaxial modeled after the Chinese top but powered by a wound-up spring device and demonstrated it to the Russian Academy of Sciences. It was powered by a spring, and was suggested as a method to lift meteorological instruments. In 1783, Christian de Launoy, and his mechanic, Bienvenu, used a coaxial version of the Chinese top in a model consisting of contrarotating turkey flight feathers as rotor blades, and in 1784, demonstrated it to the French Academy of Sciences. Sir George Cayley, influenced by a childhood fascination with the Chinese flying top, developed a model of feathers, similar to that of Launoy and Bienvenu, but powered by rubber bands. By the end of the century, he had progressed to using sheets of tin for rotor blades and springs for power. His writings on his experiments and models would become influential on future aviation pioneers. Alphonse Pénaud would later develop coaxial rotor model helicopter toys in 1870, also powered by rubber bands. One of these toys, given as a gift by their father, would inspire the Wright brothers to pursue the dream of flight. In 1861, the word \"helicopter\" was coined by Gustave de Ponton d'Amécourt, a French inventor who demonstrated a small steam-powered model. While celebrated as an innovative use of a new metal, aluminum, the model never lifted off the ground. D'Amecourt's linguistic contribution would survive to eventually describe the vertical flight he had envisioned. Steam power was popular with other inventors as well. In 1878 the Italian Enrico Forlanini's unmanned vehicle, also powered by a steam engine, rose to a height of , where it hovered for some 20 seconds after a vertical take-off. Emmanuel Dieuaide's steam-powered design featured counter-rotating rotors powered through a hose from a boiler on the ground. In 1887 Parisian inventor, Gustave Trouvé, built and flew a tethered electric model helicopter. In July 1901, the maiden flight of Hermann Ganswindt's helicopter took place in Berlin-Schöneberg; this was probably the first motor-driven flight carrying humans. A movie covering the event was taken by Max Skladanowsky, but it remains lost. In 1885, Thomas Edison was given US$1,000 by James Gordon Bennett, Jr., to conduct experiments towards developing flight. Edison built a helicopter and used the paper for a stock ticker to create guncotton, with which he attempted to power an internal combustion engine. The helicopter was damaged by explosions and one of his workers was badly burned. Edison reported that it would take a motor with a ratio of three to four pounds per horsepower produced to be successful, based on his experiments. Ján Bahýľ, a Slovak inventor, adapted the internal combustion engine to power his helicopter model that reached a height of in 1901. On 5 May 1905, his helicopter reached in altitude and flew for over . In 1908, Edison patented his own design for a helicopter powered by a gasoline engine with box kites attached to a mast by cables for a rotor, but it never flew. In 1906, two French brothers, Jacques and Louis Breguet, began experimenting with airfoils for helicopters. In 1907, those experiments resulted in the \"Gyroplane No.1\", possibly as the earliest known example of a quadcopter. Although there is some uncertainty about the date, sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907, the Gyroplane No. 1 lifted its pilot into the air about for a minute. The Gyroplane No. 1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady. For this reason, the flights of the Gyroplane No. 1 are considered to be the first manned flight of a helicopter, but not a free or untethered flight. That same year, fellow French inventor Paul Cornu designed and built a Cornu helicopter that used two counter-rotating rotors driven by a Antoinette engine. On 13 November 1907, it lifted its inventor to and remained aloft for 20 seconds. Even though this flight did not surpass the flight of the Gyroplane No. 1, it was reported to be the first truly free flight with a pilot. Cornu's helicopter completed a few more flights and achieved a height of nearly , but it proved to be unstable and was abandoned. In 1911, Slovenian philosopher and economist Ivan Slokar patented a helicopter configuration. The Danish inventor Jacob Ellehammer built the Ellehammer helicopter in 1912. It consisted of a frame equipped with two counter-rotating discs, each of which was fitted with six vanes around its circumference. After indoor tests, the aircraft was demonstrated outdoors and made several free take-offs. Experiments with the helicopter continued until September 1916, when it tipped over during take-off, destroying its rotors. During World War I, Austria-Hungary developed the PKZ, an experimental helicopter prototype, with two aircraft built. In the early 1920s, Argentine Raúl Pateras-Pescara de Castelluccio, while working in Europe, demonstrated one of the first successful applications of cyclic pitch. Coaxial, contra-rotating, biplane rotors could be warped to cyclically increase and decrease the lift they produced. The rotor hub could also be tilted forward a few degrees, allowing the aircraft to move forward without a separate propeller to push or pull it. Pateras-Pescara was also able to demonstrate the principle of autorotation. By January 1924, Pescara's helicopter No. 1 was tested but was found to be underpowered and could not lift its own weight. His 2F fared better and set a record. The British government funded further research by Pescara which resulted in helicopter No. 3, powered by a 250 hp radial engine which could fly for up to ten minutes. On 14 April 1924 Frenchman Étienne Oehmichen set the first helicopter world record recognized by the \"Fédération Aéronautique Internationale\" (FAI), flying his quadrotor helicopter . On 18 April 1924, Pescara beat Oemichen's record, flying for a distance of 736 meters (nearly a half mile) in 4 minutes and 11 seconds (about , maintaining a height of . On 4 May, Oehmichen set the first 1 km closed-circuit helicopter flight in 7 minutes 40 seconds with his No. 2 machine. In the US, George de Bothezat built the quadrotor helicopter de Bothezat helicopter for the United States Army Air Service but the Army cancelled the program in 1924, and the aircraft was scrapped. Albert Gillis von Baumhauer, a Dutch aeronautical engineer, began studying rotorcraft design in 1923. His first prototype \"flew\" (\"hopped\" and hovered in reality) on 24 September 1925, with Dutch Army-Air arm Captain Floris Albert van Heijst at the controls. The controls that van Heijst used were von Baumhauer's inventions, the cyclic and collective. Patents were granted to von Baumhauer for his cyclic and collective controls by the British ministry of aviation on 31 January 1927, under patent number 265,272. In 1927, Engelbert Zaschka from Germany built a helicopter, equipped with two rotors, in which a gyroscope was used to increase stability and serves as an energy accumulator for a gliding flight to make a landing. Zaschka's plane, the first helicopter, which ever worked so successfully in miniature, not only rises and descends vertically, but is able to remain stationary at any height. In 1928, Hungarian aviation engineer Oszkár Asbóth constructed a helicopter prototype that took off and landed at least 182 times, with a maximum single flight duration of 53 minutes. In 1930, the Italian engineer Corradino D'Ascanio built his D'AT3, a coaxial helicopter. His relatively large machine had two, two-bladed, counter-rotating rotors. Control was achieved by using auxiliary wings or servo-tabs on the trailing edges of the blades, a concept that was later adopted by other helicopter designers, including Bleeker and Kaman. Three small propellers mounted to the airframe were used for additional pitch, roll, and yaw control. The D'AT3 held modest FAI speed and altitude records for the time, including altitude (18 m or 59 ft), duration (8 minutes 45 seconds) and distance flown (1,078 m or 3,540 ft). In the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, two aeronautical engineers working at the \"Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut\" (TsAGI or the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute), constructed and flew the TsAGI 1-EA single lift-rotor helicopter, which used an open tubing framework, a four-blade main lift rotor, and twin sets of diameter, two-bladed anti-torque rotors: one set of two at the nose and one set of two at the tail. Powered by two M-2 powerplants, up-rated copies of the Gnome \"Monosoupape\" 9 Type B-2 100 CV output rotary engine of World War I, the TsAGI 1-EA made several low altitude flights. By 14 August 1932, Cheremukhin managed to get the 1-EA up to an unofficial altitude of , shattering d'Ascanio's earlier achievement. As the Soviet Union was not yet a member of the FAI, however, Cheremukhin's record remained unrecognized. Nicolas Florine, a Russian engineer, built the first twin tandem rotor machine to perform a free flight. It flew in Sint-Genesius-Rode, at the \"Laboratoire Aérotechnique de Belgique\" (now von Karman Institute) in April 1933, and attained an altitude of and an endurance of eight minutes. Florine chose a co-rotating configuration because the gyroscopic stability of the rotors would not cancel. Therefore, the rotors had to be tilted slightly in opposite directions to counter torque. Using hingeless rotors and co-rotation also minimised the stress on the hull. At the time, it was one of the most stable helicopters in existence. The Bréguet-Dorand \"Gyroplane Laboratoire\" was built in 1933. It was a coaxial helicopter, contra-rotating. After many ground tests and an accident, it first took flight on 26 June 1935. Within a short time, the aircraft was setting records with pilot Maurice Claisse at the controls. On 14 December 1935, he set a record for closed-circuit flight with a diameter. The next year, on 26 September 1936, Claisse set a height record of . And, finally, on 24 November 1936, he set a flight duration record of one hour, two minutes and 50 seconds over a closed circuit at 44.7 kilometers per hour (27.8 mph). The aircraft was destroyed in 1943 by an Allied airstrike at Villacoublay airport. Arthur M. Young, American inventor, started work on model helicopters in 1928 using converted electric hover motors to drive the rotor head. Young invented the stabilizer bar and patented it shortly after. A mutual friend introduced Young to Lawrence Dale, who once seeing his work asked him to join the Bell Aircraft company. When Young arrived at Bell in 1941, he signed his patent over and began work on the helicopter. His budget was US$250,000 to build 2 working helicopters. In just 6 months they completed the first Bell Model 1, which spawned the Bell Model 30, later succeeded by the Bell 47. Early rotor winged flight suffered failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take-off, due to dissymmetry of lift between the advancing and retreating blades. This major difficulty was resolved by Juan de la Cierva's introduction of the flapping hinge. In 1923, de la Cierva's first successful autogyro was flown in Spain by Lt. Gomez Spencer. In 1925 he brought his C.6 to Britain and demonstrated it to the Air Ministry at Farnborough, Hampshire. This machine had a four blade rotor with flapping hinges but relied upon conventional airplane controls for pitch, roll and yaw. It was based upon an Avro 504K fuselage, initial rotation of the rotor was achieved by the rapid uncoiling of a rope passed around stops on the undersides of the blades. A major problem with the autogyro was driving the rotor before takeoff. Several methods were attempted in addition to the coiled rope system, which could take the rotor speed to 50% of that required, at which point movement along the ground to reach flying speed was necessary, while tilting the rotor to establish autorotation. Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The rotor clutch was then disengaged before the takeoff run. As de la Cierva's autogyros achieved success and acceptance, others began to follow and with them came further innovation. Most important was the development of direct rotor control through cyclic pitch variation, achieved initially by tilting the rotor hub and subsequently by the Austrian engineer Raoul Hafner, by the application of a spider mechanism that acted directly on each rotor blade. The first production direct control autogyro was the C.30, produced in quantity by Avro, Liore et Olivier, and Focke-Wulf. The production model, called the C.30A by Avro, was built under licence in Britain, France and Germany and was similar to the C.30P. It carried small movable trimming surfaces. Each licensee used nationally built engines and used slightly different names. In all, 143 production C.30s were built, making it by far the most numerous pre-war autogyro. Between 1933 and 1936, de la Cierva used one C.30A (\"G-ACWF\") to perfect his last contribution to autogyro development before his death in late 1936. To enable the aircraft to take off without forward ground travel, he produced the \"Autodynamic\" rotor head, which allowed the rotor to be spun up by the engine in the usual way but to higher than take-off r.p.m at zero rotor incidence and then to reach operational positive pitch suddenly enough to jump some"]}

Greek versions of this fable are told of the raven (κοραξ) while it is called a kite (\"milvus\") in Mediaeval Latin sources. The bird is ill and asks its grieving mother to pray in the temples on its behalf. The mother replies that since it was a robber of the sacrifices there, religious observance would now be of no use. The fable appears in the collection of William Caxton and in many others, generally with a reflection on the uselessness of death-bed repentance. In the 1546 edition of the \"Emblemata\" by Andrea Alciato the story is modified. There the bird vomits and is told by its parent that it is losing nothing of its own, since all it has eaten was stolen. The fable is used to illustrate the Latin proverb \"male parta, male dilabuntur\" (ill-gotten, ill-spent). A sceptical variation on the theme directed against religious observance later appeared in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's collection of prose fables (1759). 'The fox, observing that the raven plundered the altars of the gods, and that he supported himself from their sacrifices, said to himself: I should like to know whether the raven partakes of their sacrifices because he is a prophetical bird; or whether he is deemed a prophetical bird because he is so insolent as to partake of the sacrifices?'

It is based on the concept of \"terroir\". The origins of AOC date to the year 1411, when Roquefort was regulated by a parliamentary decree. The first French law on viticultural designations of origin dates to August 1, 1905, whereas the first modern law was set on May 6, 1919, when the Law for the Protection of the Place of Origin was passed, specifying the region and commune in which a given product must be manufactured, and has been revised on many occasions since then. On July 30, 1935, the \"Comité National des appellations d'origine\" (CNAO), with representatives of the government and the major winegrowers, was created to manage the administration of the process for wines at the initiative of deputy Joseph Capus. In the Rhône wine region Baron Pierre Le Roy Boiseaumarié, a trained lawyer and winegrower from Châteauneuf-du-Pape, successfully obtained legal recognition of the \"Côtes du Rhône\" appellation of origin in 1936. After World War II the committee became the public-private \"Institut National des Appellations d'Origine\" (INAO). The AOC seal was created and mandated by French laws in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. On July 2, 1990, the scope of work of the INAO was extended beyond wines to cover other agricultural products . AOCs vary dramatically in size. Some cover vast expanses with a variety of climatic and soil characteristics, while others are small and highly uniform. For example, the Côtes du Rhône AOC \"covers some , but within its area lies one of the smallest AOCs, Château-Grillet, which occupies less than of land.\" The INAO guarantees that all AOC products will hold to a rigorous set of clearly defined standards. The organization stresses that AOC products will be produced in a consistent and traditional manner with ingredients from specifically classified producers in designated geographical areas. The products must further be aged at least partially in the respective designated area. Under French law, it is illegal to manufacture and sell a product under one of the AOC-controlled geographical indications if it does not comply with the criteria of the AOC. AOC products can be identified by a seal, which is printed on the label in wines, and with cheeses, on the rind. To prevent any possible misrepresentation, no part of an AOC name may be used on a label of a product not qualifying for that AOC. This strict label policy can lead to confusion, especially in cases where towns share names with appellations. If the town of origin of a product contains a controlled appellation in its name, the producer (who is legally required to identify the place of origin on the product label but legally prohibited from using the full town's name unless the product is an approved AOC product) is enjoined from listing anything more than a cryptic postal code. For example, there are a dozen townships in l'Aude that have Cabardès in their names, several of which are not even within the geographical boundaries of the Cabardès AOC. Any vineyard that produces wine in one of those towns must not mention the name of the town of origin on the product labels. There are currently over 300 French wines entitled to the designation AOC on their label. Legislation concerning the way vineyards are identified makes recognizing the various AOCs very challenging for wine drinkers not well-acclimated to the system. Often, distinguishing classifications requires knowledge of esoteric label laws such as \"Unless the wine is from a \"Premier Cru\" vineyard, the vineyard name must be printed in characters no more than half the height of the ones used for the village name\" On the other hand, while the process of label approval is enforced to the millimetre, the quality control for the wine in the bottle is much less strict. While a blind taster must approve the wine for it to receive AOC classification, this tasting often occurs before the product is even bottled, and by a local expert who may well have ties to the local vintners. Even if the taster is objective, the wine sample may not be representative of the actual product, and there is almost no way to verify that the finished bottled product is the same as the original AOC sample. In 1925, Roquefort became the first cheese to be awarded an AOC label, and since then over 40 cheeses have been assigned AOC status. On August 15, 1957, the National Assembly gave AOC status to the poultry of Bresse (Poulet de Bresse). In 2006, it awarded AOC status to salt marsh lamb raised in the Bay of the Somme. In 1981, the AOC label was given to Haute-Provence Lavender Essential Oil. It refers to a very high-quality production and concerns only the essential oil of fine lavender - \"Lavandula angustifolia\". The fields must be located within a specific territory at a minimum altitude of 800 meters. This geographic area covers 284 communities in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes-Alpes, Drôme and Vaucluse regions. Lentils from Le Puy-en-Velay have AOC status. (See: Le Puy Green lentil.) Honey from the island of Corsica has been given AOC status. There are six certified varietals of Corsican honey: Printemps, Maquis de printemps, Miellats du maquis, Châtaigneraie, Maquis d'été, and Maquis d'automne. France recognizes the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Vienne, Deux-Sèvres and Vendée AOC regions for butter.<br> The Beurre Charentes-Poitou has been assigned AOC status in 1979. Armagnac, Calvados, Cognac and Martinique Rhum Agricole all have AOC status. Many other countries have based their controlled place name systems on the French AOC classification. Italy's Denominazione di Origine Controllata and Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita followed the model set by the French AOC, and the EU standard for Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWpsr) also corresponds closely. While Spain's Denominación de Origen is very similar, the classification of Rioja in 1925 and Sherry in 1933 preceded the French AOC system by a few years and show that Spain's DdO system developed parallel to France's AOC system to some extent. Similarly, Germany's Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete is a wine classification system based on geographic region, but it differs from the AOC in important ways. Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete wines are commonly seen as less prestigious than Qualitätswein mit Prädikat, making it more similar to the Vin de Pays or Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure systems. Portugal's Denominação de Origem Controlada, Austria's Districtus Austria Controllatus, South Africa's Wine of Origin, and Switzerland's AOC-IGP are all similar to the French AOC system as well. It appears also that AOC influenced the development of the European Union's protected designation of origin (PDO) system. Switzerland has an \"appellation d'origine contrôlée\" certification for wines and an \"appellation d'origine protégée\" certification for other food products. Before 2013, the \"appellation d'origine contrôlée\" was used for all products. The United States' American Viticultural Areas also follows the model set by the French AOC. The United States Department of the Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau even uses the legal terminology \"Appellation of Wine Origin\" to describe a vintage wine's location of origin. The AVA indication on a label indicates that 85% of the grapes for wine are grown in the designated AVA. Overall, the appellation of a wine simply says where the grapes are from, although there are some particularities. If the appellation is a state, 100% of the grapes which go into the wine must come from the specific state. If a winery gets grapes from a neighboring state (for example, a California vintner getting Pinot noir from Oregon), it may label the wine \"Oregon\", but if the state is not a neighboring one (for example, a California vintner getting Cabernet from Washington state), the only permitted appellation is \"American.\" In Canada, there is a government-sanctioned wine standard called Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA). It only applies to Canadian wines, and only the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia regulate it. Outside their home country, protecting the AOC status of certain products can face challenges, notably from a legal perspective. Some countries do not uphold a geographical indication system for their own products and thus, products which are labelled AOC in France, for instance, can be confronted on the international stage with foreign products claiming a similar geographical origin, even though it has not been recognized as such by the AOC system. In such a case, France (or another country) may enter into bilateral agreements with other countries, whereupon the signatories accept to recognize a special status to a list of designated products, or it can also seek the development of rules or agreements at the World Trade Organization level. Since each country has its own legal and agricultural framework, the specifics of each trade relationship are likely to vary. Also, there are often conflicts between trademarks and geographical indications. For instance, in Canada, only Canadian wines can be VQA approved but other certification trademarks can be registered under the intellectual property legal regime. The owner of a certification trademark is then allowed to sell licences to be used for certain products meeting the owner's criteria. Thus in the case of wines, one AOC certification trademark is owned by the French Republic, while another is owned by \"Maison des Futailles\", a wine producer, of which the publicly owned Société des alcools du Québec is a partner."], "neg": ["La Tâche AOC\nLa Tâche AOC La Tâche is an \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. It is situated within the commune of Vosne-Romanée and is a monopole of the winery Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. La Tâche borders on La Grande Rue in the north, and mostly on Vosne-Romanée Premier Cru vineyards in the east, south and west. The AOC was created in 1936. The vineyard received its current name, which means \"task\", when the de Croonembourg family bought it from the Abbey Saint-Vivant in 1631. At this time, the vineyard called La Tâche covered a slightly smaller area than the current AOC. The de Croonembourgs had simultaneously purchased Romanée-Conti, which at that time was named La Romanée. In 1760, both of these vineyards were sold by André de Croonembourg and ended up in the hands of different buyers. At this time, La Tâche came to fame, since Louis François I de Bourbon, the Prince of Conti who had bought and renamed Romanée-Conti, kept that vineyard's production for his own consumption, leaving La Tâche as the finest commercially available Vosne wine. In 1791, La Tâche was bought by the Marey family, which were also vineyard owners in Romanée-Saint-Vivant. In 1793, following the French Revolution, La Tâche was sequestered by the state, and sold 1794, simultaneously with Romanée-Conti. In 1855, when Dr. Jules Lavalle published his classification of the Burgundy vineyards, La Tâche was one of those placed in the highest of five categories, \"tête de cuvée\". Up until 1932, the neighbouring vineyard of Les Gaudichots could be sold either under its own name or as La Tâche. In this year the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, which owned vineyards in Les Gaudichots applied to have it merged into La Tâche. This was opposed by Liger-Belair who owned the smaller, and historical La Tâche. However, Liger-Belair lost and most of Les Gaudichots was absorbed into La Tâche, except for some parts that were deemed to be of Premier Cru rather than Grand Cru quality, and which have remained a separate vineyard under the name Vosnée-Romanée Les Gaudichots, consisting of three discontinuous plots. In 1933, following the death of the Comtesse Liger-Belair in 1931, Liger-Belair's vineyards had to be auctioned off, including their La Tâche holding, and it ended up with Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Since 1985, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti has practiced organic farming in the vineyard. In 2008, of vineyard surface was in production within the AOC, and 95 hectoliters of wine was produced, corresponding to just under 12,700 bottles. The five-year average annual production of the period 2003–2007 was somewhat higher, 151 hl, corresponding to just over 20,000 bottles. The main grape variety for La Tâche is Pinot noir. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes, but this is practically never used for any Burgundy Grand Cru vineyard. The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare, a minimum planting density of 9,000 vines per hectare and a minimum grape maturity of 11.5 per cent potential alcohol is required. The actual yield over the period 2003-2007 was 30 hl/ha."]}

It consisted of two distinct divisions, each with its own unique operating parameters. It provided passenger service to the western Illinois cities of Rock Island, Monmouth and Galesburg for two decades, with freight service surviving into the 1950s on the barest remnants of a once-impressive system. The older of the two RIS divisions was the line from Monmouth east to Galesburg, which was called Western Illinois Traction prior to completion of the line. By the time this 19-mile segment was put into service in May 1906 it had become part of the RIS. This division operated on 600 volts DC electric power and used typical interurban standards, with tighter curves and narrower rolling stock than in use on mainline railroads. Passenger service was operated for two decades, ceasing in 1926 following a decline in ridership brought on by increased automobile use. Freight service continued to be provided by an assortment of electric locomotives and box motors, but during and after World War II even freight traffic declined precipitously. All service over this division was abandoned on March 30, 1951. The better known of the two RIS divisions was the line from Monmouth north to Rock Island, which took several years to build and was completed in late 1910. Unlike the line to Galesburg, this division was built to mainline railroad standards. The long cuts, fills and high trestles that the line used to traverse the hilly Mississippi Valley country south of Rock Island were notable features of this division. Freight was hauled by steam locomotives but the line was also electrified using a single-phase high voltage AC system which was unusual among interurban lines. Large interurban cars bought secondhand from the Washington Baltimore and Annapolis were used. The line leased Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific tracks from downtown Rock Island to Southern Junction and from Milan to Sherrard; in addition to the main line there were branches to Aledo and Alexis. With the abandonment of passenger service in 1926 the northern division was de-electrified, but freight service continued. In 1929 a trestle near Burgess burned, breaking the line in two, and over the following two decades the line gradually shrank back towards Rock Island as trestles rotted away and collapsed. This slow death culminated in the last run of a RIS steam engine in Rock Island in February 1952."]}
{"query": "Mandatory Integrity Control limitations instead of its benefits in UIPI", "pos": ["Mandatory Integrity Control\nMandatory Integrity Control In the context of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) is a core security feature introduced in Windows Vista and implemented in subsequent desktop line of Windows operating systems, that adds \"Integrity Levels\" (IL)-based isolation to running processes. The IL represents the level of trustworthiness of an object. This mechanism's goal is to use pre-existing integrity control policies and the involved objects' IL to selectively restrict the access permissions in contexts that are considered to be potentially less trustworthy, compared with other contexts running under the same user account that are more trusted. Mandatory Integrity Control is defined using a new access control entry (ACE) type to represent the object's IL in its security descriptor. In Windows, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to grant access rights (read, write, and execute permissions) and privileges to users or groups. An IL is assigned to a subject's access token when initialized. When the subject tries to access an object (for example, a file), the Security Reference Monitor compares the integrity level in the subject's access token against the integrity level in the object's security descriptor. Windows restricts the allowed access rights depending on whether the subject's IL is higher or lower than the object, and depending on the integrity policy flags in the new access control entry (ACE). The security subsystem implements the integrity level as a mandatory label to distinguish it from the discretionary access under user control that ACLs provide. Windows Vista defines four integrity levels: \"Low\" (\"SID:\" S-1-16-4096), \"Medium\" (\"SID:\" S-1-16-8192), \"High\" (\"SID:\" S-1-16-12288), and \"System\" (\"SID:\" S-1-16-16384). By default, processes started by a regular user gain a \"Medium\" IL and elevated processes have \"High\" IL. By introducing integrity levels, MIC allows classes of applications to be isolated, enabling scenarios like sandboxing potentially-vulnerable applications (such as Internet-facing applications). Processes with \"Low\" IL are called low-integrity processes, which have less access than processes with higher ILs where the Access control enforcement is in Windows. Objects with Access control lists, such as Named objects, including files, registry keys or even other processes and threads, have an entry in the System Access Control List governing access to them, that defines the minimum integrity level of the process that can use the object. Windows makes sure that a process can \"write to\" or \"delete\" an object only when its integrity level is equal to or higher than the requested integrity level specified by the object. Additionally, for privacy reasons process objects with higher IL are out-of-bounds for even \"read\" access from processes with lower IL. Consequently, a process cannot interact with another process that has a higher IL. So a process cannot perform functions such as inject a DLL into a higher IL process by using the codice_1 API function or send data to a different process by using the codice_2 function. While processes inherit the integrity level of the process that spawned it, the integrity level can be customized at the time of process creation. As well as for defining the boundary for window messages in the User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) technology, Mandatory Integrity Control is used by applications like Adobe Reader, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Windows Explorer to isolate documents from vulnerable objects in the system.  Internet Explorer 7 introduces a MIC-based \"Protected Mode\" setting to control whether a web page is opened as a low-integrity process or not (provided the operating system supports MIC), based on security zone settings, thereby preventing some classes of security vulnerabilities. Since Internet Explorer in this case runs as a Low IL process, it cannot modify system level objects—file and registry operations are instead virtualized. Adobe Reader 10 and Google Chrome are two other notable applications that are introducing the technology in order to reduce their vulnerability to malware. Microsoft Office 2010 introduced the \"Protected View\" isolated sandbox environment for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word that prohibits potentially unsafe documents from modifying components, files, and other resources on a system. Protected View operates as a low-integrity process and, in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, uses MIC and UIPI to further restrict the sandbox. However, in some cases a higher IL process do need to execute certain functions against the lower IL process, or a lower IL process need to access resources that only a higher IL process can access (for example, when viewing a webpage in protected mode, save a file downloaded from the internet to a folder specified by the user). High IL and Low IL processes can still communicate with each other by using files, Named pipes, LPC or other shared objects. The shared object must have an integrity level as low as the Low IL process and should be shared by both the Low IL and High IL processes. Since MIC does not prevent a Low IL process from sharing objects with a higher IL process, it can trigger flaws in the higher IL process and have it work on behalf of the low IL process, thereby causing a Squatting attack. Shatter attacks, however, can be prevented by using User Interface Privilege Isolation which takes advantage of MIC."], "neg": ["System Integrity Protection\nSystem Integrity Protection System Integrity Protection (SIP, sometimes referred to as rootless) is a security feature of Apple's macOS operating system introduced in OS X El Capitan. It comprises a number of mechanisms that are enforced by the kernel. A centerpiece is the protection of system-owned files and directories against modifications by processes without a specific \"entitlement\", even when executed by the root user or a user with root privileges (sudo).  Apple says that the root user can be a significant risk factor to the system's security, especially on systems with a single user account on which that user is also the administrator. System Integrity Protection is enabled by default, but can be disabled. Apple says that System Integrity Protection is a necessary step to ensure a high level of security. In one of the WWDC developer sessions, Apple engineer Pierre-Olivier Martel described unrestricted root access as one of the remaining weaknesses of the system, saying that \"[any] piece of malware is one password or vulnerability away from taking full control of the device\". He stated that most installations of macOS have only one user account that necessarily carries administrative credentials with it, which means that most users can grant root access to any program that asks for it. Whenever a user on such a system is prompted and enters their account password – which Martel says is often weak or non-existent – the security of the entire system is potentially compromised. Restricting the power of root is not unprecedented on macOS. For instance, versions of macOS prior to Mac OS X Leopard enforce of securelevel, a security feature that originates in BSD and its derivatives upon which macOS is partially based. System Integrity Protection comprises the following mechanisms: System Integrity Protection protects system files and directories that are flagged for protection. This happens either by adding an extended file attribute to a file or directory, by adding the file or directory to /System/Library/Security/rootless.conf or both. Among the protected directories are: /System, /bin, /sbin, /usr (but not /usr/local). The symbolic links from /etc, /tmp and /var to /private/etc, /private/tmp and /private/var are also protected, although the target directories are not themselves protected. Most preinstalled Apple applications in /Applications are protected as well. The kernel stops all processes without specific entitlements from modifying the permissions and contents of flagged files and directories and also prevents code injection, runtime attachment and DTrace with respect to protected executables.  Since OS X Yosemite, kernel extensions, such as drivers, have to be code-signed with a particular Apple entitlement. Developers have to request a developer ID with such an entitlement from Apple. The kernel refuses to boot if unsigned extensions are present, showing the user a prohibition sign instead. This mechanism, called \"kext signing\", was integrated into System Integrity Protection. System Integrity Protection can only be disabled (either wholly or partly) from outside of the system partition. To that end, Apple provides the csrutil command-line utility which can be executed from a Terminal window within the recovery system or a bootable macOS installation disk, which adds a boot argument to the device's NVRAM. This applies the setting to all of the installations of El Capitan or macOS Sierra on the device. Upon installation of macOS, the installer moves any unknown components within flagged system directories to /Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-\"[some UUID]\"/QuarantineRoot/. By preventing write access to system directories, the system file and directory permissions are maintained automatically during Apple software updates. As a result, permissions repair is not available in Disk Utility and the corresponding diskutil operation. Reception of System Integrity Protection has been mixed. \"Macworld\" expressed the concern that Apple could take full control away from users and developers in future releases and move the security policy of macOS slowly toward that of Apple's mobile operating system iOS, whereupon the installation of many utilities and modifications requires jailbreaking. Some applications and drivers will not work to their full extent or cannot be operated at all unless the feature is disabled, either temporarily or permanently. \"Ars Technica\" suggested that this could affect smaller developers disproportionately, as larger ones may be able to work with Apple directly. However, they also remarked that by far most users, including power users, will not have a reason to turn the feature off, saying that there are \"almost no downsides\" to it."]}

The office was created in 1773, with the title of \"Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William\". The officer had direct control only over Fort William, but supervised other East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833, and the official came to be known as the \"Governor-General of India\". In 1858, as a consequence of the Indian Mutiny the previous year, the territories and assets of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British Crown; as a consequence the Company Raj was succeeded by the British Raj. The Governor-General (now also the Viceroy) headed the central government of India, which administered the provinces of British India, including the Punjab, Bengal, Bombay, Madras, the United Provinces, and others. However, much of India was not ruled directly by the British Government; outside the provinces of British India, there were hundreds of nominally independent princely states or \"native states\", whose relationship was not with the British Government or the United Kingdom, but rather one of homage directly with the British Monarch as sovereign successor to the Mughal Emperors. From 1858, to reflect the Governor-General's new additional role as the Monarch's representative in re the fealty relationships vis the princely states, the additional title of Viceroy was granted, such that the new office was entitled \"Viceroy and Governor-General of India\". This was usually shortened to \"Viceroy of India\". The title of Viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, but the office of Governor-General continued to exist in each country separately—until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956, respectively. Until 1858, the Governor-General was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the British Government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the UK Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him or her on the exercise of their powers. After 1947, the Sovereign continued to appoint the Governor-General, but thereafter did so on the advice of the newly-sovereign Indian Government. Governors-General served at the pleasure of the Sovereign, though the practice was to have them serve five-year terms. Governors-General could have their commission rescinded; and if one was removed, or left, a provisional Governor-General was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen. The first Governor-General of British India was Lord William Bentinck, and the first Governor-General of independent India was Louis, Lord Mountbatten. Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were governed by the East India Company, which nominally acted as the agent of the Mughal Emperor. In 1773, motivated by corruption in the Company, the British government assumed partial control over the governance of India with the passage of the Regulating Act of 1773. A Governor-General and Supreme Council of Bengal were appointed to rule over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. The first Governor-General and Council were named in the Act. The Charter Act 1833 replaced the Governor-General and Council of Fort William with the Governor-General and Council of India. The power to elect the Governor-General was retained by the Court of Directors, but the choice became subject to the Sovereign's approval. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the East India Company's territories in India were put under the direct control of the Sovereign. The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the Governor-General in the Sovereign. The Governor-General, in turn, had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India, subject to the Sovereign's approval. India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but Governors-General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma remained Governor-General of India for some time after independence, but the two nations were otherwise headed by native Governors-General. India became a secular republic in 1950; Pakistan became an Islamic one in 1956... The Governor-General originally had power only over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. The Regulating Act, however, granted them additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence. The other Presidencies of the East India Company (Madras, Bombay and Bencoolen) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the Governor-General and Council of Fort William. The powers of the Governor-General, in respect of foreign affairs, were increased by the India Act 1784. The Act provided that the other Governors under the East India Company could not declare war, make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the Governor-General or by the Company's Court of Directors. While the Governor-General thus became the controller of foreign policy in India, he was not the explicit head of British India. That status came only with the Charter Act 1833, which granted him \"superintendence, direction and control of the whole civil and military Government\" of all of British India. The Act also granted legislative powers to the Governor-General and Council. After 1858, the Governor-General (now usually known as the Viceroy) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the Sovereign's representative. India was divided into numerous provinces, each under the head of a governor, Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator. Governors were appointed by the British Government, to whom they were directly responsible; Lieutenant Governors, Chief Commissioners, and Administrators, however, were appointed by and were subordinate to the Viceroy. The Viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers: the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja (Scindia) of Gwalior, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad (Gaekwar) Maharaja of Baroda. The remaining princely rulers were overseen either by the Rajputana Agency and Central India Agency, which were headed by representatives of the Viceroy, or by provincial authorities. The Chamber of Princes was an institution established in 1920 by a Royal Proclamation of King-Emperor George V to provide a forum in which the princely rulers could voice their needs and aspirations to the government. The chamber usually met only once a year, with the Viceroy presiding, but it appointed a Standing Committee, which met more often. Upon independence in August 1947, the title of Viceroy was abolished. The representative of the British Sovereign became known once again as the Governor-General. C. Rajagopalachari became the only Indian Governor-General. However, once India acquired independence, the Governor-General's role became almost entirely ceremonial, with power being exercised on a day-to-day basis by the Indian cabinet. After the nation became a republic in 1950, the President of India continued to perform the same functions. The Governor-General was always advised by a Council on the exercise of his legislative and executive powers. The Governor-General, while exercising many functions, was referred to as the \"Governor-General in Council.\" The Regulating Act 1773 provided for the election of four counsellors by the East India Company's Court of Directors. The Governor-General had a vote along with the counsellors, but he also had an additional vote to break ties. The decision of the Council was binding on the Governor-General. In 1784, the Council was reduced to three members; the Governor-General continued to have both an ordinary vote and a casting vote. In 1786, the power of the Governor-General was increased even further, as Council decisions ceased to be binding. The Charter Act 1833 made further changes to the structure of the Council. The Act was the first law to distinguish between the executive and legislative responsibilities of the Governor-General. As provided under the Act, there were to be four members of the Council elected by the Court of Directors. The first three members were permitted to participate on all occasions, but the fourth member was only allowed to sit and vote when legislation was being debated. In 1858, the Court of Directors ceased to have the power to elect members of the Council. Instead, the one member who had a vote only on legislative questions came to be appointed by the Sovereign, and the other three members by the Secretary of State for India. The Indian Councils Act 1861 made several changes to the Council's composition. Three members were to be appointed by the Secretary of State for India, and two by the Sovereign. (The power to appoint all five members passed to the Crown in 1869). The Viceroy was empowered to appoint an additional six to twelve members (changed to ten to sixteen in 1892, and to sixty in 1909). The five individuals appointed by the Sovereign or the Indian Secretary headed the executive departments, while those appointed by the Viceroy debated and voted on legislation. In 1919, an Indian legislature, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly, took over the legislative functions of the Viceroy's Council. The Viceroy nonetheless retained significant power over legislation. He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature's consent for \"ecclesiastical, political [and] defense\" purposes, and for any purpose during \"emergencies.\" He was permitted to veto, or even stop debate on, any bill. If he recommended the passage of a bill, but only one chamber cooperated, he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber. The Legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence. The President of the Council of State was appointed by the Viceroy; the Legislative Assembly elected its President, but the election required the Viceroy's approval. Until 1833, the title of the position was \"Governor-General of Bengal\". The Government of India Act 1833 converted the title into \"Governor-General of India.\" The title \"Viceroy and Governor-General\" was first used in the queen's proclamation appointing Viscount Canning in 1858. It was never conferred by an act of parliament, but was used in warrants of precedence and in the statutes of knightly orders. In usage, \"viceroy\" is employed where the governor-general's position as the monarch's representative is in view. The viceregal title was not used when the sovereign was present in India. It was meant to indicate new responsibilities, especially ritualistic ones, but it conferred no new statutory authority. The governor-general regularly used the title in communications with the Imperial Legislative Council, but all legislation was made only in the name of the Governor-General-in-Council (or the Government of India). The Governor-General was styled \"Excellency\" and enjoyed precedence over all other government officials in India. He was referred to as 'His Excellency' and addressed as 'Your Excellency'. From 1858 to 1947, the Governor-General was known as the Viceroy of India (from the French \"roi\", meaning 'king'), and wives of Viceroys were known as Vicereines (from the French \"reine\", meaning 'queen'). The Vicereine was referred to as 'Her Excellency' and was also addressed as 'Your Excellency'. Neither title was employed while the Sovereign was in India. However, the only reigning British Sovereign to visit India during the period of British rule was King George V, who accompanied by his consort Queen Mary attended the Delhi Durbar in 1911. When the Order of the Star of India was founded in 1861, the Viceroy was made its Grand Master \"ex officio\". The Viceroy was also made the \"ex officio\" Grand Master of the Order of the Indian Empire upon its foundation in 1877. Most Governors-General and Viceroys were peers. Frequently, a Viceroy who was already a peer would be granted a peerage of higher rank, as with the granting of a marquessate to Lord Reading and an earldom and later a marquessate to Freeman Freeman-Thomas. Of those Viceroys who were not peers, Sir John Shore was a baronet, and Lord William Bentinck was entitled to the courtesy title 'Lord' because he was the son of a Duke. Only the first and last Governors-GeneralWarren Hastings and Chakravarti Rajagopalacharias well as some provisional Governors-General, had no honorific titles at all. From around 1885, the Viceroy of India was allowed to fly a Union Flag augmented in the centre with the 'Star of India' surmounted by a Crown. This flag was not the Viceroy's personal flag; it was also used by Governors, Lieutenant Governors, Chief Commissioners and other British officers in India. When at sea, only the Viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast, while other officials flew it from the foremast. From 1947 to 1950, the Governor-General of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest (a lion standing on the Crown), beneath which was the word 'India' in gold majuscules. The same design is still used by many other Commonwealth Realm Governors-General. This last flag was the personal flag of the Governor-General only. The Governor-General of Fort William resided in Belvedere House, Calcutta, until the early nineteenth century, when Government House was constructed. In 1854, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal took up residence there. Now, the Belvedere Estate houses the National Library of India. Lord Wellesley, who is reputed to have said that ‘India should be governed from a palace, not from a country house’, constructed a grand mansion, known as Government House, between 1799 and 1803. The mansion remained in use until the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912. Thereafter, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House, was upgraded to a full Governor and transferred to Government House. Now, it serves as the residence of the Governor of the Indian state of West Bengal, and is referred to by its Bengali name Raj Bhavan. After the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi, the Viceroy occupied the newly built Viceroy's House, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Though construction began in 1912, it did not conclude until 1929; the palace was not formally inaugurated until 1931. The final cost exceeded £877,000 (over £35,000,000 in modern terms)more than twice the figure originally allocated. Today the residence, now known by the Hindi name of 'Rashtrapati Bhavan', is used by the President of India. Throughout the British administration, Governors-General retreated to the Viceregal Lodge \"(Rashtrapati Niwas)\" at Shimla each summer to escape the heat, and the government of India moved with them.

{"query": "Silvio Berlusconi business ventures instead of Italian politics\")\n\n```", "pos": ["Berlusconism\nBerlusconism Berlusconism () is a term used in the Western media and by some Italian analysts to describe the political positions of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The term \"Berlusconism\" emerged in the 1980s, characterised by a strongly positive connotation as synonym of the \"entrepreneurial optimism\" of the time, defined as an entrepreneurial spirit which is not discouraged by difficulties, with a confidence in being able to solve problems. However, starting in the 21st century and in consequence of the increasing identification of Berlusconi as a primarily political figure, the attributed meaning changed in the context of journalistic and political language. According to the Italian definition given by the online vocabulary of the Encyclopedia Institute, Berlusconism has a wide range of meanings, all having their origins in the figure of Berlusconi and the political movement inspired by him: the substantive refers not only to the \"thought movement\", but also to the \"social phenomenon\" and even the phenomenon \"of custom\" bound to his entrepreneurial and political figure. The term Berlusconism is also used to refer to a certain \"laissez-faire\" vision supported by him, not only of the economy and the markets, but also with reference to the same policy. According to his political opponents and business rivals, Berlusconism is only a form of demagogic populism, comparable to fascism, stressing the fact that Berlusconi has declared his admiration for Benito Mussolini, even though he has criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews. His supporters instead compare Berlusconism to the French Gaullism and the Argentine Peronism. Berlusconi defines himself and by extension Berlusconism as moderate, liberal and pro-free trade (\"liberismo\"), but he is often accused of being a populist and a conservative. After his resignation in 2011, Berlusconi has become increasingly Eurosceptical and he is often critical of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. A feature of Berlusconi's leadership tactics is to use the party as a mean to gain power (with the party described as a \"light party\" because of its lack of a complex internal structure). This is decidedly comparable to the political tactics used by Charles De Gaulle in France. Another feature of great importance is the emphasis on a \"liberal revolution\", publicised and summarised by the \"Contract with the Italians\" of 2001. A strong reformism is added to these pillars, principally of the form of the Italian state and the constitution\" in favour of moving from a parliamentary system to a semi-presidential system, a higher election threshold, the abolition of the Senate, the halving in size of the Chamber of Deputies, the abolition of the provinces and the reform of the judiciary, with separation of the careers between magistrates and magistrates's civil responsibility, from Berlusconi considered impartial. Berlusconi has declared himself to be persecuted by the judiciary, having undergone 34 processes, accusing them of being manipulated by the political left and comparing himself to Enzo Tortora as a victim of a miscarriage of justice. More recently, Berlusconi has declared himself in favour of civil unions. A number of writers and political commentators consider Berlusconi's political success a precedent for the 2016 election of real estate tycoon Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, with most noting Berlusconi's panned Prime Minister tenure and therefore making the comparison in dismay. Roger Cohen of \"The New York Times\" argued: \"Widely ridiculed, endlessly written about, long unscathed by his evident misogyny and diverse legal travails, Berlusconi proved a Teflon politician [...] Nobody who knows Berlusconi and has watched the rise and rise of Donald Trump can fail to be struck by the parallels\".

{"query": "Rainbow Fish moral lessons beyond commercial success and TV adaptations", "pos": ["Rainbow Fish\nRainbow Fish The Rainbow Fish is a children's book drawn and written by Marcus Pfister, Swiss author and illustrator, and translated into English by J. Alison James. The book is best known for its morals about the value of being an individual and for the distinctive shiny foil scales of Rainbow Fish. Decode Entertainment turned the story into an animated television series of the same name, which had aired on the HBO Family television channel in the United States and Teletoon in Canada from 1999 until 2001. The story is about a fish with shiny, multi-colored scales named the Rainbow Fish. He has blue, green, and purple scales; and among them, he has shiny silver scales he is always fond of, until one day, a small fish asks him if he could have one, to which the Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The other fish are very upset about his behavior and don't want to play with him anymore. Feeling upset, his only remaining friend, the starfish, tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. The Rainbow Fish finds the octopus and asks what he should do. When he goes to the cave, he sees the octopus. And when he meets the octopus, she says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she tells Rainbow Fish that he must share the beauty of his scales with his friends (which means \"to give one glittering scale to each of the other fish\"). She tells him to share his scales with each of the other fish. And she continues to him that he may no longer be the most beautiful fish in the ocean, but he will discover how to be happy.  When he encounters the small fish a second time, the Rainbow Fish gives him one of his precious scales and, seeing the joy of this little fish, immediately feels much better. Very soon the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by other fish requesting scales and he gives to each of them one of his shiny scales. Finally, in the end, despite having one shiny scale left (as he has given them all away to the other fish), he becomes very happy. Reviewers have called this a \"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\" and a reminder that \"sharing brings happiness and acceptance,\" but the moral of the book has become a widely debated topic. Interpretations include rejection of individuality and promotion of socialism. Other interpretations include influencing children to give away their body and bodily autonomy to indulge the wants of others at their own expense. The message is seen as especially negative for girls and women who are only to be liked if they give away their \"shiny parts\".  On March 25 1997, an animated adaptation of the book was released on VHS and DVD. The home video releases also contain the film \"Dazzle the Dinosaur\" which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \"Giving Makes You Special\". \"Rainbow Fish\" was adapted into a children's animated television series. However, the television series does not follow the plot of the book; rather it takes the character and the setting and creates a new story with them. Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after Neptune, god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \"The School of Fish\". There is a shipwreck called \"Shipwreck Park\" in the series that resembles the wreck of the RMS Titanic.

It was an official selection at the Blue Ocean Film Festival, Idyllwild Film Festival, San Francisco Ocean Film Festival, Catalina Film Festival and. It has also screened around the country, including at the University of Colorado and at University of Massachusetts Amherst. The documentary examines different methods used in modern aquaculture from Atlantic bluefin tuna ocean pens, to trout closed system farms, to old fashioned carp farms and concludes that the fish from lower in the food chain is better for sustainable aquaculture. Two friends, Ted Caplow (an ecological engineer) and Andy Danylchuk They visit a high tech seabass farm, partly automated and equipped with video surveillance. While this is one of the more efficient ways of raising fish since the fish farmers can use the minimum amount of feed to fatten their fish, it is very expensive. It also causes a lot of waste and pollution with excess feed and fish waste falling below the cage. Caplow and Danulchuk set out to define sustainable aquaculture in Turkey to see how it could apply to the rest of the world. They are surprised to find that the fish meal used to feed farmed fish is made of wild caught fish in South America. Between the food production and waste produced by offshore fish farms, Caplow and Danylchuck are concerned these methods are unsustainable. The tuna ranch they visit next is by far the most modern operation they come across. Watching the harvesting process and learning about the amount of technology and fish feed required to produce a pound of Atlantic bluefin tuna, Caplow and Danylchuk conclude that it is also the least sustainable. It also removes fish from the open ocean that have not had a chance to spawn yet, which affects the wild populations. Caplow decides that the ideal fish farm uses a minimal amount of energy, cause a minimal amount of pollution and involve growing fish that are as low on the food chain as possible. Caplow and Danylchuk visit an inland seabass and seabream farm in the Muğla Province, that uses dug out pens supplied by a salt water spring. Not only did they find that this farm uses less energy but the fish looked and tasted better. At a trout farm in the Taurus mountains, Caplow is impressed by the management of their freshwater streams, recycling the water several times through each stage of the fish growing process from egg to fish before allowing it to rejoin the stream. But the problem remains that the fish from their feed comes from far away, and the trout must themselves be transported long distances to reach consumers. Next they visit a restaurant come fish farm in the Saklikent canyon, that raises their fish directly across the street from where they are later eaten by consumers. This provides the smallest waste of energy since virtually no fuel is needed to transport the fish. Finally, they visit a carp farm in Burdur Province, an inland farm where the fish feed very low on the food chain. The feed conversion ratio is much lower than in the carnivorous fish they had seen. The fish waste was used to grow vegetables, and the waste water flowed downstream to nourish farms. Caplow and Danylchuk discuss the differences between eating from the sea and eating from land. The range of types of fish production is very broad, whereas eating say a cow is very specialized and polluting. However, the variety of fish will inevitably diminish with time as more fish species become overfished. Aquaculture will be the only way to eat fish, and if it is done in a sustainable way it could be the answer to feeding a growing human population. The film concludes that the least sustainable fish farming method they saw was also the newest, raising an endangered species, a disruptive fishing method, requiring a lot of fish to feed them. The most sustainable fish was also the oldest, raising an abundant species of fish feeding low on the food chain, using an ancient technique.  A 29-minute version of the documentary was released at the beginning of 2012. A longer, Academic version was released in mid-2012 at 52 minutes. The documentary has been well-received by the scientific community as well as by sustainable aquaculture advocates such as celebrity chef Barton Seaver, CEO of CleanFish Tim Oshea, and filmmaker Ana Joanes (director of Fresh). Céline Cousteau liked the movie, saying \"\"I appreciate how the message was shared: it's not about being against fish farming, it's about doing it right!\" Honorable mention at Blue Ocean film festival in the Innovations and Solutions category"]}

Jiménez is a patronymic construction from the modern-styled given name \"Jimeno\", plus the Spanish suffix \"-ez\", meaning \"son [of]\". The root appears to stem from Basque \"semen\" ('son'), attested in the Aquitanian inscriptions as \"Sembeconnis\" and like forms. Variants of the surname include the archaic Ximénez, Ximenes, as well as Giménez, Gimenes, Jimenes, Chiménez, Chimenes, Seménez and Semenes. In Spanish orthography, the variations of \"Jiménez\" that end with a \"z\" are written with an acute accent on the second syllable. In English, all variations are commonly written without the diacritic. In Portuguese orthography, there is no diacritic used for Ximenes. As the modern name \"Ximenes\" has an \"-es\" suffix, it is almost certainly of Portuguese, Galician or Old Spanish origin, as the orthographic change to \"-ez\" (and indeed, the consonant shift from X to J) was revised in Spain only in the late 18th century. This obviously was not the case in Portugal. Other languages in Castilian-dominated lands like Aragon, Asturias, Galicia, etc. often retained the \"-es\" ending, and their descendants bear witness to this historical anomaly. In Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearics, the ending \"-is\" is used instead of \"-es\" (or \"-ez\"), hence, the spelling Ximenis (or the variant with vowel epenthesis, Eiximinis or Eximenis). The name Ximenes itself is thought to derive as both surname and place name from the common Iberian territory of Galicia, since Lusophone linguists believe the Galician language is the forebear of both Modern Portuguese and Modern Spanish. Ximenes, as such, exists most commonly in Portugal, and in all of the ex-Portuguese Crown territories, especially in Brazil. Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, Nobel Laureate from East Timor in 1996, and Brazilian actress, Mariana Ximenes, are prime examples of this historical difference.

Those opposed to such policies state that they seek a more \"even-handed\" U.S. approach to the conflict in the Middle East. Caroline Glick, managing editor of \"The Jerusalem Post\", writes in an opinion column that recent years have seen \"the emergence of a very committed and powerful anti-Israel lobby in Washington.\" However, critics of Israel's policies often object to the phrase “anti-Israel” being used in regards to such lobbying. Historian Paul Charles Merkley wrote in his 2001 book, \"Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel\", that the American Friends of the Middle East, which was founded in 1951, \"remains an active anti-Israeli lobby.\" Martin J. Raffel identified the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) as being part of \"The Anti-Israel lobby\", hostile to the Jewish-American community in the late 1980s.

In 2008, University of Florida political scientist Ken Wald warned that the left leaning pro-Israel lobby group J Street \"will get hammered and accused of being anti-Israel\" by \"more conservative pro-Israeli factions.\" The founder of J Street responded to such criticism of being \"anti-Israel\" saying that \"the most pro-Israel thing any American politician or policy maker can do is help to bring about a two-state solution and a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and her neighbours.\" Barack Obama, during the 2008 election campaign, implicitly noted differences within the lobby in his comment that \"there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says, 'unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel, that you’re anti-Israel,' and that can’t be the measure of our friendship with Israel.\" \"Commentary\" magazine notes: \"It was an odd choice of words—Likud has not been Israel’s governing party for more than three years—but what Obama clearly meant was that an American politician should not have to express fealty to the most hard-line ideas relating to Israel's security to be considered a supporter of Israel's.\""], "neg": ["Pakistani lobby in the United States\nPakistani lobby in the United States The Pakistan lobby in the United States refers to the professional lobbyists paid directly by the government of Pakistan to lobby the public and government of the United States on behalf of Pakistani interests and/or on behalf of Pakistani American rights and interests. Stephen Payne is believed to be the preeminent paid lobbyist for the government of Pakistan in the U.S. According to former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, Payne played a pivotal role in U.S.-Pakistan relations, serving as Pakistan's lobbyist through a group called Team Eagle (also known as Team Barakat). Payne worked as a lobbyist for Pakistan to deliver a multibillion dollar U.S. aid package and to remove U.S. economic and military sanctions against Pakistan that had been in place for several years. He also helped Pakistan secure Major non-NATO ally status, which Pakistan received in 2004 as well as helping to secure F-16s, C-130s and military helicopters for Pakistan. Pakistan has paid lobbyists to obtain “Reconstruction Opportunity Zones,” industrial development zones with the privilege of exporting goods manufactured in Pakistan duty-free to the United States and to maintain high levels of U.S. foreign aid. Pakistan has sought to furthen its foreign policy interests in the United States through lobbying. In one particular incident on March 1997, the member of the House of Representatives from Indiana Dan Burton was accused of demanding a $5,000 contribution from a Pakistani lobbyist.

{"query": "Russell-Einstein Manifesto impact on global peace movements beyond Pugwash Conferences", "pos": ["Russell–Einstein Manifesto\nRussell–Einstein Manifesto The Russell–Einstein Manifesto was issued in London on 9 July 1955 by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War. It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on 18 April 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist Cyrus S. Eaton offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957. The first detonation of an atomic weapon took place on 16 July 1945 in the desert north of Alamogordo, New Mexico. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped \"Little Boy\" on the Japanese city of Hiroshima and, three days later, \"Fat Man\" on Nagasaki. At least 100,000 civilians were killed outright by these two bombings. On 18 August 1945, the \"Glasgow Forward\" published \"The Bomb and Civilisation,\" the first known recorded comment by Bertrand Russell on atomic weapons, which he began composing the day Nagasaki was bombed. It contained threads that would later appear in the manifesto: After learning of the bombing of Hiroshima and seeing an impending nuclear arms race, Joseph Rotblat, the only scientist to leave the Manhattan Project on moral grounds, remarked that he \"became worried about the whole future of mankind\". Over the years that followed Russell and Rotblat worked on efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, collaborating with Albert Einstein and other scientists to compose what became known as the Russell–Einstein Manifesto. The manifesto was released during a press conference at Caxton Hall, London. Rotblat, who chaired the meeting, describes it as follows: Russell had begun the conference by stating: The manifesto called for a conference where scientists would assess the dangers posed to the survival of humanity by weapons of mass destruction. Emphasis was placed on the meeting being politically neutral. It extended the question of nuclear weapons to all people and governments. One particular phrase is quoted often, including by Rotblat upon receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995: The manifesto called for an international conference, and was originally planned by Jawaharlal Nehru to be held in India. This was delayed by the outbreak of the Suez Crisis. Aristotle Onassis offered to finance a meeting in Monaco, but this was rejected. Instead, Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian industrialist who had known Russell since 1938, offered to finance the conference in his hometown of Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The Russell–Einstein Manifesto became the Pugwash Conferences' founding charter. The first of the conferences was held in July 1957 in London.

Many in the academic and faith communities, however, felt that such a negative image of religion was detrimental to the future of humanity because religion is a major force in human affairs which can be harnessed for either good or evil. Many members of these communities also felt that associating religion exclusively with evil was not only historically inaccurate, it also deprived humanity of a major source of promoting well-being. A series of conferences was therefore organized to, The motto of the first global conference which met September 11–15, 2006, and was inaugurated by the Iranian Peace laureate Madam Shirin Ebadi was: \"Can religion be a force for good?\" The second global conference met on September 4, 2011. It was inaugurated by Nobel Peace laureate the Dalai Lama with the motto: \"Peace through religion.\" The third conference met on September 15, 2016, at the Palais des Congrès in Montreal, Canada. The motto of this conference was: From Faith to Interfaith.\" The theme which unifies all these conferences is that of evolving a Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the World's Religions, a project which was launched in Montreal in 1998 on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. The relationship of the religions of the world and human rights has been a much debated issue ever since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948 by the United Nations. Two basic approaches to this relationship are prominent. According to one, religions have a negative relationship to human rights inasmuch as human rights discourse provides a norm in the light of which the doctrines and practices of the world's religions could be judged. Such an attempt reveals that religions often fall short of meeting human rights norms and therefore the relationship of religion to human rights acquires a negative aspect. Another view takes a somewhat opposite position. According to it, the religions of the world played a major role in the very formulation of human rights and can offer fresh perspectives on ways to secure human flourishing, which is the obvious goal of human rights discourse. This more positive approach to the relationship between religion and human rights is evident in the various documents on human rights produced by the religions of the world, some of which are enumerated below. All these and similar declarations engage the issue of religion and human rights but from the perspective of only a \"single\" religious tradition, just as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and so on. What is unique about the three conferences mentioned above is the fact that they represent a progressive effort to formulate a joint response from the world's religions to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by way of formulating a Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the World's Religions, a project which has the support of five Nobel Peace laureates who are its patrons: the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Madam Shirin Ebadi, Bishop Belo of Timor Leste, and Professor Elie Wiesel."]}
{"query": "National Audit Office audit reports on government spending beyond Better Care Fund effectiveness", "pos": ["National Audit Office (United Kingdom)\nNational Audit Office (United Kingdom) The National Audit Office (NAO) is an independent Parliamentary body in the United Kingdom which is responsible for auditing central government departments, government agencies and non-departmental public bodies. The NAO also carries out Value for Money (VFM) audit into the administration of public policy. The NAO is the auditor of bodies funded directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The NAO reports to the Comptroller and Auditor General who is an officer of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and in turn reports to the Public Accounts Committee, a select committee of the House of Commons. The reports produced by the NAO are reviewed by PAC and in some cases investigated further. The NAO has two main streams of work: Financial Audits and Value For Money (VFM) audits. The NAO’s financial audits give assurance over three aspects of government expenditure: the truth and fairness of financial statements; the regularity (or statutory validity) of the expenditure, and; the propriety of the audited body’s conduct in accordance with parliamentary, statutory and public expectations. Financial audits are carried out in much the same way as private auditing bodies and the NAO voluntarily applies the International Standards of Auditing (ISAs). The NAO is subject to inspection by the Audit Quality Review team of the Financial Reporting Council. Value for Money (VFM) audits are non-financial audits to measure the effectiveness, economy and efficiency of government spending. Roughly sixty of these reports are produced each year, the most notable from recent years being the reports on MRSA, which led to an increase in public interest in the topic, the report on the rescue of British Energy and the report in the Public Private Partnership to maintain the London Underground. The remits of the NAO and the Public Accounts Committee do not allow them to question the policy itself and so VFM reports only examine the implementation of policy. The responsibility for questioning policy is left for other select committees and debating chambers of Parliament, but this has not prevented the PAC being named committee of the year in 2006. \"Good Governance\", an output somewhere between financial and VFM audits, was previously a strand of NAO work, but is no longer a focus of activity. The NAO does, however, publish best practice guidance for public sector organisations. An example includes the fact sheet on governance statements. In addition, the NAO undertakes fast-paced and more narrowly focused work called investigations. The NAO received new powers under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 to provide an end-to-end view of policy implementation, and produce reports aimed at the local government sector. The Comptroller Function is administered by the small, but important, Exchequer Section within the NAO. Its work centres on recording all transactions to and from the Consolidated and National Loans funds. Money cannot be paid from either of these without the C&AG's prior approval. This approval is granted every banking day through a mechanism known as 'the credit'. The Exchequer Section is also responsible for agreeing payments from the Consolidated Fund directly to certain bodies, including the Queen (through the civil list), judicial salaries, MEPs salaries and the European Commission. The NAO produces a number of briefings for select committees, but its key audience is the Public Accounts Committee. It also has a strong relationship with the Public Accounts Commission that oversees the work of the NAO and approves its budgets. The NAO and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) form the key links of the Public Audit Circle which has the following sequence: The Public Accounts Commission (TPAC) annually approves the NAO's corporate plans and budgets. It also receives value for money reports on the operation of the NAO. These are written by private sector audit firms in much the same manner as the NAO reports on Central Government. The National Audit Office is a member of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The NAO shares knowledge and experience with other Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) around the world and undertakes the audit of some international bodies. For example, between 2010–2016 the C&AG was one of three members of the United Nations Board of Auditors, responsible for auditing the United Nations itself, including peacekeeping operations and related organisations such as UNICEF and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The earliest known mention of a public official responsible for auditing government expenditure is a reference made in 1314 to the \"Auditor of the Exchequer\".  In 1559 an office was set up, with responsibility for auditing Exchequer payments, called the Auditors of the Imprest.  In 1785 a \"Commission for Auditing the Public Accounts\" was established by statute (the former arrangement having fallen into abeyance). Its members, the Commissioners of Audit, were five in number (increased to ten in 1806). The Commissioners worked closely with the Comptroller of the Exchequer (who was charged with controlling the issue of funds to the government) following the establishment of that office in 1834.  Under the terms of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, the offices of the Comptroller of the Exchequer and the Commissioners of Audit were merged and their duties vested in a new official: the Comptroller and Auditor General (formally the \"Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty's Exchequer and Auditor General of Public Accounts\"). The NAO developed from the former Exchequer and Audit Department (founded in 1866) in 1983 as the auditor for central government (including most of the externalised agencies and public bodies) as part of an \"appropriate mechanism\" to check and reinforce departmental balance and matching of quantitative allocation with qualitative purpose (as set out by public policy). The existence and work of the NAO are underpinned by three fundamental principles of public audit:  The basic need for the NAO arises from these three fundamental principles, in that, as Parliament votes on public expenditure of various activities by public bodies, they need auditors that are independent of the body in question, the government and/or opposing political parties; while auditing for compliance and legal spending by departments on the activities voted for by Parliament, in a transparent and public forum. The NAO is based in London and Newcastle and has a staff of 800. The NAO is structured into Directorates, each with a responsibility for a government department (for instance, the Home Office or Department for Culture, Media and Sport). Each Directorate contains 20–30 staff, many of whom are qualified accountants or in training for qualification with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). Within Directorates, staff will be split between Financial Audit and Value for Money work and include staff of the following grades:  Directorates are arranged into clusters of government departments of similar characteristics. This enables the NAO to undertake comparative work between departments. Above director grade, Directors General have responsibility for specific cross NAO functions (such as Audit Practice and Quality, and Finance and Commerce) and Executive Leaders (previously \"Assistant Auditors General\") support the Board. The NAO has finance, human resource and ICT functions to support its operations. Part of the NAO's London Office is a listed building, originally built for Imperial Airways as their \"\"Empire Terminal\"\". The building underwent a £60m restoration and refurbishment, completed in 2009. The NAO rents part of its offices to tenants, generating income of c£1.3mn in 2012–13 The building is a modern, open plan office and the refurbishment enabled the NAO to introduce many environmentally friendly features, such as rain-water harvesting. The NAO has a separate office in Newcastle employing c90 staff. Following the controversy over a previous C&AG’s expenses —see the criticisms— the governance arrangements of the NAO were overhauled and a Board was put in place to oversee the running of the organisation. The Board is made up of  Some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the NAO include the following: There are several other public sector auditing bodies in the United Kingdom:"], "neg": ["National Commission of Audit\nNational Commission of Audit The National Commission of Audit was a commission formed by the Abbott Government on 22 October 2013 as an independent body to review and report on the performance, functions and roles of the Commonwealth government. The chair of the Commission was Tony Shepherd AO who is a former head of the Business Council of Australia. The other Commissioners were Peter Boxall AO, Tony Cole AO, Robert Fisher AM and Amanda Vanstone. The Terms of Reference for the Commission was to make recommendations to return the budget to a sustainable surplus of 1% of GDP by 2023/24. The Commission was not asked to examine the revenue side of the budget, though it looked at some revenue issues. The Commission's report was the first full scale review of government expenditures for 18 years. The Commission Report was titled \"Towards Responsible Government\" and published in two parts. Phase One Report, published in February 2014, dealt predominantly with improving the sustainability of finances, and Phase Two Report, published in March 2014, mostly addressed public sector performance and accountability as well as infrastructure. The Commission made 86 recommendations – 64 in its Phase One Report and 22 recommendations in its Phase Two Report. Among the recommendations, the report recommended a slowing of the increases in the age pension to 28% of the average weekly earnings, an increase in the retirement age to 70 by 2035 and the inclusion of the family home in new means testing from 2027. These Commission's recommendations were adopted in the budget. The Commission also recommended changes to the bulk billing arrangements under Medicare, by the introduction of a compulsory copayment regime. The recommendation was accepted by the Abbott Government in the 2014 Australian federal budget, though the proposed budget measure deviated from the committee's recommendation in the copayment being linked to funding for a medical research fund. The budget measure has been widely criticised. The Commission found that the vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalance in Australia is a major impediment to growth and prosperity and recommended that the States have direct access to a portion of income tax generated in their economy and this be offset by a reduction in tied grants. It also recommended a pro rata distribution of GST with top ups to the supported States. The Commission reviewed and recommended rationalisation of many of the 900 Commonwealth bodies. Similarly on grants programs, it recommended far tighter controls and monitoring and assessment of outcomes. The Commission calculates that its recommendations would generate savings estimated at $60 to $70 billion per year within ten years, as well as a significant annual saving in interest arising from a reduction of debt. The National Commission of Audit ceased on 31 March 2014. Treasurer Joe Hockey quickly emphasised that the report is \"not the budget\" but has not ruled out adopting any of the proposals."]}

The city is mostly located in Gregg County, of which it is the county seat; a small part of Longview extends into the western part of neighboring Harrison County. Longview is located in East Texas, where Interstate 20 and U.S. Highways 80 and 259 converge just north of the Sabine River. According to the 2010 U.S. census, the city had a population of 80,455. The estimated population in 2017 was 81,522. Longview is the principal city of the Longview metropolitan statistical area, comprising Gregg, Upshur, and Rusk counties. The population of the metropolitan area as of 2017 census estimates is 217,481. Longview was established in the 1870s and became a railroad route in East Texas; the city was also the first incorporated town in Gregg County. Today, Longview is considered a major hub city for the region, as is the nearby city of Tyler. In 2014, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Longview as the sixth fastest-growing small city in the United States. Companies with significant presence in Longview are Eastman Chemical and Trinity Rail Group; communities stimulating the city and metro area are LeTourneau University, Kilgore College, and the University of Texas at Tyler's Longview University Center. Longview was founded in the 1870s by Ossamus Hitch Methvin, Sr. In 1870, Methvin sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad for one dollar to persuade them to build their line in the direction of land he owned. Later that year, he sold another for $500 in gold. He hoped the coming of the railroad would increase the value of the rest of his land. Methvin coined the name of the town when he stated, \"What a long view!\" from his home. In June 1871, Longview was incorporated as the first town in Gregg County. In 1884 the elite Mobberly Hotel opened for business servicing the railroad travelers and served as the center of social gatherings for Longview. The hotel featured cherry wood furniture with carved bed posters, marble top wash stands, linen table cloths, electric crystal chandeliers and a fireplace in every room. Mobberly was located in the junction part of town near the train depot. The hotel was destroyed by fire on June 13, 1965. In July 1919, a reporter for \"The Chicago Defender\" was in Longview looking into the mysterious death of a black man named Lemuel Walters. An armed white mob attacked a home where the reporter, S.L. Jones, was staying and attempted to batter their way in. A gunfight began between the attackers and the men in the house. Eventually, Jones made a getaway. The white men then began to burn buildings in the black section of the town. In 1942, construction began on the Big Inch pipeline in Longview. From 1943 to 1945, the pipeline transported over 261,000,000 barrels of crude oil to the East Coast. At the time of construction, Big Inch and its smaller twin, Little Inch, comprised the longest petroleum pipeline ever built in the world. Both were integral in supplying the United States war effort in World War II. After World War II Longview's population grew from 24,502 to 40,050 in 1960, its growth fueled by migration from rural Gregg County and the annexation of Greggton and Spring Hill. Longview is located at (32.509147, -94.753909).

Despite a national downturn in the housing market, Longview has been growing, and home prices continue to rise. Some major sectors of the Longview economy include the East Texas Oil Field, services, technology, and manufacturing. In 2007, Longview added some major chain stores to its north side. The addition of Kohl's, two Starbucks, a new Target, a third Walmart supercenter on the south side, and a handful of hotels means Longview is becoming a regional hub for shopping. Keeping shoppers in Longview and away from Tyler, Dallas, and Shreveport has been an important strategy for the city. Most new construction has been located on the north side around Hawkins Pkwy. and US 259, with lesser development on the south side near Estes Pkwy. In October 2007, Longview was recertified as a Texas Urban Main Street City. There are 89 cities in the Texas Main Street Program, 10 of them are Urban Main Street Cities. In December 2007, Longview was awarded the \"Certified Retirement Community\" designation by the Texas Department of Agriculture through its \"Go Texan\" initiative. Longview was also included in 2007 in the \"Top 100 Best Cities for Young People.\" Longview is one of several cities in East Texas that serves as a center for the \"patent troll\" industry, due to a perception that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas is a favorable venue for patent infringement plaintiffs. According to the municipal 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are: According to the its most recent Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the city's various funds had $75.9 million in revenues, $87.7 million in expenditures, $47.6 million in total assets, $9.0 million in total liabilities, and $12.2 million in cash in investments.

Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the Longview station serves the Chicago to Los Angeles trains. The return train, Los Angeles to Chicago, stops in Longview on Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday. It serves about 20–50 passengers per day. From the station, passengers can connect to Nacogdoches, Houston, and Galveston, as well as Shreveport, Louisiana, by motorcoach. A proposal is in the works for a high-speed rail system from Dallas/Fort Worth to Shreveport along the I-20 corridor. Longview is served by two freight railroad lines. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad operates two trains daily through Longview. The Union Pacific Railroad has 25 daily trains through Longview's facilities. The Longview Economic Development Corporation website provides more details about the transportation infrastructure, including air, rail, trucking, waterways, and highway information. Many maps are also available. One Interstate freeway and two U.S. highways run through Longview. Four Texas state highways also run into Longview. Two Texas state highway spurs serve to connect highways in Longview.  Longview is accessed easily by I-20, which passes south of the city center. New construction has prompted some major upgrades to the city's system of roads. Medians have been added to Loop 281 as Phase I of the project is nearing completion. Phase II of the project will upgrade the road to a six-lane parkway. Slated to start in 2009, TxDOT has informed Longview officials that the funds have been withdrawn, placing Phase II on indefinite hold. TxDOT is researching an outer loop around the north side of Longview to complete the East Texas Hourglass. The road will loop around Longview and Tyler and is slated to start in 2012. The new Interstate 69 will be passing just east of the Longview area between Longview and Marshall, near or over the current US 59 highway. The Gregg County (the vast majority) portion of Longview are part of the Tyler-Longview-Lufkin-Nacogdoches Designated Market Area, DMA #110.

It is the principal city of the \"Longview, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area\", which encompasses all of Cowlitz County. Longview's population was 36,648 at the time of the 2010 census and it is the largest city in Cowlitz County. The city is located in southwestern Washington, at the junction of the Cowlitz and Columbia rivers. Longview shares a border with Kelso to the east, which is the county seat. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe, a federally recognized tribe of Cowlitz people, is headquartered in Longview. The Long-Bell Lumber Company, led by Robert A. Long, decided in 1918 to buy a great expanse of timberland in Cowlitz County. A total of 14,000 workers were needed to run the two large mills as well as lumber camps that were planned. The number of workers needed was more than a lumber town, or the nearest town, could provide. Long planned and built a complete city in 1921 that could support a population of up to 50,000 and provide labor for the mills as well as attracting other industries. Several buildings in the city were built from Long's private funds. Longview was the location of Mount Coffin, an ancestral burial ground for the local indigenous people. The Longview area was first settled by European-Americans, led by pioneers Harry and Rebecca Jane Huntington, in 1849. The area was named Monticello in honor of Thomas Jefferson's home in Virginia. In 1852 a group assembled in what would be called the \"Monticello Convention\" to petition Congress for statehood to be called \"Columbia\". Congress agreed to statehood but as Washington, after President Washington, to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia. A monument to the convention is located near the Longview Civic Center. The area remained sparsely populated for nearly 60 years, consisting mostly of farmland and wilderness. In 1918, Missouri timber baron Robert A. Long (1850–1934) decided to move his operation out to the west coast, owing to the Long-Bell Lumber Company's dwindling supplies in the south. By 1921, Wesley Vandercook had decided to build a mill near the small town of Kelso, Washington. It was apparent that Kelso, with a population of barely 2,000 would not be able to support the approximately 14,000 men that would be required to run the mill. The Long-Bell company contracted with George Kessler, a city planner based in St. Louis, to build the city that would support the two mills that were now planned.  Kessler designed a masterpiece based on the nations capital, with elements of Roman City planning. It’s theme is rooted in the City Beautiful movement, which influenced urban Design in the early 20th century. Longview was officially incorporated on February 14, 1924. At the time of its conception, Longview was the only planned city of its magnitude to have ever been conceived of and built entirely with private funds. A number of prominent buildings in Longview were purchased with R. A. Long's personal funds, including R. A. Long High School, the Longview Public Library, the YMCA building and the Monticello Hotel. The initial growth period, lasting from 1923 to 1934, were very rapid. The city grew from a few thousand people to bring the fourth largest city in the state by the 1930s. However, the effects of the Great Depression hampered further development of the planned city until the booming war economy, where the Port of Longview became a strategic location for cargo loading going into the Pacific Theater.  Suburban developments created neighborhoods in the western valley in the 1960s. The local economy has been in decline since environmental policies took effect in the 1970s and 80s, causing the decline of the community. No major development occurred until a brief boom in the early 2000s, ended by the Recession.  Recently, initiative from local activists have pushed to implement a new strategic plan to increase development in the city, in an effort to expand affordable housing. Longview has many historic and beautiful buildings, most of which were built in the initial growth period from 1923-1934, prior to the worst effects of the Great Depression. Ranging from Georgian-revival style with the major public buildings, Tudor and craftsman style homes, commercial vernacular, and Art Deco, there are many contributing properties.  A park, a bridge, and many buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the Civic Center, that is a National Register Historic District. The city has seven council members with one serving as the mayor as well as a city manager. The city council elects a mayor out of themselves every two years. The mayor runs the council meetings, and serves as the ceremonial figure head of the city. Day to day operations are conducted by the city Manager, which is hired by the city council. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The Lewis and Clark Bridge spans the Columbia River, linking Longview to Rainier, Oregon. It is the only bridge spanning the river between Portland and Astoria, Oregon. Longview is located in a small gorge, so its climate varies from that of its close neighbor, Portland. Longview is generally about cooler than Portland. Located about inland across a stretch of relatively flat ground, the Longview skies can be overcast due to moisture from the Pacific Coast marine layer. The Columbia River gorge permits an exchange of air between eastern and western Washington. The direction and speed of air movement through the gorge is determined primarily by the pressure gradient between the eastern and western slopes of the mountains. Due to the gorge-like effect, marine pushes on summer evenings can frequently reach gusts up to There have been gusts of up to , and over at higher elevations. Fall is usually cooler but foggy; on some days the fog never clears. By early-to-mid November, rainfall begins in typical Northwest fashion. Winter tends to be chilly and rainy, with occasional violent windstorms or spates of unusually warm——temperatures. This is due to extremely warm air coming from the Pineapple Express which can drop of rain in a matter of days. Each year there are one or two snowfalls, typically less than but up to in the surrounding foothills. Spring is warmer, but still a little wet; this is the most common time for the occasional thunderstorms.

Ryan was born in Chicago, Illinois and earned a B.A. from the University of Utah in 1951, where he was a 1950 initiate of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. He earned master's and Ph.D. degrees from Indiana University in 1958 and 1959, respectively. While in graduate school, Ryan served in two professional roles: first as a research analyst in the Kentucky Department of Revenue, then in establishing the graduate public administration program at Thammasat University. After graduating, he taught political science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1962, he became executive assistant to the president of the University of Massachusetts Amherst before moving to Arizona State University at Tempe to assume the vice presidency for academic affairs. He returned East to serve as the first chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Boston from 1965 to 1968. In July 1968, Ryan returned to Indiana University to become vice president for regional campuses and became its fourteenth president on January 26, 1971. His 16 years of service to the university saw the establishment of two new IU campuses in New Albany (Indiana University Southeast) and in Richmond (Indiana University East), the formation of various cultural centers on the Bloomington campus, and the creation of the School of Journalism, the School of Continuing Studies, the School of Optometry, and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Ryan retired in 1987 and was immediately appointed President Emeritus of Indiana University. He remained an active figure within the university, both as a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and as a member of several boards and committees. In one of his first official acts, Ryan hired legendary men's basketball coach Bob Knight on behalf of the IU Board of Trustees in 1971. On September 4, 2009, John Ryan was awarded the University Medal, IU's highest nonacademic award. According to an IU press release, \"The University Medal honors individuals for singular or noteworthy contributions, including service to the university and achievement in arts, letters, science and law. It is the only medal that requires approval by the IU Board of Trustees.

{"query": "BBC Weather Centre technological advancements beyond presenter roles\")\n```", "pos": ["BBC Weather\nBBC Weather BBC Weather is the BBC's department for the preparation and broadcasting of their weather forecasts. The information is provided by MeteoGroup. Previously, the Met Office had been the BBC's provider of weather services for 94 years up to 2017. The first BBC weather forecast was a shipping forecast, broadcast on the radio on behalf of the Met Office on 14 November 1922, and the first daily weather forecast was broadcast on 26 March 1923. In 1936, the BBC experimented with the world's first televised weather maps, which was brought into practice in 1949 after World War II. The map filled the entire screen, with an off-screen announcer reading the next day's weather. On 11 January 1954, the first in-vision weather forecast was broadcast, presented by George Cowling. In an in-vision the narrator stands in front of the map. At that point, the maps were drawn by hand in the London Weather Centre, before being couriered across London. The forecasts were presented by the same person who had composed them, and had relatively low accuracy. The London Weather Centre which opened in 1959 took the responsibility for the national radio weather broadcasts. Radio forecasters were chosen by a BBC audition from the forecasters at the London Weather Centre. In 1962, the installation of a fax machine and an electronic computer in the Met Office led to more accurate and quicker forecasting. Satellite photography was available from 1964, but was of a poor quality and was given on paper, with the coastline etched in felt-tip pen. This did not change until 1973 with the installation of a new computer, increasing processing power of the Weather Centre greatly, leading to forecasts twice as accurate as earlier ones. As computational capability improved, so did graphics technology. Early hand-drawn maps gave way to magnetic symbols, which in turn gave way to bluescreen (CSO) computer-generated imagery technology, each of which allowed the presenter greater control over the information displayed. Early magnetic symbols tended to adhere poorly to the maps, and occasional spelling errors (such as the presenter writing 'GOF' instead of 'FOG') marred some broadcasts, but allowed the presenter to show how weather would change over time. The symbols were designed to be 'self-explicit', allowing the viewer to understand the map without a key or legend. These were phased out in 1985 for computer graphics, although the basic design of symbols was kept the same. These forecasts were widely acclaimed for their simplicity, winning an award from the Royal Television Society in 1993. On 2 October 2000, BBC Weather underwent a more significant change. Whilst there was not much change to the existing weather symbols new symbols giving information on pollen and sun levels were introduced. A new more detailed map of Britain was used based on satellite data. Possibly, the most famous of the forecasters is the now semi-retired Michael Fish. Famous for his informal manner and eccentric dress sense (he once wore a blue and green blazer emblazoned with all the weather symbols), he was a viewer favourite despite an unfortunate comment before the Great Storm of 1987. During a weather forecast some hours before the storm, Michael Fish started his forecast with the now infamous line \"Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't\". Although he was factually correct, as it is impossible for a proper hurricane to reach the UK latitudes, and he was actually referring to a Florida hurricane (Floyd), and he went on to accurately forecast stormy conditions over the south of England, the statement has gone down in popular culture as one of the worst mistakes made so publicly. The weather symbols were replaced in May 2005 after 29 years and 9 months on air by a controversial format as the forecast underwent another redesign, with the flat map replaced by a 3D globe, and weather conditions shown by coloured areas. Cloud cover is indicated by the brightness of the map, while rain and snow are indicated by animated blue and white areas respectively. The graphics are provided by Weatherscape XT, which was developed by the commercial arm of the New Zealand Metservice. The move polarised opinion; some saw it as more accurate and modern, while others disliked the brown colour chosen for the landmass and the presumed high cost of the graphics. The angling of the map, in order to show the curvature of the Earth, led to Scotland appearing little larger than Devon, and Shetland being almost invisible while exaggerating London and the South East. This led to many Scottish commentators accusing the BBC of having a London bias. As a result, the map was realigned, and the moving tour of the UK was lengthened. The new look won a prestigious Silver Award at the Promax/BDA Awards in 2006. Criticism has continued, however, with some viewers complaining about the colour scheme, and of a lack of detail in the forecast about weather developments beyond 36 hours. There have been continuous developments. In 2006, a rippling effect was introduced to define seas and oceans. On 23 August 2015, the BBC announced that the Met Office would lose its contract to provide weather forecasts, the BBC stating that it is legally obliged to ensure that licence fee payers get the best value for money. The BBC said that the on-air presenting team was not expected to change and it would still broadcast warnings from the Met Office National Severe Weather Warning Service and Shipping Forecast issued on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. A competitive tendering process followed, with MeteoGroup chosen as the new provider in August 2016. Public feedback in January 2018 regarding the subsequent updates and changes to the BBC Website and associated weather applications for mobile devices were generally critical.  On 6 February 2018, the BBC began using the MeteoGroup graphics. The redesign includes: Many weather watchers were highly critical of the new design, with widespread criticism voiced across the media. Many used the comments section of the blog written by Michael Burnett, the BBC Executive responsible to voice their complaints. The blog entry dated 22 January 2018 was originally aimed at positively promoting the changes, but this appeared to have the opposite effect when the blog post generated well over 1000 mostly critical comments in under 10 days include references to the changes as \"the opposite of improvements\", \"utterly laughable\", \"completely cluttered and confusing\" as well as \"woefully inaccurate\". In response, the BBC appears to have removed the links to Michael Burnetts blog from both the main BBC homepage and the BBC weather homepage, a move that was also criticised openly among many of those commenting. National forecasters still provide forecasts for local news programmes. The BBC Weather website provides outlook weather forecasts for UK and international locations using animated symbols and a format similar in design to that used for the televised broadcasts. The website launched in 1997. The website also runs frequent special features about seasonal sports, white Christmas, nature, and meteorological science. It also has world weather, UK outlook, and weather news.

{"query": "Moudi-shini deity origin myths and worship rituals beyond student blessings\") \n```", "pos": ["Sinitic religion\nSinitic religion Sinitic religion or Siniticism is the religion of the Chinese civilisation. It has its sources in the Neolithic and has developed throughout history into a coherent multiplex system which persists up to the present day, and consists of indigenous and popular devotional cults, popular soteriological organisations, vernacular ritual methods, shamanic methods, state ritual systems, and schools of high philosophy and ritual (chiefly distinguished into Confucianism and Taoism). According to the definition given by Hu Shih, Sinitic religion was the product of the merger of Shang and Zhou cultures, and \"has been to China what Hinduism has been to India\". The Shang contributed with a strong devotion to ancestors, while the Zhou who came from the west emphasised a theology of the supreme God (\"Shangdi\" or \"Tian\", cf. Chinese theology). The result is a living cosmology with the supreme God as its spring, presiding over a hierarchy of mediating forces, namely the gods of cosmic and natural powers, the deified ancestors of great achievement, the progenitors of human groups. Also tribal gods of populations who were assimilated into China were integrated into this cosmology. While always retaining its primary core, it has taken onto itself philosophical elements from Buddhism. The most ancient book of the Sinitic religious system is the \"Yijing\". Victor H. Mair similarly describes Sinitic religion as built upon two foundations: The developments of organised religious systems from the medieval to the early modern periods did not alter this nucleus, although contributed to a continuous change of architecture, music, literature and institutions. Ho (1998) describes Sinitic religion as \"man-centred\" with \"ancestor worship at its core\". The worship of local gods and forces of nature, and kinship progenitors, was defined as \"Shendao\" (神道 \"Shéndào\", the \"Way of the Gods\") by 14th century Hongwu Emperor of the Ming, drawing from the \"Yijing\" in which the term refers to the natural order established by deities. It is the \"hardware\" upon which philosophical and ritual traditions such as Confucianism and Taoism build. Recent scholarship has proposed the name \"Shenxianism\" (神仙教 \"Shénxiānjiào\", \"religion of deities and immortals\"). All cults falling outside the scope and patronage of the high institutional forms of Confucianism and Taoism can be defined as \"popular religion\". According to Hu Shih, Confucianism, founded by Confucius, a scion of the erstwhile ruling Shang lineage, is a school of Sinitic religion concerned with setting the world to the right order, a system of education and \"psychology of religious experience\" which regards ritual as the device for this praxis. It is also a religion of \"ancestor worship\" and of \"body as inheritance from the ancestors\", whence the emphasis on personal purity and cultivation. Mohism, which has not had a profound impact compared to Confucianism, was founded by Mozi. According to Hu Shih it is a religion focused on a theology of \"God as love\". Moism ultimately merged with Taoism. Taoism is a tradition of philosophy, rite and ecclesiastical organisation, which emphasises living in harmony with the \"Tao\" (, literally \"Way\", also romanised as \"Dao\"). Taoist schools function as theoretical and liturgical frameworks for both popular and high cults of broader Chinese religion (cf. Zhengyi Taoism), and some of them (the Quanzhen traditions) have a distinct monastic institution. In this tradition the \"Tao\" denotes both the metaphysical source of everything that exist and its physical pattern of unconcealment. Taoism differs specifically from Confucian traditions by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order, which are fundamental in the latter."], "neg": ["Sanjhi\nSanjhi Sanjhi is a festival to the namesake goddess, mainly by women and girls in parts of Delhi, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. Sanjhi is the name of a mother goddess, after whom images are made of mud and molded into various shapes such as cosmic bodies or the face of the goddess, and they get different colors. The local potters make images of various body parts like her arms, legs, face decked with ornaments and weapons. These additions make the image look beautiful and gracious. The additions to the image this way depend upon the economic means of the family.  The image is designed on the first day of the nine days of Durga Puja or Navratri. Every day women from the neighborhood are invited for singing evening psalms and performing aarti. The young girls also gather there and offer their adoration to the mother who is believed to get them suitable husbands. The psalms or the bhajans are chanted daily and some elderly woman guides others. It is usually an all females event. Sanjhi image is prepared on the wall by those families who seek fulfillment of their wishes termed mannat by Punjabis. Some people also seek her blessings for the marriage of their daughters. Kirtan is performed and the image is immersed in water on the last day. The Sanjhi festival ends with the immersion of Sanjhi on the day of Dussehra. The girls offer prayers and food to the goddess every day. As a traditional art of Vraja, Lord Krishna’s homeland, sanjhi is intrinsically linked to the transcendental sports of the divine couple Krishna and Radha, whose play of love is depicted in the sanjhi designs. Vaishnava theology traces the origin of sanjhi to the divine lila itself: sanjhi designs were created by Radha in order to evoke Lord Krishna’s presence. Folk mythology also holds another version of the same lila, according to which it was Lord Krishna who, at evening twilight time, prepared a beautiful image of Radha made of flowers in order to appease her. The early tradition of preparing sanjhis made of cow dung and flowers, which is still practiced in the villages, has been taken up by the Vaishnava temples around the 15th/16th centuries and developed into a highly sophisticated art form practiced by specially trained Brahman priests. The major type of temple sanjhi is prepared from dry colors upon an octagonal earthen platform symbolizing an eight-petalled lotus. The heart (hauda) of the design constitutes the seat of the divine couple, the sanctum sanctorum; from here, an intricate layout of artfully interlocked diagonal patterns enables the expansion of divinity towards the eight directions. The worship of a mystic design as in sanjhi is rooted in early Hinduism and Tantrism, and has obvious parallels in Vajrayana and Mahayana Buddhism. In both cases, song rendered in front of the design constitutes the central element of worship."]}
{"query": "Sonnō jōi movement ideology and broader social impact instead of specific events with Kōno Togama", "pos": ["Sonnō jōi\nSonnō jōi During the Spring and Autumn period of China, Chancellor Guan Zhong of Qi initiated a policy called \"Revere the king, expel the barbarians\" (). Adopting and adhering to it, Duke Huan of Qi assembled the Chinese feudal lords to strike down the threat of barbarians from China. For it, Confucius himself praised Guan Zhong for the preservation of Chinese civilization through the example of the contrast in the hairstyles and clothing styles between the Zhou and the barbarians, which came to be known as the Hua–Yi distinction. In addition, the author of Gongyang Zhuan, Gongyang Gao praised Duke Huan of Qi for saving central plain states from Chu's expansion. The Hua-Yi distinction in this case was the duel between Qi and Chu. Through the \"Analects\" and Gongyang Zhuan the Chinese expression came to be transmitted to Japan as \"sonnō jōi\". The origin of the philosophy as used in Japan can be traced to works by 17th century Confucian scholars Yamazaki Ansai and Yamaga Sokō, who wrote on the sanctity of the Imperial House of Japan and its superiority to the ruling houses of other nations. These ideas were expanded by Kokugaku scholar Motoori Norinaga, and seen in Takenouchi Shikibu's theory of absolute loyalty to the Emperor of Japan ( \"sonnōron\"), that implied that less loyalty should be given to the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. Mitogaku scholar Aizawa Seishisai introduced the term \"sonnō jōi\" into modern Japanese in his work \"Shinron\" in 1825, where \"sonnō\" was regarded as the reverence expressed by the Tokugawa Shogunate to the emperor and \"jōi\" was the proscription of Christianity. With the increasing number of incursions of foreign ships into Japanese waters in the late 18th and early 19th century, the \"sakoku\" (\"national seclusion\") policy came increasingly into question. The \"jōi\" \"expel the barbarians\" portion of \"sonnō jōi\", changed into a reaction against the Convention of Kanagawa of 1854, which opened Japan to foreign trade. Under military threat from Commodore Matthew C. Perry's so-called \"black ships\", the treaty was signed under duress and was vehemently opposed in \"samurai\" quarters. The fact that the Tokugawa Shogunate was powerless against the foreigners despite the will expressed by the Imperial court was taken as evidence by Yoshida Shōin and other anti-Tokugawa leaders that the \"sonnō\" (revere the Emperor) portion of the philosophy was not working, and that the Shogunate must be replaced by a government more able to show its loyalty to the Emperor by enforcing the Emperor’s will. The philosophy was thus adopted as a battle cry of the rebellious regions of Chōshū Domain and Satsuma Province. The Imperial court in Kyoto sympathized with the movement. Emperor Kōmei personally agreed with such sentiments, and – breaking with centuries of imperial tradition – personally began to take an active role in matters of state: as opportunities arose, he fulminated against the treaties and attempted to interfere in the shogunal succession. His efforts culminated in March 1863 with his \"Order to Expel Barbarians\" (). Although the Shogunate had no intention of enforcing the order, it nevertheless inspired attacks against the Shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan, the most famous incident being the killing of the English trader Charles Lennox Richardson. Other attacks included the shelling of foreign shipping in Shimonoseki. \"Rōnins\" (masterless samurai) also rallied to the cause, assassinating Shogunate officials and Westerners. This turned out to be the zenith of the \"sonnō jōi\" movement, since the European powers responded by demanding heavy war reparations, followed by the British bombardment of Kagoshima when these were not forthcoming. While this incident showed that Japan was no match for Western military powers, it also served to further weaken the Shogunate, permitting the rebel provinces to ally and overthrow it, bringing about the Meiji Restoration. The slogan itself was never actually a government or rebel policy; for all its rhetoric, Satsuma in particular had close ties with the West, purchasing guns, artillery, ships and other technology. After the symbolic restoration of Emperor Meiji, the \"sonnō jōi\" slogan was replaced with \"fukoku kyōhei\" (), or \"enrich the nation, strengthen the armies\", the rallying call of the Meiji period and the seed of its actions during World War II."], "neg": ["Sunao Tokunaga\nSunao Tokunaga Sunao Tokunaga (徳永 直; 1899–1958) was a Japanese proletarian writer. Sunao Tokunaga was born on January 20, 1899, in Kumamoto Prefecture. He was one of first writers of the Japanese proletarian literature movement of the 1920s to come from a truly lower-class background. He dropped out of elementary school, and at the age of twelve became a printer's apprentice. In 1922, he began working for the Hakubunkan Press (博文館印刷所 \"Hakubunkan-insatsusho\"), later renamed to the Kyōdō Press (共同印刷所 \"Kyōdō-insatsusho\"). He took part in union activities while actively writing. The union restricted his literary actities and extracted a promise from him that he would not write any novels. In 1926, he joined some 3,000 Kyōdō employees in striking. After more than two months, the union was completely defeated, and 1,700 employees, including Tokunaga, were fired. This experience provided inspiration for his most important novel, \"Taiyō no nai Machi\" (太陽のない街, \"The Street without Sunlight\"), which he began in 1928. He eventually found another printing job at a large company, and while working there began his literary career. He joined the Japan Proletarian Writers' League (日本プロレタリア作家同盟 \"Nihon Puroretaria Sakka Dōmei\", also abbreviated \"NALP\") in February 1929. In March 1932, Tokunaga wrote an article expressing a desire for a popular literature that the proletariat could enjoy, which inspired a sharp critical response from Takiji Kobayashi, accusing Tokunaga of \"right-wing, opportunistic tendencies\". In May of the same year several members of NALP, including Tokunaga, were rounded up for questioning by police following a meeting, but Tokunaga was soon released. He left the League in October of the following year over what he saw as their prioritizing politics over literary merit. In October 1937 he requested his publisher withdraw \"Taiyō no nai Machi\" from print in light of the breakout of war with China. He saw it as necessary for Japanese to unify during the war. He continued to publish short stories and essays that were inoffensive to the authorities throughout the Pacific War. In 1945, immediately following Japan's loss in the war, Tokunaga, Shigeharu Nakano, Yuriko Miyamoto and others formed the Shin Nihon Bungakkai (\"New Japanese Literary World\") as a successor to the various pre-war socialist literary groups. He joined the Communist Party of Japan in 1946,Taiyō no nai Machi allowed the republication of \"Taiyō no nai Machi\",Taiyō no nai Machi and was welcomed back into the proletarian literary movement.

{"query": "Fred Merkle career statistics and achievements outside of the 1908 'boner' game", "pos": ["Fred Merkle\nFred Merkle Carl Frederick Rudolf Merkle (December 20, 1888 – March 2, 1956), also documented as \"Frederick Charles Merkle,\" and nicknamed \"Bonehead\", was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball from 1907 to 1926. Although he had a lengthy career, he is best remembered for a controversial base-running mistake he made while still a teenager. Born in Watertown, Wisconsin, to Ernst Merkle, a Swiss immigrant, and Amalie Thielmann Merkle, a German American, he was raised in Toledo, Ohio. Merkle played his first Major League game at the age of 18, with the New York Giants in 1907. He was still the youngest player in the National League, and used mostly as a pinch hitter, at the time of his infamous \"boner\" in 1908. Merkle became the Giants' regular first baseman by 1910 and contributed in that role to three straight pennant winners from 1911 to 1913. He was traded to the Brooklyn Robins in August 1916 and played in his fourth World Series that year. In April 1917, the Robins sold Merkle to the Chicago Cubs, the team against which he had made his infamous play in 1908, with whom he continued as the regular first baseman through 1920. In 1918 with the Cubs, Merkle played in his fifth World Series in eight years, though he never won the championship. From 1921 to 1925, Merkle was the regular first baseman for Rochester in the International League. He returned to the Major Leagues in mid-1925, when he was acquired by the New York Yankees, but appeared in only seven games with the Yankees that year and one in 1926. After one year back in the International League as player-manager for Reading in 1927, Merkle retired. Fred Merkle was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 1953. On September 23, 1908, while playing for the New York Giants in a game against the Chicago Cubs, while he was 19 years old (the youngest player in the National League), Merkle committed a base-running error that became known as \"Merkle's Boner\" and earned him the nickname \"Bonehead\". In the bottom of the 9th inning, Merkle came to bat with two outs, and the score tied 1–1. At the time, Moose McCormick was on first base. Merkle singled and McCormick advanced to third base. Al Bridwell, the next batter, followed with a single of his own. McCormick trotted to home plate, apparently scoring the winning run. The fans in attendance, under the impression that the game was over, ran onto the field to celebrate. Meanwhile, Merkle ran to the Giants' clubhouse without touching second base.  Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers noticed this, and after retrieving a ball and touching second base, he appealed to umpire Hank O'Day, who later managed the Cubs, to call Merkle out. Since Merkle had not touched the base, the umpire called him out on a force play, meaning that McCormick's run did not count. The run was therefore nullified, the Giants' victory erased, and the score of the game remained tied. Unfortunately, the thousands of fans on the field (as well as the growing darkness in the days long before large electric lights made night games possible) prevented resumption of the game, and it was declared a tie. The Giants and the Cubs ended the season tied for first place and had a rematch at the Polo Grounds, on October 8. The Cubs won this makeup game, 4–2, thus the National League pennant. Accounts vary as to whether Evers actually retrieved the game ball or not. Some versions of the story have him running to the outfield to retrieve the correct ball. Other versions have it that he shouted for the ball, which was relayed to him from the Cubs' dugout. And still other versions have it that Giants pitcher Joe McGinnity saw what was transpiring, and threw the game ball into the stands; thus, the ball that was picked up by or relayed to Evers was a different ball entirely. The \"New York Times\" account of the play recalls that Cubs manager and first baseman Frank Chance was the one who \"grasped the situation\" and directed that the ball be thrown to him covering second base. At the time, running off the field without touching the base was common, as the rule allowing a force play after a potential game-winning run was not well known. However, Evers, who was noted as an avid student of the official rules of the game, had previously attempted the same play only a few weeks earlier, in Pittsburgh, with the same Hank O'Day umpiring. In that instance, O'Day had not seen whether the runner tagged second, so he declined Evers' appeal, but he apparently was alert to the possibility in the New York game. The outcome ensured that the rule was known to everyone afterward. Giants manager John McGraw was furious at the league office, feeling his team was robbed of a victory (and a pennant), but he never blamed Merkle for his mistake. The Cubs went on to win the 1908 World Series. The team then went through a 108-year-long championship drought, before finally winning the World Series in 2016. Bitter over the events of the controversial game, Merkle avoided baseball after his playing career ended in 1926. When he finally appeared at a Giants old-timers' game in 1950, he received a standing ovation. Fred Merkle is commemorated in his hometown of Watertown, Wisconsin. The city's primary high school baseball field at Washington Park is named Fred Merkle Field. Also, a black plaque honoring him was erected in the park on July 22, 2010. A second plaque in Watertown is on the grounds of the Octagon House. Merkle's Bar and Grill in Chicago is named after Fred Merkle. Merkle and his wife Ethel Cynthia Brownson Merkle enjoyed a lifelong marriage, from 1914 to his death in 1956. The Merkles had three daughters: Marjorie, Jeannette, and Marianne.<ref name=\"Stalker/Watertown\"></ref> In 1906, Merkle played football for the Toledo Athletic Association as an end. That season, the team was defeated by the Canton Bulldogs by a score of 31–0. Merkle died in Daytona Beach at age 67, and was interred there in Bellevue Cedar Hill Memory Gardens. As Fred had before her, Ethel died in Daytona Beach, Florida, in December 1976.", "1908 New York Giants season\n1908 New York Giants season The 1908 New York Giants season was the franchise's 26th season. The team finished in second place in the National League with a 98–56 record, one game behind the Chicago Cubs. Paced by Turkey Mike Donlin, the offense scored the most runs in the league. Donlin led the team in nearly all batting categories and was second in batting to Honus Wagner. Future Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson earned the pitching triple crown with 37 wins, 259 strikeouts, and a 1.43 ERA. However, he lost the last game of the season to Three Finger Brown of the Chicago Cubs, and the Giants finished one game back in the pennant race. That one-game playoff became necessary after Giants rookie Fred Merkle failed to touch second base at the end of a previous contest, costing them a win. In addition, they were beaten by another rookie, Phillies pitcher Harry Coveleski, three times in five days late in the season. Coveleski was subsequently nicknamed \"The Giant Killer\". The Giants opened the season on the road with a 3–1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. The Giants took five of their first six games of the season. The home opener at the Polo Grounds was the biggest in club history, as the Giants attracted over 25,000 fans. The Brooklyn Superbas took a 2–1 lead into the bottom of the ninth. Fred Merkle pinch hit for Christy Mathewson and got a ground rule double. Merkle safely advanced to third base on a sacrifice bunt. Fred Tenney hit a grounder and Merkle was caught off third. Captain Donlin hit a two run home run over the right field wall to win the home opener for the Giants by a score of 3–2. On July 4, Hooks Wiltse had a perfect game heading into the ninth inning. With two out in the ninth, the perfect game was still intact. George McQuillan was hit by a pitch and Wiltse lost the perfect game. on August 27, the Giants won 18 of their last 23 (including four in a row versus the Pittsburgh Pirates) to take the lead in the National League for the first time since April. During the Giants four game sweep of the Pirates in late August, the electric scoreboard made its debut in New York. The first electric scoreboard was outside Madison Square Garden, and there was another near the Gotham Theatre on 125th Street. On Wednesday, September 23, against the Chicago Cubs, 19-year-old Fred Merkle committed a base running error that later became known as \"Merkle's Boner\", and earned Merkle the nickname of \"Bonehead.\" In the bottom of the 9th inning, he came up to bat with two outs, and the score tied 1–1. At the time, Moose McCormick was on first base. Merkle singled, and McCormick advanced to third. Al Bridwell, the next batter, followed with a single of his own. McCormick went home, apparently scoring the winning run of the game. The fans in attendance, under the impression that the game was over, ran onto the field to celebrate. Meanwhile, Merkle, trying to escape the mob of people, ran to the Giants' clubhouse without touching second base. Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers noticed this, and after retrieving a ball and touching second base, he appealed to umpire Hank O'Day to call Merkle out. The validity of the ball was disputed – numerous accounts have Giants pitcher Joe McGinnity intercepting the real ball before Evers could get it. However, since Merkle had not touched the base, the umpire called him out on a force play, and McCormick's run did not count. Since the run was nullified, the Giants' victory was erased, and the score of the game remained tied. Unfortunately, the thousands of fans on the field (as well as the growing darkness in the days before large electric light rigs made night games possible) prevented resumption of the game, and it was declared a tie.

The Museum is located within a 19th-century building in the Indro Montanelli Garden, near the historic city gate of Porta Venezia. The structure was built between 1888 and 1893 in Neo-Romanesque style with Gothic elements. The museum is divided into five different permanent sections: Mineralogy (with a large collection of minerals from all over the world); Paleontology (with several fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms); Natural History of Man (dedicated to the origins and evolution of humans with a particular attention to the relationship of the latter with the environment); Invertebrate Zoology (dedicated to mollusks, arthropods and entomology); and Vertebrate Zoology (dedicated to vertebrates, both exotic and European). The museum also exhibits the largest Italian collection of full size dioramas (over 100) that allow visitors to observe some peculiar aspects of various ecosystems. The mineralogy section showcases several minerals from all over the world including the world's largest sulfur crystal (from the province of Pesaro-Urbino) and an 8,000 carat Brazilian topaz crystal. Also displayed are examples of londonite, quarz, phosgenite, fluorite, malachite and other minerals. This section explains the basics of paleozoology and paleobotany. Displays include fossils of several plants and animals. Among the most valuable specimens are the skeletons of two pygmy elephants (\"Palaeoloxodon falconeri\") from Sicily and the only existing fossil of the coelurosaurian theropod \"Scipionix samniticus\". The museum also houses several other casts of dinosaur skeletons such as \"Allosaurus\", \"Stegosaurus\", \"Dromaeosaurus\", and \"Plateosaurus\".

Particularities of the museum included minerals sent by the empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Collections were kept in the Central Palace of the University for more than a century. However, a new wing was added in 1778: initially named 'Comparative Anatomy', the section was later renamed 'Mineralogy and Zoology' and contained instruments that had belonged to the surgeon Antonio Scarpa. In those years, the museum had housed over 24,000 specimens. Each part of the museum became an autonomous museum in 1875: that one of Anatomy was moved into Palace Botta in 1903, likewise the one of Zoology was moved in 1935.

Cornell was born in Palo Alto, California, where his parents were completing graduate degrees at nearby Stanford University. Two years later he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was a professor of civil engineering at MIT. Here he grew up with his younger brother and sister, with yearlong intermezzos in Berkeley, California, and Lisbon, Portugal, where his father spent sabbatical years. In Cambridge he attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. The year before his graduation he moved back to California with his mother and finished high school at San Francisco's Lowell High School, a local magnet school for academically talented students. After high school he enrolled at Stanford University, where he was to meet his future wife, Celeste Landry. As an undergraduate he earned money as an assistant in the various low-temperature physics groups on campus. He was doing well both in his courses and his jobs in the labs and seemed set for a career in physics. He however doubted whether he wished to pursue such a career, or rather a different one in literature or politics. Halfway through his undergraduate years he went to China and Taiwan for nine months to volunteer teaching conversational English and to study Chinese. He learned that this was not where his talents lay, and returned to Stanford with renewed resolve to pursue his true talent – physics. He graduated with honors and distinction in 1985. For graduate school he returned to MIT. There he joined David Pritchard's group, which had a running experiment that tried to measure the mass of the electron neutrino from the beta decay of tritium. Although he was unable to determine the mass of the neutrino, Cornell did obtain his PhD in 1990. After obtaining his doctorate he joined Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado Boulder as a postdoctoral researcher on a small laser cooling experiment. During his two years as a postdoc he came up with a plan to combine laser cooling and evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap to create a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). Based on his proposal he was offered a permanent position at JILA/NIST in Boulder. For synthesizing the first Bose–Einstein condensate in 1995, Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001. He is currently a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and a physicist at the United States Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology. His lab is located at JILA. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1998 and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Although the \"Book of Han\" contains reference to \" (read \"Han Yifu\" in modern Standard Mandarin), the word 'Hanfu' () does not appear in A Dictionary of Current Chinese, Cihai or other important dictionaries of Standard Mandarin Chinese. Ancient Chinese clothing was influential to other traditional clothing such as the Japanese kimono, yukata and the Vietnamese Áo giao lĩnh. Traditional Han clothing comprises all traditional clothing classifications of the Han Chinese with a recorded history of more than three millennia until the end of the Ming Dynasty. From the beginning of its history, Han clothing (especially in elite circles) was inseparable from silk, supposedly discovered by the Yellow Emperor's consort, Leizu. The Shang dynasty (c. 1600 BC – 1000 BC), developed the rudiments of \"Hanfu\"; it consisted of a \"yi\", a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called \"chang\", worn with a \"bixi\", a length of fabric that reached the knees. Vivid primary colors and green were used, due to the degree of technology at the time. The dynasty to follow the Shang, the Western Zhou dynasty, established a strict hierarchical society that used clothing as a status meridian, and inevitably, the height of one’s rank influenced the ornateness of a costume. Such markers included the length of a skirt, the wideness of a sleeve and the degree of ornamentation. In addition to these class-oriented developments, Han Chinese clothing became looser, with the introduction of wide sleeves and jade decorations hung from the sash which served to keep the \"yi\" closed. The \"yi\" was essentially wrapped over, in a style known as \"jiaoling youren\", or wrapping the right side over before the left, because of the initially greater challenge to the right-handed wearer (people of Zhongyuan discouraged left-handedness like many other historical cultures, considering it unnatural, barbarian, uncivilized, and unfortunate). The style of historical Han clothing can be summarized as containing garment elements that are arranged in distinctive and sometimes specific ways. This is different from the traditional garment of other ethnic groups in China, most notably the Manchu-influenced clothes, the \"qipao\", which is popularly assumed to be the de facto traditional Han Chinese garb. A comparison of the two styles can be seen as the following provides: !Component!!Han!!Manchu", "Peng Zu\nPeng Zu Peng Zu (彭祖, \"Ancestor Peng\")(篯铿) is a legendary long-lived figure in China. He supposedly lived over 800 years in the Shang dynasty. Some legends say that one year was 60 days in ancient China; that made him more than 130 years old. Others say he was over 200 years old or over 400 years old. Another says he was accidentally left off of the death list in heaven.  Peng Zu was regarded as a saint in Taoism. The pursuit of elixir of life by practitioners of Taoism was highly influenced by Peng Zu. He is well known in Chinese culture as a symbol for longevity, nutrition treatments, and sex therapy treatments. Legend maintains he married more than 100 wives and fathered hundreds of children, as late as in his 800s. According to the Spring and Autumn period's \"Guoyu (Discourses of the States)\", the Han dynasty's \"Shiben (Genealogy)\", and the Tang dynasty's \"Kuodi Zhi (Record of Geography)\", Peng Zu was the founder of Dapeng and made marquis by the kings of the Shang dynasty. One of his life extending techniques was coitus skill, which purportedly extracts female energy into the male body (harvesting from Yin to supplement Yang). He ate naturally and used herbs to enrich his nutrition. He was known for cooking excellent soup. Chinese people believe that his long life, good health, and sexual energy were attributed to the food he ate. His life style emphasized meditation. He was viewed as one of the pioneers of Qigong. The place where he lived and died was called Peng Shan (彭山, \"Peng Mountain\"), from which the county was named (in Sichuan Province, China). His shrine, tomb, and statue are preserved in Peng Shan County. There is a Peng Zu Festival every year for people to pay respects to his legacy and pray for healthier, happier, and longer lives. His pictures hang in houses all over China and are popular birthday gifts for senior citizens.", "Four occupations\nFour occupations The four occupations () or \"four categories of the people\" () was an occupation classification used in ancient China by either Confucian or Legalist scholars as far back as the late Zhou dynasty and is considered a central part of the fengjian social structure (c. 1046–256 BC). These were the \"shi\" (gentry scholars), the \"nong\" (peasant farmers), the \"gong\" (artisans and craftsmen), and the \"shang\" (merchants and traders). The four occupations were not always arranged in this order. The four categories were not socioeconomic classes; wealth and standing did not correspond to these categories, nor were they hereditary. The system did not factor in all social groups present in premodern Chinese society, and its broad categories were more an idealization than a practical reality. The commercialization of Chinese society in the Song and Ming periods further blurred the lines between these four occupations. The definition of the identity of the \"shi\" class changed over time—from warriors, to aristocratic scholars, and finally to scholar-bureaucrats. There was also a gradual fusion of the wealthy merchant and landholding gentry classes, culminating in the late Ming Dynasty.  In some manner this system of social order was adopted throughout the Chinese cultural sphere. In Japanese it is called \"mibunsei\" (身分制) and is sometimes stated as , although in Japan it became a hereditary caste system. In Korean as \"Sa, nong, gong, sang\" (사농공상), and in Vietnamese as \"Sĩ, nông, công, thương (士農工商). The main difference in adaptation was the definition of the \"shi\" (士). From existing literary evidence, commoner categories in China were employed for the first time during the Warring States period (403–221 BC). Despite this, Eastern-Han (AD 25–220) historian Ban Gu (AD 32–92) asserted in his \"Book of Han\" that the four occupations for commoners had existed in the Western Zhou (c. 1050 – 771 BC) era, which he considered a golden age. However, it is now known that the classification of four occupations as Ban Gu understood it did not exist until the 2nd century BC. Ban explained the social hierarchy of each group in descending order: Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants; each of the four peoples had their respective profession. Those who studied in order to occupy positions of rank were called the \"shi\" (scholars). Those who cultivated the soil and propagated grains were called \"nong\" (farmers). Those who manifested skill (\"qiao\") and made utensils were called \"gong\" (artisans). Those who transported valuable articles and sold commodities were called \"shang\" (merchants). The Rites of Zhou described the four groups in a different order, with merchants before farmers. The Han-era text \"Guliang Zhuan\" placed merchants second after scholars, and the Warring States-era \"Xunzi\" placed farmers before scholars. The \"Shuo Yuan\" mentioned a quotation which stressed the ideal of equality for the four occupations. Under these schemes, multiple dynasties attempted to create a hereditary military caste by exchanging border farmland or other privileges for service. However, in every instance, the policy would fail due to rampant desertion caused by the extremely low regard for violent occupations, and subsequently these armies had to replaced with hired mercenaries or even peasant militia.  However, for those without formal education, the quickest way to power and the upper echelons of society was to join the military. Although the soldier was looked upon with a bit of disdain by scholar-officials and cultured people, military officers with successful careers could gain a considerable amount of prestige. Despite the claim of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Entertaining was considered to be of little use to society and was usually performed by the underclass known as the \"mean people\" (). Entertainers and courtiers were often dependents upon the wealthy or were associated with the often-perceived immoral pleasure grounds of urban entertainment districts. Musicians who played music as full-time work were of low status. To give them official recognition would have given them more prestige. \"Proper\" music was considered a fundamental aspect of nurturing of character and good government, but vernacular music, as defined as having \"irregular movements\" was criticised as corrupting for listeners. In spite of this, Chinese society idolized many musicians, even women musicians (who were seen as seductive) such as Cai Yan (ca. 177) and Wang Zhaojun (40-30 B.C). Musical abilities were a prime consideration in marriage desirability. During the Ming dynasty, female musicians were so common that they even played for imperial rituals. Private theatre troupes in the homes of wealthy families were a common practice. Professional dancers of the period were of low social status and many entered the profession through poverty, although some such as Zhao Feiyan achieved higher status by becoming concubines. Another dancer was Wang Wengxu () who was forced to become a domestic singer-dancer but who later bore the future Emperor Xuan of Han. Institutions were set up to oversee the training and performances of music and dances in the imperial court, such as the Great Music Bureau (太樂署) and the Drums and Pipes Bureau (鼓吹署) responsible for ceremonial music. Emperor Gaozu set up the Royal Academy, while Emperor Xuanzong established the Pear Garden Academy for the training of musicians, dancers and actors. There were around 30,000 musicians and dancers at the imperial court during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, with most specialising in \"yanyue\". All were under the administration of the Drums and Pipes Bureau and an umbrella organization called the Taichang Temple (太常寺). Professional artists had similarly low status. Slavery was comparatively uncommon in Chinese history but was still practiced, largely as a judicial punishment for crimes. In the Han and Tang dynasties, it was illegal to trade in Chinese slaves (that were not criminals), but foreign slaves were acceptable. The Xin dynasty emperor Wang Mang, the Ming dynasty Hongwu emperor, and Qing dynasty Yongzheng emperor attempted to ban slavery entirely but were not successful. Illegal enslavement of children frequently occurred under the guise of adoption from poor families. It has been speculated by researchers such as Sue Gronewold that up to 80% of late Qing era prostitutes may have been slaves. Six dynasties, Tang dynasty, and to a partial extent Song dynasty society also contained a complex system of servile groups included under \"mean people\" (賤人) that formed intermediate standings between the four occupations and outright slavery.

Some fans advised him to gather his posts into a book to publish, Dangnian Mingyue accepted. By March 21, 2009, Dangnian Mingyue finished posting the last chapter about the Chongzhen Emperor. There had no any standard history novel existed before this book was published. Most of the historical novels before this one using more fictions but little true or standard history. The book has sold over 5 million copies, it was the best selling book in 2007-2008 period and other awards."]}
{"query": "Provincial Legislature legislative process beyond its basic structure described in government overview", "pos": ["Provincial legislature (South Africa)\nProvincial legislature (South Africa) In South Africa, a provincial legislature is the legislative branch of the government of a province. The provincial legislatures are unicameral and vary in size from 30 to 80 members, depending on the population of the province. Each legislature is chaired by a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker. The original four provinces of South Africa (the provinces that existed from 1910 to 1994) had provincial councils elected by the white population of the provinces. The provincial councils were weak; they appointed an executive council (a provincial cabinet) but could not appoint or remove the Administrator (the executive head) of the province. The Administrators were chosen by the Governor-General (before 1961) or the State President (after 1961). The provincial councils' legislative powers were also strictly limited to specific topics. In 1986 the national Parliament abolished the provincial councils entirely, instead allowing the State President to appoint the whole executive council. The current provincial legislatures were established by the 1993 Interim Constitution of South Africa upon the creation of the new nine provinces. The 1993 Constitution came into effect (and the provinces came into existence) on 27 April 1994; the election on the same day elected the first provincial legislatures. For the most part, the provincial legislatures have been controlled by the African National Congress. The exceptions are the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, which was controlled by the Inkatha Freedom Party from 1994 to 2004; and the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, which was controlled by the (New) National Party from 1994 to 2004 (sometimes in coalition with the Democratic Party) and since 2009 has been controlled by the Democratic Alliance. The Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) are elected by party-list proportional representation with a closed list, using the largest remainder method with the Droop quota to allocate any surplus. The usual term of a provincial legislature is five years. Elections are run by the Independent Electoral Commission, and have been held in 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014. Although it is not constitutionally required, thus far all the elections have been held simultaneously with elections to the National Assembly. The legislature has the power to pass legislation in various fields enumerated in the national constitution; in some fields the legislative power is shared with the national parliament, while in others it is reserved to the province. The fields include such matters as health, education (except universities), agriculture, housing, environmental protection, and development planning. In fields outside the power of a provincial legislature, it may recommend legislation to the National Assembly. A provincial legislature may also enact a constitution for that province, if two-thirds of the members vote in favour. The powers of the provincial legislature are bound only by the national constitution and the provincial constitution (if one exists). The provincial legislature of a province chooses the Premier, the head of the provincial executive. The legislature can force the Premier to resign by passing a motion of no confidence, or remove them for misconduct or inability. Although the Executive Council (cabinet) is chosen by the Premier, the legislature may pass a motion of no confidence to force the Premier to reconstitute the Council. A provincial legislature also appoints that province's delegates to the National Council of Provinces, allocating delegates to parties in proportion to the number of seats each party holds in the legislature. The legislature oversees the administration of the provincial government, and the Premier and the members of the Executive Council are required to report to the legislature on the performance of their responsibilities. The legislature also controls the finances of the provincial government by way of the appropriation bills which determine the provincial budget. This list shows nine provincial legislatures and their party composition after the elections of 2014.", "Legislature\nLegislature A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. Laws enacted by legislatures are known as primary legislation. Legislatures observe and steer governing actions and usually have exclusive authority to amend the budget or budgets involved in the process.  The members of a legislature are called legislators. In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber. Names for national legislatures include \"parliament\", \"congress\", \"diet\", and \"assembly\", depending on country. Each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of parliamentary procedure to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a quorum. Some of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to committees made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s). The members of a legislature usually represent different political parties; the members from each party generally meet as a caucus to organize their internal affairs. Legislatures vary widely in the amount of political power they wield, compared to other political players such as judiciaries, militaries, and executives. In 2009, political scientists M. Steven Fish and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German Bundestag, the Italian Parliament, and the Mongolian State Great Khural tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's House of Representatives and Somalia's Transitional Federal Assembly (since replaced by the Federal Parliament of Somalia) tied for least powerful. Some political systems follow the principle of legislative supremacy, which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written constitution. Such a system renders the legislature more powerful. In parliamentary and semi-presidential systems of government, the executive is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a vote of no confidence. On the other hand, according to the separation of powers doctrine, the legislature in a presidential system is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the judiciary and the executive. Legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to administrative or executive agencies. Legislatures are made up of individual members, known as legislators, who vote on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of \"seats\" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 \"seats\" has 100 members. By extension, an electoral district that elects a single legislator can also be described as a \"seat\", as, for, example, in the phrases \"safe seat\" and \"marginal seat\". A legislature may debate and vote upon bills as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate assemblies, called by various names including \"legislative chambers\", \"debate chambers\", and \"houses\", which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is unicameral, one divided into two chambers is bicameral, and one divided into three chambers is tricameral. In bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the upper house, while the other is considered the lower house. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by administrative divisions rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly parliamentary systems, the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly presidential systems, the upper house has equal or even greater power.  In federations, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is a case with the supranational legislature of the European Union. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governmentsas in the European Union and in Germany and, before 1913, in the United Statesor be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in Australia and the United States since 1913. Tricameral legislatures are rare; the Massachusetts Governor's Council still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in South Africa. Tetracameral legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia. Legislatures vary widely in their size. Among national legislatures, China's National People's Congress is the largest with 2 980 members, while Vatican City's Pontifical Commission is the smallest with 7. Neither legislature is democratically elected, with the National People's Congress being indirectly elected, as well as this the National People's Congress has little independent power. Legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation; the smaller the legislature, the more efficiently it can operate, but the larger the legislature, the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents. Comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country's lower house tends to be proportional to the cube root of its population; that is, the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population, but much more slowly.", "Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature\nMpumalanga Provincial Legislature The Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature (MPL), previously known as the Eastern Transvaal Legislature, is the primary legislative body of the South African province of Mpumalanga.  The First legislature was inaugurated in May 1994 as the Eastern Transvaal Legislature. It was renamed in 1995. The Provincial Legislature, along with the other provincial legislatures of South Africa, exists by virtue of Chapter 6 of the Constitution of South Africa. It is unicameral, and consists of 30 members elected by a system of party-list proportional representation. The Fifth Provincial Legislature was elected on 7 May 2014 in South Africa's 2014 general elections. A majority of the members belong to the African National Congress. The Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature elects the Premier of Mpumalanga. The legislature can force the Premier to resign by passing a motion of no confidence. Although the Executive Council is appointed by the Premier of Mpumalanga, the legislature may pass a motion of no confidence to compel the Premier to reorient the Council. The legislature also appoints Mpumalanga's delegates to the National Council of Provinces, allocating delegates to parties in proportion to the number of seats each party holds in the legislature. The legislature has the power to pass legislation in various fields mentioned in the national constitution; in some fields the legislative power is shared with the national parliament, while in others it is reserved to Mpumalanga alone. The fields include such matters as health, education, agriculture, housing, environmental protection, and development planning. The legislature oversees the administration of the provincial government, and the Premier and the members of the Executive Council are required to report to the legislature on the performance of their responsibilities. The legislature also manages the fiscal matters of the provincial government by way of the appropriation bills which determine the provincial budget. The Provincial Legislature consists of 30 members, who are elected through a system of party list proportional representation with closed lists. In other words, each voter casts a vote for one political party, and seats in the legislature are allocated to the parties in proportion to the number of votes received. The seats are then filled by members in accordance with lists submitted by the parties before the election. The Legislature is elected for a term of five years, unless it is dissolved early. This may occur if the legislature votes to dissolve and it is at least three years since the last election, or if the Premiership falls vacant and the legislature fails to elect a new Premier within ninety days. By convention all nine provincial legislatures and the National Assembly are elected on the same day. The most recent election was held on 7 May 2014. The following table summarises the results. Each of the nine provincial legislature has Presiding Officers. The Presiding Officers can be the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Chairperson of Committees and the Deputy Chairperson of Committees. The Speaker of the Legislature is Violet Sizani Siwela and her deputy is Bonakele Amos Majuba."], "neg": ["Provincial Congress\nProvincial Congress \"Provincial Congress\" can refer to one of several extra-legal legislative bodies established in some of the Thirteen Colonies early in the American Revolution. Some were referred to as congresses while others used different terms for a similar type body. These bodies were generally renamed or replaced with other bodies when the provinces declared themselves states. Colonial government in America was a systems of governance modeled after the British government of the time, with the king corresponding to the governor, the House of Commons to the colonial assembly, and the House of Lords to the governor's council. Colonial assemblies did not believe that the British Parliament had authority over them to impose taxes (or certain other laws), that it was the colonial assembly’s duty to decide what should be imposed on their fellow colonists (the Massachusetts Circular Letter was an example of that argument). Legally, the crown governor's authority was unassailable, but assemblies began to resist efforts by some governors and royal officials to enforce acts of Parliament or to raise local taxes that governors demanded. In resisting that authority, assemblies resorted to arguments based upon natural rights and the common welfare, giving life to the notion that governments derived, or ought to derive, their authority from the consent of the governed. Committees of correspondence were formed as shadow governments in the Thirteen colonies prior to the American Revolution. During the First Continental Congress (in 1774), committees of inspection were formed to enforce the Continental Association trade boycott with Britain in response to the British Parliament’s Intolerable Acts. By 1775, the committees had become counter-governments that gradually replaced royal authority and took control of local governments. Known as the Committees of Safety, they regulated the economy, politics, morality, and militia of their individual communities. After the British Proclamation of Rebellion and the King’s speech before Parliament (27 October 1775) the colonies moved towards independence.  Provisional governments began to create new state constitutions and governments. Committees of safety were a later outcome of the committees of correspondence. Committees of safety were executive bodies that governed during adjournments of, were created by, and derived their authority from provincial assemblies or congresses.  In some colonies there were little or no changes to their assemblies until statehood. They had no need of a provisional legislative body since their governors did not dissolve or prevent the legislative assemblies from meeting. This was the case in the Charter colonies with more autonomy, such as Connecticut and Rhode Island, which elected colonial governors who were aligned with their assemblies. (Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull and Rhode Island Governor Nicholas Cooke served as both the last colonial governors and first state governors). The Delaware Colony was a proprietary colony under Governor John Penn of the Province of Pennsylvania, which included the “Lower Counties of the Delaware\", but it maintained a separate Delaware assembly. It was generally allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies."]}
{"query": "Norma constellation mythology instead of star content", "pos": ["Norma (constellation)\nNorma (constellation) Norma is a small constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere between Ara and Lupus, one of twelve drawn up in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments. Its name is Latin for normal, referring to a right angle, and is variously considered to represent a rule, a carpenter's square, a set square or a level. It remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Four of Norma's brighter stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up a square in the field of faint stars. Gamma Normae is the brightest star with an apparent magnitude of 4.0. Mu Normae is one of the most luminous stars known, with a luminosity between a quarter million and one million times that of the Sun. Four star systems are known to harbour planets. The Milky Way passes through Norma, and the constellation contains eight open clusters visible to observers with binoculars. The constellation also hosts Abell 3627, also called the Norma Cluster, one of the most massive galaxy clusters known. Norma was introduced in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name \"l’Équerre et la Règle\", \"the Square and Rule\", after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level in a set of draughtsman instruments, in his 1756 map of the southern stars. The level was dangling from the apex of a triangle, leading some astronomers to conclude he was renaming \"l’Équerre et la Règle\" to \"le Niveau\", \"the level\". In any case, the constellation's name had been shortened and Latinised by Lacaille to \"Norma\" by 1763. Norma is bordered by Scorpius to the north, Lupus to the northwest, Circinus to the west, Triangulum Australe to the south and Ara to the east. Covering 165.3 square degrees and 0.401% of the night sky, it ranks 74th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Nor'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of ten segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −42.27° and −60.44°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 29°N. Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Mu in 1756, however his Alpha Normae was transferred into Scorpius and left unnamed by Francis Baily, before being named N Scorpii by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who felt its brightness warranted recognition. Though Beta Normae was depicted on his star chart, it was inadvertently left out of Lacaille's 1763 catalogue, was likewise transferred to Scorpio by Baily and named H Scorpii by Gould. Norma's brightest star, Gamma Normae, is only of magnitude 4.0. Overall, there are 44 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. The four main stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up a square in this region of faint stars. Gamma and Gamma Normae are an optical double, and not a true binary star system. Located 129 ± 1 light-years away from Earth, Gamma Normae is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III around 2 to 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. It has swollen to a diameter 10 times that of the Sun and shines with 45 times the Sun's luminosity. It also is half of a close optical double, with a magnitude 10 companion star related by line of sight only. Gamma Normae is a yellow-white supergiant, located much further away at around 1500 light-years from Earth. Epsilon Normae is a spectroscopic binary, with two blue-white main sequence stars of almost equal mass and spectral type (B3V) orbiting each other every 3.26 days. There is a third star separated by 22 arcseconds, which has a magnitude of 7.5 and is likely a smaller B-type main sequence star of spectral type B9V. The system is 530 ± 20 light-years distant from Earth, Eta Normae is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III with an apparent magnitude of 4.65. It shines with a luminosity approximately 66 times that of the Sun. Iota Normae is a multiple star system. The AB (mag 5.2 and 5.76) pair orbit each other with a period of 26.9 years; they are 2.77 and 2.71 times as massive as the Sun respectively. The pair are 128 ± 6 light-years distant from Earth. A third component is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8.02. Mu Normae is a remote blue supergiant of spectral type O9.7Iab, one of the most luminous stars known, but is partially obscured by distance and cosmic dust. Uncertainties regarding its distance leave open the possibility that Mu Normae could be between 250,000 and one million times as luminous and up to 60 times as massive as the Sun, though it is more likely to have around 500,000 times the Sun's luminosity and 40 times its mass. It is suspected of being an Alpha Cygni variable, with a magnitude range of 4.87–4.98. QU Normae is another hot blue-white star that is a variable, ranging from magnitude 5.27 to 5.41 over 4.8 days. Lying near Eta Normae is R Normae, a Mira variable. Its visual magnitude range is 6.5–13.9 and its average period is 507.5 days. Located halfway between Eta Normae and Gamma Circini is T Normae, another Mira variable. It ranges from magnitude 6.2 to 13.6, with a period of 244 days. S Normae is a well-known Cepheid variable with a magnitude range of 6.12–6.77 and a period of 9.75411 days. It is located at the centre of the open cluster NGC 6087. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8-G0Ib that is 6.3 times as massive as the Sun. A binary, it has a 2.4 solar mass () companion that is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. A binary system composed of two wolf-rayet stars, colloquially called Apep, has been identifed as a possible progenitor of a long gamma-ray burst. Located around 8000 light-years distant, it would be the first such in the Milky Way. IM Normae is one of only ten recurrent novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20 times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0 km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67 hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk. Four star systems are known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164 light-years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4 days. Announced in 2004, it was the first planet discovered by the HARPS spectrograph. HD 148156 is a star 168 ± 7 light-years distant. Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun, it was found to have a roughly Jupiter-size planet with an orbital period of 2.8 years. HD 143361 is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9 AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20 days. HD 142415 is approximately 113 light-years distant and has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days. Due to its location on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep-sky objects such as star clusters, including eight open clusters visible through binoculars. NGC 6087 is the brightest of the open clusters in Norma with a magnitude of 5.4. It lies in the southeastern corner of the constellation between Alpha Centauri and Zeta Arae. Thought to be around 100 million years old, it is about 3300 light-years away and is around 14 light-years in diameter. Its brightest member is the Cepheid variable S Normae. A rich background star field makes it less distinct, though around 36 member stars are visible though a 10 cm telescope at 150x magnification. Located 0.4° north of Kappa Normae is NGC 6067, which has an integrated magnitude of 5.6 though it is indistinct as it lies in a rich star field. It is thought to be around 102 million years old, and contain 891 solar masses. Two Cepheid variables—QZ Normae and V340 Normae—have been identified as members of the cluster. Fainter open clusters include NGC 6134 with a combined magnitude of 7.2 and located 4000 light-years away from Earth, the spread-out NGC 6167 of magnitude 6.7, NGC 6115 near Gamma Normae, NGC 6031 and NGC 5999. Located around 4900 light-years distant is Shapley 1 (or PK 329+02.1), a planetary nebula better known as the \"Fine-Ring Nebula\". Appearing ring-shaped, it is thought that it actually is cylindrical and oriented directly at Earth. Around 8700 years old, it lies about five degrees west-northwest of Gamma Normae. Its integrated magnitude is 13.6 and its mean surface brightness is 13.9. The central star is a white dwarf of magnitude 14.03. Mz 1 is a bipolar planetary nebula, thought to be an hourglass shape tilted at an angle to observers on Earth, some 3500 light-years distant. Mz 3—known as the Ant Nebula as it resembles an ant—has a complex appearance, with at least four outflow jets and two large lobes visible. Approximately 200 million light-years from Earth with a redshift of 0.016 is Abell 3627; also called the Norma Cluster, it is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.", "Norma Arm\nNorma Arm The Norma Arm is a minor spiral arm of the Milky Way extending from and around its central hub region. The inner portion of the Arm is called the \"Norma Arm\" in narrow meaning. The outer part of it is identified either with the Cygnus Arm, which lies outside the Perseus Arm, or the Outer Arm, which is located farther away from the center of the Galaxy than the Cygnus Arm. The Norma Arm has a radius of 15.5 ± 2.8 kpc. It is named for the Norma constellation, through which the Arm as seen from Earth passes. Like many other galaxies of similar type, the Milky Way consists of a large mass of stars shaped into the form of a relatively flat disc by gravity. The disc is rotating, with the dense central body of stars moving at greater speeds than those toward the rim of the disc. As a result, the pattern of stars within the Galaxy as viewed from directly above or below the disc has formed into a spiral. Because of localised gravitational variations, the spiral pattern has itself formed several distinct 'spiral arms', where particularly large numbers of stars can be found."], "neg": ["Gamma1 Normae\nGamma1 Normae Gamma Normae, Latinized from γ Normae, is a single, yellow-white hued star in the southern constellation of Norma.

Batting from the leadoff spot, he responded with a .281 average, 101 runs, 186 hits, 11 home runs and 59 RBIs. He led off the World Series against the New York Giants with a home run. In 1955, he hit .306 with 22 home runs and 77 RBIs. In December 1957, Smith was traded by Cleveland along with Early Wynn to the Chicago White Sox for Minnie Miñoso and Fred Hatfield, in a deal that was very unpopular among Chicago fans (Miñoso was \"their guy\"). He slumped in his first year with the White Sox to the point that eccentric owner Bill Veeck held an \"Al Smith Night\" to honor his outfielder. Anyone named Smith, Smythe, Schmidt, or Smithe was admitted free and given a button that said, \"I'm a Smith and I'm for Al.\" On his big night, Smith went one-for-four, hitting into two easy outs with runners in scoring position, and dropped a fly ball that led to the Boston Red Sox's winning run. (Comiskey Park, August 26, 1959). Smith would contribute enough to help his team win the American League pennant, its first in 40 years, en route to the 1959 World Series. It was during this series that Smith would enter baseball journalism history. In Game Two at Comiskey Park, Smith retreated to the left field wall in pursuit of a long drive hit by Charlie Neal of the Los Angeles Dodgers. As Smith watched the ball sail into the third row seats for a home run, a fan (Melvin Piehl, an executive for a motor-oil company) seated in the first row trying to catch the ball, accidentally tipped over his cup of beer, dousing Smith's head and face. Smith estimated that he signed photographs depicting that moment at least 200,000 times, and without making a cent on it. The photograph was taken by AP Chicago Tribune staff photographer John Raymond Gora, who died in 2003. In 1960, Smith won the respect of the fans by hitting a career-high .315 and making the league All-Star team. In 1961, he slugged a career-high 28 home runs, and led the White Sox in home runs that season. In 1962, he hit .292, and again led the White Sox with 16 home runs. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles at age 35. Smith was sent to the Baltimore Orioles before the 1963 season with Luis Aparicio in the same transaction that brought Hoyt Wilhelm, Dave Nicholson, Pete Ward and Ron Hansen to the White Sox. His last major league season was in 1964, when he divided his playing time between the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox.

Smith died in 2002, at the age of 73 in Hammond, Indiana.

{"query": "Norman Conquest causes and consequences instead of Guy of Amiens poem", "pos": ["Carmen de Hastingae Proelio\nCarmen de Hastingae Proelio The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio (\"Song of the Battle of Hastings\") is a 20th century name for the Carmen Widonis, the earliest history of the Norman invasion of England from September to December 1066, in Latin. It is attributed to Bishop Guy of Amiens, a noble of Ponthieu and monastically-trained bishop and administrator close to the French court, who eventually served as a chaplain for Matilda of Flanders, William the Conqueror's queen. Guy was an uncle to Count Guy of Ponthieu, who figures rather prominently in the Bayeux Tapestry as the vassal of Duke William of Normandy who captured Harold Godwinson in 1064. The \"Carmen\" is generally accepted as the earliest surviving written account of the Norman Conquest. It focuses on the Battle of Hastings and its immediate aftermath, although it also offers insights into navigation, urban administration, the siege of London, and ecclesiastical culture. It is in poetic form, 835 lines of hexameters and elegiac couplets, and is preserved only in two twelfth-century copies from St Eucharius-Matthias in Trier, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 10615-729, folios 227v-230v, and Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 9799-809 (the latter containing only the last sixty-six lines). The \"Carmen\" was most likely composed within months of the coronation of William as king of England (Christmas Day, 1066)—probably sometime in 1067, possibly as early as Easter of that year, to be performed at the royal festivities in Normandy, where King William I presided. The motivation for the poem's production and performance is open to debate. Queen Matilda may have commissioned the \"Carmen\" as an entertainment and to memorialize her husband's conquest, as queens customarily commissioned works of history composed by clerics and Guy d'Amiens was known in the court of her father, Count Baldwin V of Flanders, where the bishop had witnessed a charter in 1056 with Earl (later King) Harold, Count Guy of Ponthieu, and Count Eustace of Boulogne. This theory is suggested by the work praising the allies from France, Boulogne, Ponthieu, Brittany, Maine, and the new Norman kingdom in Apulia, Calabria and Sicily. All the allies would have attended the Easter celebrations for the sharing-out of war booty. In 1066 Bishop Guy may have sought to win royal esteem, possibly damaged by the involvement of Hugh of Ponthieu in the death of King Harold and the senior family's attempts to assassinate the young duke in childhood. Bishop Guy himself was out of favour with the pope, and it has been suggested that he wanted to garner some Norman influence by writing the \"Carmen\" in William's honor and inviting Lanfranc of Pavia, abbot of Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen and later archbishop of Canterbury (to whom the Proem of the poem is dedicated) to use his influence with king and pope. A further possibility (though none of these are mutually exclusive) is that Guy composed the \"Carmen\" to present Eustace, Count of Boulogne, in a favourable light in order to reverse King William's banishment of Count Eustace following his failed invasion of England in the autumn of 1067 (Eustace remained in fact out of favour until late in the 1070s). The \"Carmen\" possesses exceptional historical importance as an early account of the Norman Conquest. It is the most vivid of the original written accounts and practically the only one to give a non-Norman point of view in detail. The Bayeux Tapestry is problematic; the identity and purpose of its creators is unknown, though it bears evidence of English involvement in its production. In fact, it is the Carmen's very vividness which has caused it in the past to come under attack as either a forgery, fraud or at the least a later, 12th-century source. Frank Barlow argued that the \"Carmen\" was most likely from the year 1067, and following Elisabeth van Houts's arguments in her article \"Latin Poetry and the Anglo-Norman Court 1066-1135: The \"Carmen de Hastingae Proelio,\"\" this is the commonly accepted scholarly opinion. The \"Carmen\" is notable for literary reasons, too. It describes the Norman Conquest in terms borrowed from classical and Carolingian epic and praise poetry but in ways that contrast with other contemporary praise poets. The ironic application of classical and Carolingian language to William sows doubt about his faithfulness and piety (two core political values for the Carolingians and the Capetians). This indicates that the contradictions and early weaknesses of William's conquest and regime were already apparent in 1067, even as Guy could praise William for his achievement."], "neg": ["Mise of Amiens\nMise of Amiens The Mise of Amiens was a settlement given by King Louis IX of France on 23 January 1264 in the conflict between King Henry III of England and his rebellious barons, led by Simon de Montfort. Louis' one-sided decision for King Henry led directly to the hostilities of the Barons' War. The conflict between king and magnates was caused by dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford that essentially left royal government in the hands of a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative and decided clearly in favour of Henry. The outcome was unacceptable for the rebellious barons, and war between the two parties broke out almost immediately after the announcement of the settlement. After a victory at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, Montfort took over control of government, but the success was short-lived. Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, but by the end of 1266 the final garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth. By 1264, the reign of Henry III was deeply troubled by disputes between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors. One source of discontent was the influence two groups of royal favourites enjoyed at court: the Savoyards, relatives of Queen Eleanor of Provence, and the king's half-brothers, known as Poitevins or Lusignans. The native nobility were offended by the great political influence held by these foreigners. Secondly, the king had in 1254 accepted Pope Innocent IV's offer of the crown of Sicily for his younger son Edmund. The offer involved repelling the current Hohenstaufen rulers of the island, and proved to be very expensive. Lastly, there was a personal dispute between King Henry and one of his subjects, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. Montfort, a foreigner himself, was initially on good terms with Henry, and had in 1238 married the king's sister Eleanor. The two fell out, however, and Montfort became the leader of the opposition, together with Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster. The provisions remained in effect for three years; at one point Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Ieven joined forces with Montfort. It was not until 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving a papal annulment of the provisions, he reassumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, Henry's governing deteriorated the situation once more. He failed to reconcile with Montfort, and alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept the conditions of the provisions. The Lord Edward, now firmly on the side of his father against Montfort, now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up. Cornered, Montfort had to accept a truce and agree to submit the issue to arbitration by the French king Louis IX. On 28 December 1263 Henry left for France to present his case to King Louis. Montfort was prevented from attending by an accident, and he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried once before, in September, to appeal to the French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons. Two documents survive of the barons' complaints. In the first of these, the barons reiterated the background of the conflict, and stressed the fact that the king himself had accepted the conditions of the provisions. Henry had in fact, in an effort to gain public support, pledged to uphold the provisions, a fact that was now made the most of. The document further goes on to explain the reform instituted by the baronial council. In order to restore law and peacekeeping to the country, the council had installed a new Chief Justiciar and Chancellor. They had also appointed new sheriffs in the counties, who were to be directly accountable to the government and be replaced annually. The king had violated these conditions, it was argued, when he had appointed his own chancellor and a number of sheriffs. He had also taken over custody of Winchester Castle, which had been given over to Montfort by the provisions. Furthermore, there were accusation made against individual royal adherents, such as Roger Mortimer for his military raids in the Welsh Marches. The second document goes into more detail on the king's alleged transgressions. By extortionate taxation, it was claimed, Henry had impoverished the land. He had also infringed the liberties of the Church, violated Magna Carta, and corrupted justice. When Louis IX made his decision on 23 January 1264, it was entirely in favour of Henry III. The settlement starts out by reiterating the declarations of the two parties, where they place the decision fully in the hands of the French king. Louis invoked the difficulties England had suffered over the previous years, and stressed the importance of a resolution. Since the pope had already invalidated the provisions, Louis decided to \"...quash and invalidate all these provisions, ordinances, and obligations, or whatever else they may be called...\", and absolved the king from any adherence to them. Castles that were handed over to the barons as part of the agreement were to be given back to the king, and Henry should be free to appoint his own ministers. The only concession made to the barons was a general pardon extended to those involved in the conflict. The financial demands of King Henry were not mentioned. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and was never likely to embrace the precedents set by the barons' infringement of Henry's authority. There was also the papal annulment to take into account, which the deeply pious Louis was not going to ignore. At the same time, Henry's wife Eleanor of Provencewho was Louis' sister-in-lawhad worked hard to procure a favourable decision for her husband. It was clear from the start though, that the French king had gone too far in his partisan decision, and that the settlement was little more than a dead letter. The settlement did not present a solution to the conflict, but rather a recipe for further problems. The one-sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but armed rebellion. Hostilities started already in February, when Montfort's sons, Henry and another Simon, attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches. Henry summoned the feudal army, and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton, where the younger Simon was captured. Montfort was still in control of London, as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex. Montfort marched out of London to negotiate, but the termsinvolving maintaining the provisionswere rejected by the king. The only option remaining was to fight, and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264. In spite of inferior numbers, the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle. Edward, commanding the right wing, quickly defeated the London forces. When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers, however, he left the rest of the royal army open to attack by the baronial forces, who soon won the day. By the settlement called the Mise of Lewes, the provisions were reinstated and Edward was given over as hostage. The government led by Montfort soon ran into problems. He negotiated a treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, an act that made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords. In May Edward escaped captivity, with the help of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who had now come over to the royal side. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle, and on 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, and by the end of the year the garrison surrendered. a. A \"mise\" in this context is a settlement by agreement. The use of the word in this sense is very rare in English, and is normally reserved for the Mise of Amiens and the Mise of Lewes from later the same year.

{"query": "Spring-heeled Jack origins and historical sightings instead of video game references", "pos": ["The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring Heeled Jack\nThe Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring Heeled Jack The Legend and Bizarre Crimes of Spring Heeled Jack is a non-fiction book by Peter Haining, published by Frederick Muller in 1977. It is notable for being the first full-length book about the Spring-heeled Jack legend, but is notorious for its numerous uncited claims and fabrications, being the earliest identifiable source of several elements of Spring-heeled Jack fakelore. The book begins by examining some of the earliest sightings of Spring-heeled Jack, suggesting that there may have been numerous culprits, including Henry de La Poer Beresford, the 'Mad' Marquess of Waterford. In later chapters it describes Spring-heeled Jack's transformation into a star of Victorian melodrama, before finally going on to explore some of the stranger theories about his identity, including the idea that he was a visitor from outer space. Researcher and historian Mike Dash, in his research article, \"Spring-heeled Jack: To Victorian Bugaboo from Suburban Ghost\", published in \"Fortean Studies, vol. 3\" (1996), identifies three key elements of the legend as described by Haining for which he was unable to find any prior record, leading him to conclude that they were all inventions on Haining's part. The first was the attack on farmer's daughter, 'Polly Adams', an uncorroborated incident which, according to Haining, occurred on 11 October 1837. As well as being a heavily fictionalised account of supposedly historical events, it asserts that 'Polly' was able to identify her attacker as a man she had seen earlier that evening; namely the Marquess of Waterford. The second is an embellishment of a documented attack on a servant boy at 2 Turner Street on 25 February 1838, of which Haining makes the claim that the boy reported seeing an initial 'W' in gold filigree on the folds of his assailant's cloak. Dash considers both of these examples as dubious attempts to bolster the popular theory that Spring-heeled Jack was indeed the Marquess of Waterford. The third episode, once again seemingly made up by Haining, is the alleged murder of thirteen-year-old prostitute, 'Maria Davis', in Folly Ditch, Jacob's Island on 12 November 1845. Dash goes on to reveal that he corresponded with Haining in 1996 in the hope of gaining access to his sources in order to corroborate his claims, but Haining was not able to furnish him with any, explaining that several years earlier he had lent all his research material to a scriptwriter and it had subsequently been lost.<br> <br>Cultural and social historian, Karl Bell, in \"The Legend of Spring-heeled Jack: Victorian urban folklore and popular cultures\" (Boydell Press, 2012), casts doubt on Haining's claim that the first proper dramatic treatment of Spring-heeled Jack was a play called \"Spring Heeled Jack, The Terror of London\", allegedly written by John Thomas Haines in 1840. While Haining claims that the play was 'an enormous success mainly because of the clever use of scenery and special effects', Bell can find no evidence of its existence, maintaining that plays featuring Spring-heeled Jack were rare until the 1860s. The character of Polly Adams and the murder of Maria Davis were both used in the audio drama series, \"The Springheel Saga\"."], "neg": ["Jack (hero)\nJack (hero) Jack is an archetypal Cornish and English hero and stock character appearing in legends, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes, generally portrayed as a young adult. Unlike moralizing fairy heroes, Jack is often portrayed as lazy or foolish, but through the use of cleverness and tricks he usually emerges triumphant. In this way, he may resemble a trickster. Some of the most famous are \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", \"Jack Frost\", \"Jack the Giant Killer\", \"Little Jack Horner\" and \"This Is the House That Jack Built\". While these heroes are not necessarily congruous, their concepts are related and in some instances interchangeable. The notion of \"Jack\" is closely related and sometimes identical to the English hero John. He also corresponds with the German Hans (or Hänsel) and the Russian Iván. \"Jack tales\" are also popular in Appalachian folklore. Richard Chase, an American Folklorist, collected in his book \"The Jack Tales\" many popular Appalachian Jack tales as told by descendants of Council Harmon. Council Harmon's grandfather, Cutliff Harmon, is thought to very possibly be the one who originally brought the Jack tales to America. As pointed out by folklorist Herbert Halpert, the Appalachian Jack tales are an oral tradition as opposed to written, and like many Appalachian folksongs, trace back to sources in England. For instance, where the English original would feature a king or other noble, the Appalachian Jack tale version would have a sheriff. Some stories feature Jack's brothers, Will and Tom. Some Jack tales feature themes that trace to Germanic folk tales."]}

This musical drama sweeps through a turbulent 40 years in popular singer Marika's (Sotiria Leonardou) life – and in the history of Greece – starting with the singer's birth in Smyrna, Turkey in 1917. Marika was deported to Greece along with all the other Greeks in Smyrna when she was seven years old, and a few years later, her parents started a career as a musician and a singer in a nightclub/bar. In the short space of one decade, Marika witnesses her father murder her mother, runs away from home, has a baby, and comes back to the nightclub to sing in an act with a childhood friend, Yorgos and a bouzouki player, Babis. Success finally comes at the expense of the suicide of another female singer at the club (named Rosa), but then Yorgos is exiled for political reasons, and she and Babis leave for other venues. Although Marika carries a torch for Babis, their relationship never seems to work out, and after many years and World War II go by, she sends her daughter away to a convent school (to later become a dancer in a cabaret, much to Marika's chagrin) and goes on a tour in America. She then returns to Greece to find herself supplanted by a younger singer named Matina who has caught the attention of Babis. Near the end of the movie, she is stabbed in the stomach the night of her reunion concert. Marika dies of her wounds and is buried by the people she sang with as they sing in her memory at the cemetery. There have been hypotheses that the story is based on the life of Marika Ninou with Babis playing the part of Vasilis Tsitsanis. However, there are glaring differences between the film and the real life of Marika Ninou. Marika Ninou only began singing after World War II. While she went to America, she never went with Vasilis Tsitsanis but in fact went with Kostas Kaplanis. She then returned to Greece and died of cancer. The film mentions a conflict with a singer named Rosa (Roza Eskenazi?)but no such incident has ever been documented. \"Rembetiko\" was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival in 1984, and won the Silver Bear.

They competed in two Football League competitions spread over the full season — the Lancashire Section, Northern Group Principal Competition, for thirty games, and then in the Lancashire Section, Group A, Subsidiary Competition, for a further six games. The club finished in 11th place in the principal competition and first in the subsidiary competition, which led to their appearance in the Lancashire Senior Cup. They lost to Liverpool at the semi-final (or first) stage by a single goal at Bloomfield Road. Bill Norman became Blackpool's first full-time manager prior to the start of the season. Thomas Hunter was, for the second consecutive season, the club's top scorer, with eighteen goals (fourteen in the principal competition and four in the subsidiary), including four in the penultimate game of the Principal Competition, a 6–0 victory at home to Southport Vulcan. The FA Cup was suspended for the duration of the war. As with the previous wartime seasons, Blackpool had to rely on a small nucleus of players supplemented by soldiers stationed in the town and the occasional league players as guests to make up the numbers. Again, they also had to rely on staff from the Royal Army Medical Corps Depot (RAMC) based at Squires Gate. Three of the players who made their debuts for the club in the 1918–19 season — Jimmy Heathcote, Harry Mingay and Eugene O'Doherty — went on to sign professional terms with the club for the 1919–20 season, as did Edmund Berry and Horace Fairhurst, who had made their debuts the previous season, as well as striker Thomas Hunter. The Principal competition for the 1917–18 season consisted of sixteen teams:  Blackpool began the campaign on 7 September 1918, with a home match against Oldham Athletic, which they lost 4–1, and Bolton completed the double over \"the Seasiders\" in the following match with a 2–1 win at Burnden Park on 14 September. As with previous wartime seasons, they found team selection a problem, and by the sixth game had used twenty different players. Against Port Vale on 28 September they had only ten players and had to borrow a player from the home side. They remained without a win in the first nine games (three draws and six losses), which saw them in last place, and it took until 9 November for their first victory, 3–1 at home to Oldham Athletic. They followed that up with a double over Blackburn Rovers, beating them at Ewood Park 3–0 on 16 November and then a week later at Bloomfield Road, 2–0. However, they followed this up with three consecutive defeats, and after a 5–1 win over Rochdale on 21 December, by mid-February 1919 they had won only two further games. Jimmy Heathcote, who was at the time a soldier based at the RAMC Depot, made his debut for the club on 8 February in a 1–1 draw at home to Burnley, a game which also saw the return of Horace Fairhurst. In the return fixture, another RAMC soldier, Harry Mingay, made his debut in goal in a 3–0 defeat. He was the club's goalkeeper for the final seven games of the season as they won five and lost two. Both he and Heathcote signed professional terms with the club at the end of the season. On 15 Mar Blackpool played Liverpool at Anfield, and although \"the Seasiders\" lost 3–1, the game was notable for its being played in front of the largest wartime crowd: 24,000. With five wins in six games, Blackpool moved off the bottom of the table and the club's directors declared: \"The appeal was made to them to favour us with three home victories has not been in vain, and they unselfishly threw in two away victories for make-weight. Truly they deserve our unstinting praise, which every Blackpool supporter will disperse individually and collectively.\" However, they ended the season with a 5–1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford and finished the season in 11th place, with Everton crowned champions. For the Subsidiary Competition, the Lancashire League was again divided into four, with the games played amalgamated at the end of the season to give a composite table. The winners of each group then competed in the Lancashire Senior Cup, with the winner of that going on to meet the winner of the Football League, Midland Section subsidiary tournament in a Championship play-off match. Blackpool were again placed in Group A which contained four teams: As with previous seasons, the first match in the Subsidiary Competition was held in the middle of the Principal Competition, with an away game at Burnley on Christmas Day, 1918, which they lost 5–1. It was to be their only defeat, and when the competition resumed in April 1919 they won three and drew two of the remaining five fixtures. On 5 April, they drew 1–1 with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in front of a crowd of 12,000, which Rovers described as their best gate since 1914. In the matchday programme for the return fixture on 12 April was the message, \"With pardonable pride we approach the Easter programme full of confidence and on the tip-toe of expectancy, for have we not three home games in a week? What a feast! 'The Rovers', 'Burnley' and 'North End' come to Bloomfield Road, gentlemen, so mark the occasion and line the ropes yards deep, after signifying your appreciation at the turnstiles. Then yell 'Blackpool' for all you're worth! And don't forget t'others!\" A crowd of 8,000 saw them achieve their largest victory of the season, 6–1. They followed that up on Good Friday, 18 April, with a 1–1 draw against Burnley in front of their first five-figure crowd of the wartime seasons, 12,000. The following day they beat Preston North End at Bloomfield Road 3–0 in front of a crowd of 10,000, and ended the'season on 26 April with a 2–0 win at Deepdale. As winners of Group C, they qualified along with the other three group winners — Oldham Athletic (Group B), Manchester City (Group C) and Liverpool (Group D) — for the Lancashire Senior Cup semi-finals. Blackpool met Liverpool in the semi-finals at Bloomfield Road on 24 May, with Liverpool winning 1–0. However, the game was overshadowed by controversy as many in the crowd of 7,000 felt that Blackpool had been \"over-refereed\", with claims that the official, Mr J. A. Alderston of Earlstown, distinctly favoured Liverpool, in particular when in the last few minutes of the game he denied what many thought was a clear penalty for Blackpool. At the final whistle, supporters demonstrated against the referee who had to be escorted off the pitch by police officers, as fans hurled sand and pieces of the turf at him. What was described as \"a large number of people\" stood outside the stand after the match and it took an appeal by the club's directors \"to disperse in the interests of the club\" before they left the ground. An official enquiry was launched, and the Lancashire County Football Association (LFA) appointed their president to chair it. The final hearing was held on 3 July when the referee, Mr Alderson was \"lightly reprimanded\" for not originally reporting the incident (he had not done so until instructed by members of the LFA who had been at the match); however, no action was taken against the club as the demonstration was deemed \"not to be of so serious a nature,\" although club director Albert Hargreaves was cautioned for \"making indscreet remarks\" about the officials in the referee's dressing room after the game. A mixed season saw Blackpool struggle in the Principal Competition, in which they only climbed off the foot of the table toward the end of the season to finish in 11th place. They won Group A of the Subsidiary Competition, however, and so qualified for the Lancashire Senior Cup semi-finals, in which the defeat to Liverpool, which caused controversy, saw the four-year period of wartime football draw to a close for the club. Harold Keenan made the most appearances, with 34 (28 in the Principal Competition and six in the Subsidiary Competition). Thomas Hunter was next, with 33 league appearances (27 in the Principal Competition and six in the Subsidiary Competition), followed by Bobby Booth, with 29 (23 in the Principal Competition and six in the Subsidiary Competition) and Eugene O'Doherty, with 27 (21 in the Principal Competition and six in the Subsidiary Competition). Over the four wartime seasons, Blackpool had used a total of 153 different players in the 145 official wartime games, plus at least another 21 in friendly games. Bobby Booth made the most appearances, playing in 88 official plus six other games. Jack Connor played in 76 official plus eight other games, Joe Bainbridge 73 plus four and Jimmy Jones 68 plus four. Of the soldiers who appeared, Dunn played in the most games, 59 plus five. Seven of the soldiers who had played for Blackpool in the wartime seasons went on to sign professional terms with the club — Edmund Berry, Horace Fairhurst, Jimmy Heathcote, Thomas Hunter, Henry Mingay, Albert Moorcroft and Eugene O'Doherty."], "neg": ["1923–24 Blackpool F.C. season\n1923–24 Blackpool F.C. season The 1923–24 season was Blackpool F.C.'s 23rd season (twentieth consecutive) in the Football League.

{"query": "Gambier Parry process technical details instead of artistic applications", "pos": ["Gambier Parry process\nGambier Parry process The Gambier Parry process is a development of the classical technique of fresco for painting murals, named for Thomas Gambier Parry. True fresco is the technique of painting on fresh lime plaster whereby the pigments are fixed by the carbonatation of the lime (calcium hydroxide). The technique requires no other binding medium and the fixing process produces a durable crystalline paint layer. However, only a limited range of pigments are suitable for true frescoes and the technique requires careful application under controlled conditions, and relatively low humidity thereafter. In some environments, conventional fresco colours can rapidly accumulate dirt and grime. The decoration of the new Houses of Parliament in the mid-nineteenth century saw an embarrassing failure of true fresco in England but had generated a revival in mural painting.  Gambier Parry developed a spirit medium for use on a specially prepared plaster or canvas ground and in 1862 he published his recipe. Originally it used beeswax, oil of spike lavender, spirits of turpentine, elemi resin and copal varnish, and was complex both in preparing the wall surface and applying the paint. With commercialisation the process was simplified and became widely known. The system was used by Frederic Leighton for \"The Arts of Industry as Applied to War\" and \"The Arts of Industry as Applied to Peace\" at the Victoria & Albert Museum (1870-72) and by Ford Madox Brown on the \"Manchester Murals\" in Manchester Town Hall (1879-93). One of the most complete examples of the Gambier Parry process may be seen at St Leonard's Church, Newland, Worcestershire where frescoes cover the interior of the church; St Leonard's is the private chapel of the Beauchamp Almshouses."], "neg": ["Gyropalette\nGyropalette A gyropalette is a piece of equipment used in the production of sparkling wine, such as Champagne, made by the traditional method, where the second fermentation takes place in the bottle. In order to remove the yeast sediment (\"lees\") left in the bottle after the fermentation, \"riddling\" (or in French \"remuage\") is performed. At certain intervals, the bottle is twisted, shaken slightly and moved progressively to a vertical position with the neck pointing down. Traditionally, this used to take place manually over the course of several weeks, with wine cellar workers called \"remueurs\" performing the task on each individual bottle. A gyropalette performs the same task automatically on many bottles at the same time, and in a shorter period of time. The bottles are placed in a cage, and are moved in a way which emulates the action of a remueur by means of motors and automatic controls. The gyropalette was invented by two French vintners, Claude Cazals and Jacques Ducion, who filed for patent in 1968, but was first introduced in Spain in the mid-1970s with Cava-producer Codorníu as the first big user. Most sparkling wines produced by the traditional method, including most Champagne, is now produced using gyropalettes. The manual method is still used for some high-end wines."]}

{"query": "Rishabhadatta's administration as viceroy instead of his charities and conquests.", "pos": ["Viceroy\nViceroy A viceroy () is an official who runs a country, colony, city, province, or sub-national state, in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory. The term derives from the Latin prefix \"vice-\", meaning \"in the place of\" and the French word \"roy\", meaning \"king\". A viceroy's territory may be called a viceroyalty, though this term is not always applied. The adjective form is viceregal, less often viceroyal. The term vicereine is sometimes used to indicate a female viceroy \"suo jure\", although viceroy can serve as a gender-neutral term. Vicereine is more commonly used to indicate a viceroy's wife. \"Viceroy\" is a form of royal appointment rather than noble rank. An individual viceroy often also held a noble title, however, such as Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma who was also Viceroy of India. The title was originally used by the Crown of Aragon; where beginning in the 14th century, it referred to the Spanish governors of Sardinia and Corsica. After the unification, at the end of the 15th century, later kings of Spain came to appoint numerous viceroys to rule over various parts of the increasingly vast Spanish Empire in Europe, the Americas, and overseas elsewhere. In Europe, until the 18th century, the Habsburg crown appointed viceroys of Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, Navarre, Portugal, Sardinia, Sicily, and Naples. With the ascension of the House of Bourbon to the Spanish throne, the historic Aragonese viceroyalties were replaced by new captaincies general. At the end of War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish monarchy was shorn of its Italian possessions. These Italian territories, however, continued to have viceroys under their new rulers for some time; Sardinia would have a viceroy until 1848.  The Americas were incorporated into the Crown of Castile. With the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the institution of viceroys was adapted to govern the highly populated and wealthy regions of the north overseas: New Spain (Mexico and Philippines) and the south overseas: Peru and South America. The viceroys of these two areas had oversight over the other provinces, with most of the North American, Central American, Caribbean and East Indian areas supervised by the viceroy in Mexico City and the South American ones by the viceroy in Lima, (with the exception of most of today's Venezuela, which was overseen by the high court, or Audiencia of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola for most of the colonial period). These large administrative territories became known as \"Viceroyalties\" (Spanish term: \"Virreinatos\"). There were only two New World viceroyalties until the 18th century, when the new Bourbon Dynasty established two additional viceroyalties to promote economic growth and new settlements on South America. New viceroyalties were created for New Granada in 1717 (capital, Bogotá) and the Río de la Plata in 1776 (capital, Buenos Aires). The viceroyalties of the Spanish Americas and the Spanish East Indies were subdivided into smaller, autonomous units, the Audiencias (tribunal with the authority to judge), and the Captaincies General (military districts), which in most cases became the bases for the independent countries of modern Hispanic America. These units gathered the local provinces which could be governed by either a crown official, a corregidor (sometimes \"alcalde mayor\") or by a cabildo or town council. Audiencias primarily functioned as superior judicial tribunals, but unlike their European counterparts, the New World audiencias were granted by law both administrative and legislative powers. Captaincies General were primarily military districts set up in areas with a risk of foreign or Indian attack, but the captains general were usually given political powers over the provinces under their command. Because the long distances to the viceregal capital would hamper effective communication, both audiencias and captains general were authorized to communicate directly with the crown through the Council of the Indies. The Bourbon Reforms introduced the new office of the intendant, which was appointed directly by the crown and had broad fiscal and administrative powers in political and military issues. See also: The title of Viceroy being awarded to members of the nobility, Viceroys, Governors and Governing Commissions were many times interleaved until the last Viceroy Afonso, Prince Royal of Portugal, in 1896. From 1505 to 1896 Portuguese India – the name \"India\" and the official name \"Estado da India\" (\"State of India\") including all Portuguese possessions in the Indian Ocean, from southern Africa to Southeast Asia and Australasia, until 1752- was governed either by a Viceroy (Portuguese \"Vice-Rei\") or Governor from its headquarters, in Goa since 1510. The government started six years after the discovery of sea route to India by Vasco da Gama, in 1505, under first Viceroy Francisco de Almeida (b.1450–d.1510). Initially, King Manuel I of Portugal tried a power distribution with three governors in different areas of jurisdiction: a government covering the area and possessions in East Africa, Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf, overseeing up Cambay (Gujarat); a second one ruling the possessions in India (Hindustan) and Ceylon, and a third one from Malacca to the Far East. However the post was centered by governor Afonso de Albuquerque (1509–1515), who became plenipotentiary, and remained so. The duration in office was usually three years, possibly longer, given the power represented: of the thirty-four governors of India in the 16th century, only six had longer mandates. During some periods of the Iberian Union, between 1580 and 1640, the King of Spain, who was also King of Portugal, appointed Viceroys to govern Portugal itself, as the king had multiple realms throughout Europe and delegated his powers to various viceroys. After the end of the Iberian Union in 1640, the governors of Brazil that were members of the Portuguese high nobility started to use the title of Viceroy. Brazil became a permanent Viceroyalty in 1763, when the capital of the State of Brazil (\"Estado do Brasil\") was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. Following adoption of the Government of India Act 1858, which transferred control of India from the British East India Company to the British Crown, the Governor-General as representing the Crown became known as the Viceroy. The designation \"Viceroy,\" although it was most frequently used in ordinary parlance, had no statutory authority, and was never employed by Parliament. Although the Proclamation of 1858 announcing the assumption of the government of India by the Crown referred to Lord Canning as \"first Viceroy and Governor-General,\" none of the Warrants appointing his successors referred to them as \"viceroys,\" and the title, which was frequently used in warrants dealing with precedence and in public notifications, was basically one of ceremony used in connection with the state and social functions of the sovereign's representative. The Governor-General continued to be the sole representative of the Crown, and the Government of India continued to be vested in the Governor-General-in-Council. The viceroys reported directly to the Secretary of State for India in London and were advised by the Council of India. They were largely unencumbered in the exercise of their authority and were among the most powerful men on earth in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, ruling over an entire subcontinent with a large military force at their disposal in the form of the British Indian Army. Under the terms of the Government of India Act 1919, viceroys shared some limited aspects of their authority with the Central Legislative Assembly, one of the first steps in the establishment of Indian home rule. This process was accelerated by the Government of India Act 1935 and ultimately led to the independence of India and Pakistan as dominions in 1947. Both countries finally severed complete ties with Britain when they became republics – India as a secular republic in 1950 and Pakistan as an Islamic republic in 1956. Alongside the Commander-in-Chief, India, the viceroy was the public face of the British presence in India, attending to many ceremonial functions as well as political affairs. As the representative of the Emperors and Empresses of India, who were also the kings and queens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the viceroy served as the grand master of the two principal chivalric orders of British India: the Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire. During the office's history, the Governors-General of India were based in two cities: Calcutta during the 19th century and New Delhi during the 20th century. Additionally, whilst Calcutta was the capital of British India, the viceroys spent the summer months at Simla. The two historic residences of the viceroys still stand: the Viceroy's House in New Delhi and Government House in Calcutta. They are used today as the official residences of the President of India and the Governor of West Bengal, respectively. The portraits of the Governors-General still hang in a room on the ground floor of the Presidential Palace, one of the last vestiges of both the viceroys and the British Raj. Notable Governors-General of India include Warren Hastings, Lord Cornwallis, Lord Curzon, The Earl of Minto, Lord Chelmsford, and Lord Mountbatten. Lord Mountbatten served as the last Viceroy of British India, but continued on as the first Governor-General of the dominion of India. The Lords Lieutenant of Ireland were often referred to as \"Viceroy\" after 1700 until 1922, even though the Kingdom of Ireland had been merged in 1801 into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The term has occasionally been applied to the governors-general of the Commonwealth Realms, for example Gough Whitlam in 1973 told the Australian House of Representatives: 'The Governor-General is the viceroy of the Queen of Australia'. The governor general of Canada, the lieutenant governors of the Canadian provinces and the governors-general of Australia and governors of the Australian states are viceroys in terms of the Balfour Declaration of 1926. The Australia Act 1986 also provide that all royal powers in Australia, except the actual appointment of the governor-general and the governors are exercisable by the viceregal representatives. The noun 'viceroy' is rarely used but the adjective 'viceregal' is standard usage.  Namestnik (, ) was an office position in the history of the Russian Empire. It can be translated as \"viceroy\", \"deputy\", \"lieutenant\" (the broader sense of that word) or literally \"in place appointee\". The term has two periods of usage, with different meanings. Namestnik replaced the obsolete position of voyevoda (ruler of krai or uyezd) by Peter I.  The Tsar Paul I's 1799 formation of the Russian-American Company obviated viceroys in the colonization of the northwestern New World. New France, in present Canada, after a single Governor (24 July 1534 – 15 January 1541 Jacques Cartier) had Lieutenants-general and Viceroys 15 January 1541 – September 1543 Jean François de la Rocquet, sieur de Robervalle ( 1500 – 1560), after September 1543 – 3 January 1578 Abandonment again 3 January 1578 – February 1606 Troilus de Mesgouez, marquis de la Roche-Mesgouez (died 1606) (viceroy and from 12 January 1598, lieutenant-general), February 1606 – 1614 Jean de Biencourt, sieur de Poutrincourt, baron de St. Just (1557–1615); next a series of \"Viceroys\" (resident in France) 8 October 1611 – 1672, later Governors and Governors-general. In Italian \"Viceré\": The highest colonial representatives in the \"federation\" of Italian East Africa (six provinces, each under a governor; together Ethiopia, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland) were no longer styled \"High Commissioner\", but \"Viceroy and Governor-general\" from 5 May 1936, when Italian forces occupied Ethiopia, until 27 November 1941, when the last Italian administrator surrendered to the Allies. The Italian King Victor Emmanuel claimed the title of \"Emperor of Ethiopia\" (Nəgusä nägäst, \"King of Kings\") and declared himself to be a successor to the Nəgusä nägäst, even though Emperor Haile Selassie I continued to hold this title while in exile, and resumed his actual, physical throne on 5 May 1941. On 7 April 1939, Italy invaded the Kingdom of Albania (today Albania). As Viceré of Albania of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy were the Marchese Francesco Jacomoni di San Savino and after his departure General Alberto Pariani. Ban Borić was the first ruler and Viceroy of Bosnia, appointed by Géza II of Hungary by 1154. His war affairs are documented as he fought several notable battles. He also maintained ties with knights Templar and donated lands in Bosnia and Slavonia to their Order. His own biological brother Dominic was on record as a knight Templar. From the earliest medieval period in the Kingdom of Croatia, the position of viceroy was held by Ban of Croatia who acted as king's representative in Croatian lands and supreme commander of Croatian army. In the 18th century, Croatian bans eventually become chief government officials in Croatia. They were at the head of Ban's Government, effectively the first prime ministers of Croatia. The last ban held his position until 1941 and the collapse of Yugoslavia in World War II. An equivalent office, called the Exarch, was created in the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire towards the end of the sixth century for governors of important areas too far from the imperial capital of Constantinople to receive regular instruction or reinforcement. The chosen governors of these provinces were empowered to act in place of the monarch (hence ex-arch) with more discretion and autonomy than was granted other categories of governor. This was an extraordinary break from the centralized traditions of the Roman Empire and was an early example of the principle of Viceroyalty. As with many princely and administrative titles, viceroy is often used, generally unofficially, to render somewhat equivalent titles and offices in non-western cultures. In cultures all over the continent of Africa, the role of viceroy has been subsumed into a hereditary noble as opposed to strictly administrative position. In the Arabo-Berber north, for example, the title of Khalifa is often used by individuals who derive their authority to rule from someone else in much the same way as a viceroy would. Elsewhere, subordinate inkosis under the rule of a paramount chief like the King of the Zulu Nation of Southern Africa or subordinate baales in the realms of the reigning obas of West African Yorubaland continue to occupy statutorily recognized positions in the contemporary countries of South Africa and Nigeria as the customary representatives of their respective principals in the various areas that are under their immediate control. Marathas from the time of Shivaji  sent various empire insiders to run foreign parts such as Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madya Pradesh and Andra Paradesh, where the Maratha empire extended. The Khedive of Egypt, especially during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805–1848). This officer established an almost autonomous regime in Egypt, which officially still was under Ottoman rule. Although Mehemet Ali/Muhammad Ali used different symbols to mark his independence from the Sublime Porte, he never openly declared himself independent. Adopting the title of viceroy was yet another way to walk the thin line between challenging the Sultan's power explicitly and respecting his jurisdiction. Muhammad Ali Pasha's grandson, Ismail Pasha, subsequently received the title of Khedive which was almost an equivalent to viceroy. The post of Tổng Trấn (\"governor of all military provinces\") was a political post in the early period of the Vietnamese Nguyễn Dynasty (1802–1830). From 1802, under the reign of emperor Gia Long, there were two \"Tổng Trấn\" who administered Vietnam's northern part named Bắc thành with administrative center in Hanoi and the southern part Gia Định thành with administrative center in Gia Định, while Nguyen emperors ruled only the central region Kinh Kỳ from capital Phú Xuân. \"Tổng Trấn\" is sometimes translated to English as viceroy. In 1830, emperor Minh Mạng abolished the post in order to increase the imperial direct ruling power in all over Vietnam. During the Han, Ming and Qing dynasties, there existed positions of viceroys having control over various provinces (e.g., Liangguang = Guangdong and Guangxi, Huguang = Hubei and Hunan). In Siam before 1885, the title was used for the heir-apparent or heir presumptive (Thai: กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานมงคล) The title was abolished and replaced with that of the Crown Prince of Siam."], "neg": ["Gujarat under Jehangir\nGujarat under Jehangir The Mughal Empire's province Gujarat to the west of the Indian peninsula, was managed by the Viceroys appointed by the emperors.

In 1602, Mírza Âzíz sent his eldest son Shádmán as deputy; his second son Khurram as governor of Junagadh; and Sayad Báyazíd as minister. Khurram was afterwards relieved of the charge of Sorath and Junagaḍh by his brother Abdulláh. In 1605, Jehangir succeeded Akbar to the imperial throne. Shortly after his accession, Jehangir published a decree remitting certain taxes, and also in cases of robbery fixing the responsibility on the landowners of the place where the robbery was committed. The decree also renewed Akbar's decree forbidding soldiers billetting themselves forcibly in cultivators' houses. Finally it directed that dispensaries and hospital wards should be opened in all large towns. In the early days of Jehángír's reign disturbance was caused in the neighbourhood of Áhmedábád by Bahádur a son of Muzaffar Sháh. Jehángír despatched Patrdás Rája Vikramájit as viceroy of Gujarát to put down the rising. The Rája’s arrival at Áhmedábád restored order. Some of the rebel officers submitting were reinstated in their commands: the rest fled to the hills. On the Rája’s return Jehángír appointed Kalíj Khán to be viceroy of Gujarát; but Kalíj Khán never joined his charge, allowing Mírza Âzíz Kokaltásh to act in his place. In 1606, on the transfer of Mírza Âzíz to the Lahore viceroyalty, Sayad Murtaza Khán Bukhári, who had recently been ennobled in consequence of crushing the rebellion under Jehángír’s son Khusrao, was entrusted with the charge of Gujarát, Sayad Báyazíd being continued as minister. Sayad Murtaza, who is said to have further ingratiated himself with the emperor by the present of a magnificent ruby, appears to have been more of a scholar than a governor. His only notable acts were the repair of the fort of Kadi and the populating of the Bukhára quarter of Ahmedabad. During his tenure of power disturbances broke out, and Rái Gopináth, son of Rája Todar Mal, with Rája Sursingh of Jodhpur, were sent to Gujarát by way of Malwa, Surat and Baroda. They overcame and imprisoned Kalián, chief of Belpár, but were defeated by the Mándwa chieftain, and withdrew to Áhmedábád. Rái Gopináth, obtaining reinforcements, returned to Mándwa and succeeded in capturing the chief. He then marched against the rebellious Kolis of the Kánkrej, and took prisoner their leader, whom, on promising not to stir up future rebellions, he afterwards restored to liberty. The first connection of the English with Gujarát dates from Sayad Murtaza’s viceroyalty. In 1608, he allowed Captain Hawkins to sell goods in Surat. In 1609, the Khán-i-Ázam Mírza Âzíz Kokaltásh was for the fourth time appointed viceroy of Gujarát. He was allowed to remain at court and send his son Jehángír Kúli Khán as his deputy with Mohandás Diván and Masûd Beg Hamadáni. This was the beginning of government by deputy, a custom which in later times proved problematic to the Mughal interests. In 1609 Malik Âmbar, chief minister of Nizám Sháh’s court and governor of Daulatabad, invaded Gujarát at the head of 50,000 horse, and after plundering both the Surat and Baroda districts retired as quickly as he came. To prevent such raids a body of 25,000 men was posted at Rámnagar (near Dharampur) on the Dakhan (Deccan) frontier, and remained there for four years. This force included 4000 men from the Viceroy of Áhmedábád, 5000 men from the Nobles of his Court, 3000 men from Baglan, 2500 men from the son of the chief of Cutch, 2500 men from Nawanagar, 2000 from Idar, 2000 from Dungarpur, 2000 from Banswada, 1000 from Ramnagar of Dharampur, 1000 from Rajpipla, 300 from Ali, 350 from Mohan (Chhota Udaipur. In 1611, Abdulláh Khán Bahádur Fírúz Jang was appointed thirteenth viceroy of Gujarát, with Ghiás-ud-dín as his minister, under orders to proceed to the Dakhan (Deccan) to avenge the recent inroad. The viceroy marched to the Dakhan (Deccan) but returned without effecting anything. In 1616, he was again, in company with prince Shah Jahan, directed to move against Ahmednagar. This second expedition was successful. The country was humbled, and, except Malik Ambar, most of the nobles submitted to the emperor. During this viceroy’s term of office an imperial decree was issued forbidding nobles on the frontiers and in distant provinces to affix their seals to any communications addressed to Mughal servants. In 1611, the English East India Company sent vessels to trade with Surat. The Portuguese made an armed resistance, but were defeated. The Mughal commander, who was not sorry to see the Portuguese beaten, gave the English a warm reception. In 1612–13, a factory was opened in Surat by the English, and in 1614 a fleet was kept in the Tápti river under Captain Downton to protect the factory. In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came as ambassador to the emperor Jehángír, and obtained permission to establish factories, not only at Surat but also at Bharuch, Cambay and Ghogha. The factory at Ghogha seems to have been established in 1613. The emperor Jehángír notes in his memoirs that Mukarrab Khán, viceroy from 1616–1618, regardless of cost had bought from the English at Ghogha a turkey, a lemur and other curiosities. On his return from Jehángír’s camp at Ahmedabad in January 1618, Roe obtained valuable concessions from the viceroy. The governor of Surat was to lend ships to the English, the resident English might carry arms, build a house, practise their religion, and settle their disputes. The Dutch closely followed the English at Surat and were established there in 1618. In 1616, on their return to Delhi, Mukarrab Khán, a surgeon who had risen to notice by curing the emperor Akbar and was ennobled by Jehángír, and who, since 1608, had been in charge of Surat or of Cambay, was appointed fourteenth viceroy of Gujarát, with Muhammad Safi as his minister. In the following year (1617), the emperor Jehángír came to Gujarát to hunt wild elephants in the Dahod forests. But owing to the density of the forest only twelve were captured. Early in 1618, he visited Cambay which he notes only vessels of small draught could reach and where he ordered a gold and silver tanka twenty times heavier than the gold mohar to be minted. From Cambay, after a stay of ten days, he went to Áhmedábád in hot season of March 1618 and received the Rája of Ídar. In his memoir, he contented himself with abusing its sandy streets, calling the city the ‘abode of dust’ (\"gardábád\"). After an attack of fever his dislike grew stronger, and he was uncertain whether the ‘home of the simoom’ (\"samumistán\"), the ‘place of sickness’ (\"bímáristán\"), the ‘thorn brake’ (\"zakumdár\"), or ‘hell’ (\"jahánnamábád\"), was its most fitting name. Even the last title did not satisfy his dislike. In derision he adds the verse, \"Oh essence of all goodnesses by what name shall I call thee.\" Of the old buildings of Áhmedábád, the emperor speaks of the Kankaria Lake and its island garden and of the royal palaces in the Bhadra. He notes that his Bakhshi had repaired the Kánkaria lake and that the viceroy Mukarrab Khán had partly restored the Bhadra palaces against his arrival. The emperor was disappointed with the capital. After the accounts he had heard it seemed rather poor with its narrow streets, its shops with ignoble fronts, and its dust, though to greet the emperor as he came on elephant-back scattering gold the city and its population had put on their holiday dress. The emperor speaks of having met some of the great men of Gujarát. Chief among these was Sayad Muhammad Bukhári the representative of Sháh-i-Álam and the sons of Sháh Wajíh-ud-dín of Áhmedábád. They came as far as Cambay to meet the emperor. After his arrival in the capital Jehángír with great kindness informally visited the house and garden of Sikandar Gujaráti the author of the \"Mirăt-i-Sikandari\", to pick some of the author’s famous figs off the trees. Jehángír speaks of the historian as a man of a refined literary style well versed in all matters of Gujarát history, who six or seven years since had entered the imperial service. On the occasion of celebrating Sháh Jehán’s twenty-seventh birthday at Áhmedábád, Jehángír records having granted the territory from Mandu to Cambay as the estate of his son Shah Jahan (Prince Khurram). Before leaving Gujarát the emperor ordered the expulsion of the Sevadas or Jain priests, because of a prophecy unfavourable to him made by Mán Sing Sewda. As the climate of Áhmedábád disagreed with him, Jehángír retired to the banks of the Mahi river. Here the Jám of Nawanagar State came to pay homage, and presented fifty Kutch horses, a hundred gold mohars, and a hundred rupees, and received a dress of honour. The emperor now returned to Áhmedábád, where he was visited by Rái Bharmalji of Kutch, who presented 100 Kutchi horses, 100 \"ashrafi\"s and 2000 rupees. The Rái, who was ninety years of age, had never paid his respects to any emperor. Jehángír, much pleased with the greatest of Gujarát Zamíndárs, who, in spite of his ninety years was hale and in full possession of all his senses, gave him his own horse, a male and female elephant, a dagger, a sword with diamond-mounted hilt, and four rings of different coloured precious stones. As he still suffered from the climate, the emperor set out to return to Agra, and just at that time (1618–19) he heard of the birth of a grandson, Aurangzeb who was born at Dahod in Gujarát. In honour of this event Sháh Jehán held a great festival at Ujjain. Before the emperor started for Ágra, he appointed prince Shah Jahan fifteenth viceroy of Gujarát in the place of Mukarrab Khán. Muhammad Safi was continued as minister. As Sháh Jahán preferred remaining at Ujjain, he chose Rustam Khán as his deputy; but the emperor, disapproving of this choice, selected Rája Vikramájit in Rustam Khán’s stead. Shortly after, in 1622–23, Sháh Jahán rebelled, and in one of the battles which took place Rája Vikramájit was killed. Sháh Jahán, during his viceroyalty, built the Sháhi Bágh and the royal baths in the Bhadra at Áhmedábád. After the death of Vikramájit, his brother succeeded as deputy viceroy. While Sháh Jahán was still in rebellion, the emperor appointed Sultán Dáwar Baksh, the son of prince Khusrau, sixteenth viceroy of Gujarát, Muhammad Safi being retained in his post of minister. Sháh Jahán, who was then at Mándu in Malwa, appointed on his part Abdulláh Khán Bahádur Fírúz Jang viceroy and a \"khájahsara\" or eunuch of Abdulláh Khán his minister. Sultán Dáwar Baksh, the emperor’s nominee, was accompanied by Khán-i-Ázam Mírza Âzíz Kokaltásh to instruct him in the management of affairs. Prince Sháh Jahán had directed his minister to carry away all the treasure; but Muhammad Safi, who appears to have been a man of great ability, at once imprisoned the prince’s partisans in Áhmedábád, and, among others, captured the eunuch of Abdulláh Khán. When this news reached the prince at Mándu, he sent Abdulláh Khán Bahádur with an army to Gujarát by way of Baroda. Muhammad Safi Khán met and defeated him, and forced him to fly and rejoin the prince at Mándu. For his gallant conduct Muhammad Safi received the title of Saif Khán, with an increase in his monthly pay from Rupees 700 to 3000 and the command of 3000 horse. Meanwhile, Sultán Dáwar Baksh, with the Khán-i-Ázam, arrived and assumed the charge of the government, but the Khán-i-Ázam died soon after in 1624, and was buried at Sarkhej. Sultán Dáwar Baksh was re-called, and Khán Jahán was appointed deputy viceroy with Yúsuf Khán as his minister. On his arrival at Áhmedábád, prince Sháh Jahán employed Khán Jahán in his own service, and sent him as his ambassador to the emperor. Saif Khán, who acted for him, may be called the seventeenth viceroy, as indeed he had been the governing spirit for the last eight or ten years. He held the post of viceroy of Gujarát until the death of the Jahangir in 1627."]}

Several theories exist as to its origins and etymology. The prevailing belief is that the name has Galician origins. The surname is most common in Spain and Latin American countries, including Colombia and Mexico. The surname may have originated as a toponym for the town of Muxia in Galicia, an autonomous community in north-western Spain. Another idea is that the word \"Mexia\" used to mean \"medicine\" in an old variant of Spanish, and that this is where the surname came from. One common belief is that the name may have Sephardic origins, from when the Spanish Kingdom forced Jewish settlers to change their surname to Castillian. The translation of the surname for \"Messiah\" would then become the name \"Mesía\". However, the Spanish people who travelled to the Spanish colonies in South America were not allowed to be Jewish or to have any Jewish or Muslim ancestors, and thus this explanation may not account for the popularity of the surname in modern-day Latin America. Note that \"Mexía\" is the older Spanish spelling of the name. In the modern orthography of Spain, the spelling is \"Mejía\", though in Mexico the older orthography is still considered correct. (Similarly, until recently Spaniards rendered the country name \"Méjico\" rather than \"México\", though this has reversed in recent decades out of deference to Mexico). As of 2014, 23.7% of all known bearers of the surname \"Mejía\" were residents of Mexico (frequency 1:450), 16.2% of Colombia (1:253), 14.4% of Honduras (1:53), 8.0% of Guatemala (1:172), 6.5% of the Dominican Republic (1:138), 6.3% of the United States (1:4,915), 6.3% of El Salvador (1:86), 4.7% of Peru (1:583), 2.9% of Ecuador (1:475), 2.8% of Nicaragua (1:185), 2.5% of the Philippines (1:3,461), 2.0% of Venezuela (1:1,266) and 1.8% of Bolivia (1:510).

It is the largest power plant that Dominion operates. The facility's three units use around 15,000 tons of coal to generate more than 1,600 megawatts of electricity from the coal synfuel for around 2 million people in Northern Virginia. Mount Storm Power Station was engineered and built by Stone & Webster, an American engineering service company from Massachusetts. They built Mount Storm's first coal plant unit in September 1965, the second unit soon after in June 1966, and the third unit in December 1973. During the first few decades that the station existed, the hazard of fly ash was a big problem for the employees of Mount Storm Power Station as well as for the people living in the surrounding communities. These people were constantly exposed to the asbestos not even knowing of its existence. It was not till the 1970s where rules were passed to regulate the exposure of these toxicants. Due to the lack of regulation, people who worked in the power station prior to 1980 have been diagnosed with \"asbestos-related illnesses, including asbestosis and the much more deadly mesothelioma.\" Since then Mount Storm Power Station has kept up with all government regulations and now catches most all of the toxicants produced by burning the coal before it can harm the employees or the surrounding community. Mount Storm has limestone scrubbers in the burners which removes up to 95% of the sulfur dioxide emitted by the station. Dominion states that Mount Storm Power Station exceeds the regulations set by the West Virginia regulators. Mount Storm Lake is a reservoir created for Mount Storm Power Station along the Stony River. This lake is 1,200 acres and is used as a cooling pond for the power station. The power station sucks up approximately 234,000 gallons of water from the lake per minute to cool down the turbines. This results in the entire lake being sucked up and recycled in just 2.5 days. Due to this cooling process, Mount Storm Lake is warm all year around. \"Even when winter temperatures are below freezing, the water temperature in the lake seldom drops below 60 degrees F. This makes the lake an attractive year-round destination for scuba divers, boaters and fishermen.\" However, some people are resistant to participate in these water activities due to the proximity to the coal-fired station. Due to the year round cooling process,the warm water has an effect on the environment called Thermal Pollution. Thermal pollution is defined as \"a rise in the temperature of rivers and lakes that is injurious to water-dwelling life, and is caused by the disposal of heated industrial waste water.\" One effect of thermal pollution is that it reduces the levels of Dissolved Oxygen in the water. The dissolved oxygen reduces the amount of oxygen in the water that plants and animals need to survive. Warm water also provokes the spread of algae in the water which can also reduce levels of oxygen. Another effect that thermal pollution has on the environment is it increases the metabolic rate of organisms. \"Increasing enzyme activity occurs that causes organisms to consume more food than what is normally required... It disrupts the stability of the food chain and (can) alter the balance of species composition.\" Dominion Resources maintains restrictions on activities permitted for visitors to the lake. Mount Storm also includes Ned power Mount Storm, LLC which is a nearby wind farm with 132 wind turbines, of which Dominion owns half of them. These wind turbines are placed along 12 miles of the Allegheny Front. The wind farm began construction in 2006 and is now currently fully operational. The wind generates up to 264MW of electricity which is enough to power 66,000 homes."]}

The Satomi moved from Kōzuke Province in present-day Gunma Prefecture to Awa Province in present-day southern Chiba Prefecture in the mid-15th century. From this period the clan became known as the Awa Satomi clan. During the Sengoku period the Satomi were forced to submit to the overlordship of Hōjō Ujitsuna in 1539. The remainder of the period saw the clan battle the Later Hōjō, Takeda, and Imagawa clans. The Satomi were involved in the First Battle of Kōnodai (1538) and the Second Battle of Kōnodai (1564). The Satomi fought under both Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu. At the beginning of the Edo period the clan was named the \"daimyō\" of Awa Province with a holding of 120,000 \"koku\". The Satomi fell afoul of the Tokugawa shogunate early in the Edo period. The clan was implicated in the Ōkubo Nagayasu Incident of 1614.

The castle is rebuilt by his son, Satomi Yoshiyasu in 1588, who also built a fortified residence, or \"jinya\" at Katsuyama, and what is now part of the city of Kamogawa to protect the northeastern approaches to Tateyama Castle. Following the Battle of Odawara in 1590, the Kantō region was assigned to Tokugawa Ieyasu, who confirmed the Satomi as daimyō of Awa and Kazusa Provinces, with revenues of 92,000 \"koku\".

Rogers wrote four books, titled \"Walking the Tightrope: the private confessions of a public relations man\", \"Rogers' Rules for Success\", \"The One-Hat Solution: Rogers' Strategy for Creative Middle Management\", and \"Rogers' Rules for Businesswomen: How to Start a Career and Move Up the Ladder\". Henry Rogers was born in Irvington, N.J., where his father operated a dry goods store. Rogers was destined to take over his father's dry goods store in New Jersey. He attended the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, but when his father's store began to fail during the Depression, he had to drop out of school two and a half years into his program. It was January 1934 that he left Penn and enrolled in classes at New York University School of Commerce. Rogers worked 5 days a week at the store, and took classes in the evening. The summer of 1934 his family went bankrupt. On October 1, 1934, they left for Los Angeles, California to join his older sister who had moved with her lawyer husband two years before. He was married to Rosalind Rogers in 1937, and they had one son, Ron, and one daughter, Marcia Ross. Rogers died on April 28, 1995, due to a combination of longstanding heart and kidney problems. At that point, he had worked in the public relations business for 50 years. In promoting the arts, Rogers served as chairman of the Center Theatre Group and was a board member of the Performing Arts Council of the Los Angeles County Music Center, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the American Council for the Arts. He was a vice chairman of the American Film Institute and chairman of an advisory committee to the U.S. Information Agency. He also served on the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. After much trouble finding work, Rogers began his career in 1934 as a $5-a-week press agent's office boy for Grace Nolan, a Hollywood press agent. After working for Nolan for a while, Rogers was promoted to $12 an hour. It was then that he began meeting people in the movie business. Rogers was fired after accidentally taking home his boss' keys and causing her to miss an appointment. When the job ended, Rogers, then 21, borrowed $500 from his father to set up his own business in 1935. His first clients were nightclubs and restaurants, which paid little but enabled him to tell the columnists which stars had been seen on the premises. It helped the clients; it also got Rogers better known. Henry Rogers founded his own independent public relations firm in 1935. In 1950, 15 years into the business, he partnered with Warren Cowan and changed the name of the firm to Rogers and Cowan.

Lowenstein was hired to manage this office and described Rogers as a \"micromanager.\" Lowenstein described him as wanting things done his way no matter how unrealistic the expectations, and he didn't want to hear about the realities of New York media operations versus Hollywood operations. Charles Champin of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"[I]n 1965, Rogers & Cowan was the powerhouse among independent publicity agencies servicing the entertainment industry.\" This was attributed to the shrinking of the major studios in the growth years of television, and the decimating of the studio publicity staffs in particular, which had created boom times for the independents.

Maxwell occupied himself a number of activities, selling curios and offering to guide visitors to the port.

Jadzia Dax is a joined Trill. Though she appears to be a young woman, Jadzia lives in symbiosis with a wise and long-lived creature, known as a symbiont, named Dax. The two share a single, conscious mind, and her personality is a blending of the characteristics of both the host and the symbiont. As such, Jadzia has access to all the skills and memories of the symbiont's seven previous hosts. Jadzia holds academic degrees in exobiology, zoology, astrophysics and exoarchaeology, all of which she earned before the joining. Jadzia Dax is the station's chief science officer, and is close friends with commander Benjamin Sisko and Bajoran first officer Kira Nerys. Later in the series, she becomes involved with the Klingon character Worf, and they marry during the sixth season of the show. Her character is killed by Gul Dukat during the sixth-season finale (due to Farrell's desire for a reduced role so that she could have time for other things, which producer Rick Berman refused to allow). The character of Dax re-emerges in the seventh-season premiere in the form of Ezri Dax. When selecting the characters for Deep Space Nine, the production staff knew that they'd have humans, Bajorans, and a changeling; for other characters they wanted to pick \"a species that had already been established\" on TNG. They decided on a Trill, as seen in the form of Odan in the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"The Host\". Although Michael Westmore's alterations to make the Odan headpiece more feminine was as good as all of his work, the writers simply did not like it. Apparently, after she had put on the Odan forehead appliance, someone looked at Terry Farrell and said to Westmore, \"What did you do to her head, she used to be beautiful?\" Instead of changing species, as they'd already come to like the idea of an \"old man\", a person with centuries of experience to guide Sisko, Westmore suggested to \"just give her spots like we gave Famke\", who played a Kriosian in TNG: \"The Perfect Mate\". This make-up was used on all Trill afterwards. When the show began, the writers had difficulty defining the character of Dax. Michael Piller explained, \"Having a Trill seemed like a really, really good idea at the time, but it was the most difficult character for us to define. Jadzia Dax escaped us. At first we thought she was going to be ethereal, a Grace Kelly/Audrey Hepburn kind of goddess, and ultimately I think Ira Behr really figured it out, probably not until the second season, when he really made her a smart-talking, wise-cracking tough cookie.\" (New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features) In 2014, Farrell admitted she found the character initially frustrating. \"The writers didn’t know what to do with the character they created,\" saying she was asked to portray the character as a cross between Grace Kelly and Yoda. She was also annoyed by a scene written where Dax gossiped about who was dating whom on the station, questioning \"Why would a 350 year old person care about who you're going out with?\" Pillar explained, \"The more we've written her, the more we're finding that she is not what she appears to be. That underneath this placid exterior, there's all these various personalities that she's gone through that are in turmoil and there's a lot of inner conflict. You know all the voices we hear inside ourselves are all made up of different subpersonalities; well she's got them all screaming at her in a variety of different ways.\" Ira Behr spoke further on the character, announcing that they had intentionally changed the character by . He said, \"We changed Dax in year two. Originally, she was going to be the Spock character, the wise old owl, the wise old man. And then we realized that she could be the one who's ready to go out and kick anyone's butt, and go out and have an adventure and have fun, and be kind of witty and mercurial. And that turned out to be great. When we found that part of the character, we just ran with it.\" (Crew Dossier: Jadzia Dax, DS9 Season 2 DVD, Special Features) Speaking in 2002, Terry Farrell said of playing Dax, \"It was a character who had lived seven lifetimes, been a man and a woman. Before I walked in and actually met everybody, I felt a little bit intimidated about this, I thought 'Oh my God, I need to meet them so they're going to tell me what I need to know.' And when I actually got here and spoke to everyone, they kind of didn't really know. And I was twenty-eight, and they kind of wanted me to be wiser than my years, just have the physicality of a twenty-eight year old, but have a three hundred and fifty year old wise person inside me. They tried to find what they wanted in adjusting me here and there, and I think really what happened was surrender to that it was all new for this Dax, Jadzia Dax, this experience of the seven lifetimes, and Michael Piller made the decision that she was trying to come to terms with all of these entities, all of these memories that were inside of herself. And I think that helped me a lot as an actress to try to assimilate the job, period, and in a lot of ways, made me feel a little lost and uncomfortable as Terry, which got played out as Jadzia, so it was okay that she slowly felt more comfortable, so did I, and by the time they decided to make me a little bit more roguish in the second or third season, I felt much more comfortable about the dialogue and the other actors, and my lack of stage experience. And when I had to start doing action sequences, and work with Michael Dorn, I felt a lot more comfortable. I had my own voice.\" When asked how she would like Jadzia Dax to be remembered, Terry Farrell said, \"wisely mischievous.\" (Crew Dossier: Jadzia Dax, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features) Following the confirmation of Farrell's departure and plans to kill the character off, Michael Piller wanted to add a couple of lines to \"Star Trek: Insurrection\" (which was still in development) acknowledging Jadzia's death and the impact it had on Worf. Rick Berman eventually overruled this, arguing that this would confuse film audience members who didn't follow the show regularly. Early in the run of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", Michael McGreevey pitched a story to the writers that featured Jadzia and Bashir falling in love. McGreevey commented \"It was a love story, a simple concept. I don't know why they didn't want to do it. The symbiont inside Dax becomes ill, making her ill, and Dr. Bashir must separate them in order to treat the symbiont. We would come to see the personality of Jadzia, which of course is different from Dax. Bashir falls in love with her, and she feels for him, too. But the most important thing in life is to be joined with the symbiont. Bashir realizes that the only way to save the symbiont is to put it back into Jadzia, and thereby lose the girl he loves\". Jadzia Dax is a joined Trill. \"Jadzia\" is the name of the young Trill woman, while \"Dax\" refers to a slug-like symbiont that resides in her abdomen; Jadzia's actual family name was never revealed on the show. In the novels, her original name is said to be Jadzia Idaris. While Jadzia is 28 years old at the beginning of the series, the creature Dax is roughly 300 years old, having previously been hosted by seven other Trill. As a result, Dax may be considered the oldest crewmate on Deep Space Nine. Prior to Jadzia, the Dax symbiont had been hosted by Lela, Tobin, Emony, Audrid, Torias, Joran, and Curzon. The burden of seven lifetimes' worth of memories is not always a positive one; several episodes of \"Deep Space Nine\" focus on Dax's struggle with her dual nature: At the beginning of the series, Jadzia has just recently been joined with the symbiont Dax after the natural death of the previous host, Curzon Dax. Curzon had been a friend and mentor to station Commander Benjamin Sisko, and as Jadzia Dax, they continue this friendship despite the change in circumstances. Throughout the series, Sisko refers to Jadzia Dax by the affectionate nickname \"Old Man.\" She begins the series at the rank of Lieutenant; at the start of the fourth season, she becomes a Lieutenant Commander and remains one until her death in the sixth-season finale. During the first few seasons, Jadzia Dax is pursued romantically by Dr. Julian Bashir. Dax consistently but politely rebuffs him, though she later admits that she somewhat enjoyed the attention (cf. \"Starship Down\"). After Jadzia's death, Dax's new host Ezri begins dating Bashir. During the first season of the show, Jadzia Dax is often portrayed as somewhat reserved and aloof. In the early second-season episode \"\", she is ill-at-ease in the spider-filled caverns of a Bajoran moon, and is later disoriented by Kira's reckless piloting of a Bajoran starfighter. The writers' portrayal of the character begins to change in the second season, as they emphasize Jadzia Dax's gusto for life and extensive knowledge of other cultures: Jadzia Dax's connection to the Klingon culture would become increasingly important as the series progressed, especially after the fourth-season arrival of Worf. In the episode \"The Sword of Kahless\", Dax joins Worf and Kor in the search for the titular Klingon artifact. In \"Sons of Mogh\", she becomes aware of and subsequently warns Captain Sisko of Worf's attempt to kill his brother Kurn, and in \"Soldiers of the Empire\" she and Worf go on a tense mission aboard a Klingon ship. Jadzia Dax would eventually marry Worf and join him as a member of the Klingon House of Martok. Terry Farrell was happy with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the symbiont had been in both male and female hosts, adding that \"Gender wasn't the issue. For the worm/symbiont, it was a matter of the being it was embodied in.\" She was pleased to be able to \"stand up\" for the LGBT community. A similar story had been approached during the first appearance of the Trill in \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\". In this story, however, when the symbiont is transferred from a male to a female host, the Trill is rejected by the character who was the Trill's female partner, Beverly Crusher. The subplot featuring Kahn's artificial wormhole was described as a \"macguffin\" by Moore, and simply a way to get the character into \"Rejoined\". This was not the first subplot to be considered for the episode, with the main plot from \"\" originally thought of as being suitable to appear in either \"Rejoined\" or \"\". Instead, the plot, which involved Rom forming a trade union, was expanded into the main plot of its own episode. The episode was directed by main cast member Avery Brooks, who played Benjamin Sisko in the series, who later said that \"Rejoined\" was his favourite of the episodes he directed. He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, and that it was an extraordinary story about losing someone you love and having that person restored to you some time afterward. Following the death of Jadzia in the finale, \"Tears of the Prophets\", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as \"Rejoined\" between the new Dax host and Worf, as the two were in a relationship at that point. Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called Ezri, as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character. The prejudice against re-association first highlighted in \"Rejoined\" was mentioned in the episodes such as \"\". Writers on \"Deep Space Nine\" had previously hinted at a potential same-sex relationship in the episode \"\", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax' previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in a situation in which it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would be a time when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in \"Rejoined\". Allen Kwan has argued that \"Deep Space Nine\" is the only series of \"Star Trek\" that resists the heteronormativity typical of the franchise, citing both \"Rejoined\" and the Mirror Universe episodes as examples, even if the presented bisexuality is problematized. During that 1995/96 television season there had been an increase in the number of homosexual characters appearing in major television series, and so the same-sex kiss in \"Rejoined\" was reviewed in this context. An article published by the Associated Press suggested that the kiss in \"Deep Space Nine\" was not truly a same-sex kiss due to \"extenuating circumstances\"; namely, one of the characters was an \"alien who used to be a man\". A similar opinion was offered by Jan Johnson-Smith, author of \"American Science Fiction TV\", who said that the situation was \"ambiguous\" as, despite presenting a same-sex kiss, the episode was clear that Jadzia was \"actually kissing the symbiont who has the memories of the former host, her male lover [sic], not the current female host\". (In actuality, Dax was the male-bodied husband while married to Kahn, who was then in a female host.) For film studies scholar Jean Bruce, the ambiguity of the kiss is foreshadowed in an early scene revolving around a magic trick. On the one hand, the magic trick produces a \"pleasurable surprise\", while, on the other, this mirrors the deception necessary, due to Trill norms, in the reacquaintance of the characters. At the same time, the juxtaposition of very different shots serves to \"convey physical distance and the desire to bridge it\", which mirrors the fact that the Trills' love for one another transcends gender, identity and death. Though the kiss is \"informed by the fact that Dax was a man in her past life\", once it occurs, it can \"never be taken back\", and remains the queer image of two women kissing. Nonetheless, \"Rejoined\" was still considered controversial because of its subject matter, which depicts two women who engage in a same-sex romantic relationship, and included one of the first televised lesbian kisses. During the course of the episode, no characters register concern about Dax being involved with a woman, only that she was an ex-spouse. David Greven, literary critic and author of \"Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek\", said that \"Rejoined\" was one of the better-received episodes of \"Star Trek\" that dealt with homosexuality as a theme, but that the franchise overall had typically avoided LGBT issues. Bryan Fuller, who also wrote for \"Deep Space Nine\", said that the franchise had usually avoided those story lines because of the paranoia of the studio regarding homosexuality. Dale Palmer, in an essay on gender and sexual politics, suggested that the choice was made to have a female same-sex kiss on screen because a male one would have alienated the main viewer demographic for the series. Jadzia Dax was initially pursued by Dr. Julian Bashir aboard the station. The Ferengi bar owner, Quark, also has a special affection for the Trill scientist, even after the Dax symbiont was transferred to Ezri. However, her most notable and serious suitors include: In the fourth season, Michael Dorn joins the cast of \"Deep Space Nine\" as the Klingon character Worf. Perhaps because of her past interactions with Klingons, Dax is fairly flirtatious with Worf. Worf appears at first to be oblivious to this attention, and in the fifth-season episode \"Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places\" he becomes enamored with a female Klingon named Grilka. This is resolved by the end of the episode, with Quark ironically winning the heart of Grilka, and Worf becoming romantically involved with Dax. In the beginning, their relationship is very sexual, with the strong implication that their encounters are somewhat rough (the above episode ends with Worf and Dax visiting the infirmary with various bruises and other injuries). In the season 5 finale \"\", the station is overrun by Dominion forces, and Dax and Worf are assigned to different starships for the Dominion War. Near the end of the episode, they agree to get married after the war is over. Worf and Dax's marriage is the centerpiece of season 6 episode \"You Are Cordially Invited...\". During the episode, Dax must obtain permission from the lady Sirella to join the House of Martok. At first Dax is loath to pay Sirella the required respect, and the lady is unwilling to accede to Dax' request. The situation is resolved by the conclusion, with Sirella admitting during the ceremony that nothing can stand between \"the beating of two Klingon hearts\". Jadzia is murdered in \"\", the finale of the sixth season. She and Worf had been trying to conceive, despite the doubts of Dr. Bashir that such a pregnancy was possible. After Major Kira tells Jadzia she has been praying for a conception, Jadzia receives encouraging test results from Julian, and goes to the station's temple to thank the Prophets. It now appears a pregnancy will be possible. The Cardassian Dukat arrives, possessed by a Pah-wraith, with the intention of destroying the orb-like Bajoran artifacts known as the \"Tears of the Prophets\". Jadzia is no match for Dukat while he is infused with the Pah-wraith. He mortally wounds her and destroys the orbs. Upon her death in the infirmary, a distraught Worf screams out a Klingon wail of sorrow for his beloved and to let the Klingon afterworld know a warrior was on the way (\"Heart of Glory\"). Her death shakes the crew to its core: by the beginning of season 7, Sisko has left the station in despair and Worf has been risking his life on increasingly dangerous missions. Though the host Jadzia is dead, the symbiont Dax survives and is implanted in a Trill named Ezri Tigan. The resulting joined Trill, Ezri Dax, becomes a main character during the seventh and last season of the series."], "neg": ["Dahsyat\nDahsyat Dahsyat (or Strikes, also stylized as dahSyat) is an Indonesian television show broadcast daily on Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia (RCTI).

As evidence of its popularity, Indonesian TV audiences voted \"Dahsyat\" their Favorite Music & Variety Show in the Panasonic Awards for five consecutive years from 2010 to 2014 and 2016. In 2016, \"Dahsyat\" subsequently had winning for Most Popular Morning Program at the Indonesian Television Awards. The Dahsyat presenters have not been immune to controversy during the show's lengthy run. In June 2010, Luna Maya left the show after video clips surfaced allegedly showing her taking part in sex acts with Ariel from the band, Peterpan (now known as Noah) and with Cut Tari. Raffi Ahmad's house was raided by police looking for drugs, including marijuana and methylone in 2013. Indonesia's agency responsible for monitoring narcotics charged Ahmad with possession and distribution of category one narcotics; Ahmad spent three months in an outpatient drug rehabilitation clinic. The Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) repeatedly reprimanded Olga Syahputra for coarse humor, including references to male genitalia and jokes about transvestites, rape and, overweight people.

Indonesia\" 's by offering prizes and instituted the new Gaspol format focused on dance events, similar to Trans TV's \"Yuk Keep Smile\" 's Caesar Dance. However, the show's programming has been widely criticized by viewers for a decline in music, increased attention on the presenters' personal lives, long advertisements, and frequent presenter changes.

{"query": "Shogun Warriors toy origins instead of influence on Force Five series", "pos": ["Shogun Warriors (toys)\nShogun Warriors (toys) The Shogun Warriors were the main characters of a line of toys licensed by Mattel Inc. during the late 1970s. They were a series of imported Japanese toys based on several anime and tokusatsu shows featuring giant robots. They were originally manufactured in three sizes: plastic versions, die-cast metal versions, and slightly taller but much more detailed 5-inch (127 mm) die-cast versions. Several vehicles were also offered, as well as a set that could be put together to form the super robot Combattra. Toward the end of production, Mattel proposed the inclusion of plastic toy vehicles for the 3.5\" figures to ride in exclusively in the United States, but these toys were not released for purchase. The toys featured spring-loaded launcher weapons such as missiles, shuriken and battle axes. Some were able to launch their fists, while the later die-cast versions also had the ability to transform into different shapes. Raydeen, for example, could become a birdlike spaceship. These \"convertible\" versions were the precursors to the \"Transformers\" line of toy robots, but unlike the Transformers, minor disassembling was usually required to transform the robots. There was even a robot named Megatron in issue #18 of the \"Shogun Warriors\" comic book series, a name subsequently used multiple times for the leader of the evil Decepticons from the \"Transformers\" series. Sometimes the toys were unable to transform into their second form, one example being Gaiking's \"giant skull\", which was the head for Daiku Maryu, a space dragon toy that was not released in the United States.  Several of the anime-based toys from this toy line reappeared in the 1980s in Jim Terry's \"Force Five\" series. A single movie version was edited from each series and sold on home video. These features aired on the Showtime cable network in 1981 under the name \"Shogun Warriors\". The \"Shogun Warriors\" name was revived by Toynami in 2010 as an all-new toy line. Giant robot characters that featured in the original toy line were:  In addition, two giant movie monsters from Toho were added to the line: Some Super Sentai toys were also adapted for the line. Similarly to other toy lines during the 1970s, the \"Shogun Warriors\" toys came under pressure over safety concerns regarding their spring-loaded weapons. The concern was that children might launch the weapons and hit other children or pets in the eyes. There was also a risk that small children might choke on the small plastic missiles and other parts. Toy manufacturers then faced new regulations as a result of reported injuries received while playing with these toys. Consequently, many toy companies were forced to remodel existing toy lines with child-safe variations such as spring-loaded \"action\" missiles that would remain attached to the toy. Because of this, as well as declining sales, the \"Shogun Warrior\" toy line was discontinued by 1980. The \"Shogun Warriors\" characters were licensed by Marvel Comics to create a comic book series written by Doug Moench and drawn by Herb Trimpe. The series was composed of 20 issues that were published from February 1979 to September 1980. In the comic book series, the Shogun Warriors were created by a mysterious group called the Followers of the Light and human operators were chosen from all around the world to operate the massive robots in order to battle evil. Marvel only licensed three Shogun Warriors characters for the comic book series:  Issue #15 (April 1980) was a fill-in written by Steven Grant with art by Mike Vosburg. The series took a dramatic turn with issue #16 (May 1980), as the Shogun Warriors' mentors were destroyed by the Primal One and his followers. This alien force decided that Earth's technology had outpaced its morality, making it their duty to destroy the Shogun Warriors as well as other powerful humans, including Reed Richards and Tony Stark. Declining sales, as well as Moench's commitment to writing the \"Moon Knight\" comic book series that had just been started, led Marvel to cancel the \"Shogun Warriors\" comic book series. After Marvel lost the rights to the characters, they had a giant robot named the Samurai Destroyer (built from the pieces of an abandoned fourth robot that was never finished) destroy the other three giant robots off-panel, before encountering the Fantastic Four and the robots' pilots Richard, Genji and Ilongo. Between February 1979 and July 1979, Marvel had the comic book rights to both Godzilla and the Shogun Warriors. While the characters never crossed paths in their respective comics, artist Herb Trimpe (who did the artwork for both of the series) drew a variation of Godzilla and Rodan alongside Daimos, Great Mazinger, Raydeen and Gaiking on the top page of a comic book advertisement soliciting the Shogun Warrior toys. Mattel, which had a license to produce Shogun Warriors toys at the time, simultaneously had a licence to produce toys based on Godzilla and Rodan. Though he never appeared in the comic series, Red Ronin, a robot created for Marvel's \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" comic book series, was mentioned occasionally and was frequently written about in the letters pages. In 2010, Toynami revived the \"Shogun Warriors\" name with a new toy line, consisting of Jumbo Machinder toys. The first two robots in this line were GoLion and Dairugger XV, both of which were adapted in the Western world as \"Voltron\".", "Shogun Warriors (video game)\nShogun Warriors (video game) Shogun Warriors, known in Japan as , is a 1992 fighting arcade game developed by Atop and Kaneko and published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and published in North America and Europe by Kaneko. It was the first modern-fighting game based on ancient Japanese mythology, and was created during the fighting game trend of the 1990s that began with Capcom's \"Street Fighter II\". \"Shogun Warriors\" was followed by a sequel titled \"Blood Warrior\". \"Shogun Warriors\" plays similarly to some other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway's \"Mortal Kombat\". The main unique feature of \"Shogun Warriors\" is its \"grabbing system\". When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape. There are eight playable characters, and four bosses. Each with their own fighting style and special techniques based on the ones in Japanese culture. Besides the well-known \"Winners Don't Use Drugs\" screen being added to the North American version, another regional difference is that the Japanese version \"Fujiyama Buster\" contains original voice samples, while the North American and Worldwide versions were dubbed in English for some characters."], "neg": ["Shogun (1986 board game)\nShogun (1986 board game) Shogun, designed by Michael Gray, was a board wargame first released in 1986 by game maker Milton Bradley as part of their Gamemaster series. It was renamed to Samurai Swords in its first re-release (1995) to disambiguate it from other games with the same name (in particular, \"James Clavell's Shogun\", a wargame with a similar theme, released in 1983), and renamed again to Ikusa in its 2011 re-release under Hasbro's Avalon Hill banner. Set in feudal Japan, two to five players take control of a fictional warlord and pit their armies against one another in hopes of winning the title Shogun. In 1988, \"Shogun\" won the Origins Awards for \"Best Pre-20th Century Boardgame of 1987\" and \"Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame of 1987 \". Each player controls a number of daimyō, or generals, who command an army. Other forces on the board represent militia and garrisons. Players also have the option of hiring ronin (mercenaries). There is also a ninja, principally used as an assassin against enemy daimyō. Units include samurai swordsmen and bowmen, and ashigaru spearmen and gunners. Income, called koku, is derived from control of territories. Players attempt to destroy their rivals in battle and seize their territories. Some interesting features include the orchestration of armies in battle, the emphasis on generals (who gain levels, much like roleplaying game characters), and the unpredictable element of ronin placement. The game uses six twelve-sided dice. The trays for units are designed to resemble Japanese fortresses, and each player receives a small katana (to display the order in which players take their turns). David M. Ewalt of Forbes commented on the 2011 release of Ikusa: \"The game formerly known as Samurai Swords (and before that as Shogun) gets another makeover. Still the same strategy classic where players compete to rule feudal Japan, but the box, board and pieces have been updated. Not cheap, but the redesign looks great and the game’s as fun as ever.\""]}
{"query": "Valle municipality history and culture instead of geographical location near Rosskreppfjorden", "pos": ["Valle, Norway\nValle, Norway is a municipality in Aust-Agder county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Setesdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Valle. Other villages in Valle include Besteland, Brokke, Homme, Hovet, Rygnestad, Rysstad, and Uppstad. The municipality is the 75th largest by area out of the 422 municipalities in Norway. Valle is the 374th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 1,246. The municipality's population density is and its population has decreased by 5.6% over the last decade. Valle was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1902, the northern part of Valle (population: 476) was separated to become the separate municipality of Bykle. This left Valle with 1,720 inhabitants. On 1 July 1915, the southern district of Valle (population: 658) was separated to form the new municipality of Hylestad. This left Valle with a population of 1,051. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the municipalities of Hylestad (population: 662) and Valle (population: 902) were merged into one municipality named Valle. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old \"Valle\" farm (Old Norse: \"Vǫllr\"), since the first Valle Church was built there. The form of the name is the genitive case, from the common expressions \"Vallar kirkja\" (church) and \"Vallar sókn\" (parish). The coat-of-arms is from modern times; they were granted on 11 May 1984. The arms are red and they show five Saint Andrew's crosses in the pattern 2-1-2, together forming a larger cross. The composition was based on the decoration in the medieval Hylestad stave church, located in Rysstad. This pattern is also used in traditional clothes made in the municipality. The Church of Norway has one parish \"(sokn)\" within the municipality of Valle. It is part of the Otredal prosti (\"deanery\") in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The municipality of Valle is bordered to the north by the municipalities of Bykle (in Aust-Agder county) and Tokke (in Telemark county). To the east, it is bordered by Fyresdal municipality in Telemark, to the south it is bordered by Bygland municipality in Aust-Agder, and to the west it is bordered by Sirdal municipality in Vest-Agder county. Valle lies in the middle of Setesdal, a valley and a traditional district in Aust-Agder that included the municipalities of Bykle, Valle, Bygland, Iveland, and Evje og Hornnes. The Otra river flows from the Hardangervidda plateau in Telemark to the north, through the Setesdal valley (and through Valle), into the sea near the city of Kristiansand. Valle is separated from the neighbouring valleys in the east and west by the large Setesdalsheiene mountain plateaus. Before the valley was linked by road to Kristiansand in the 1840s, people routinely traveled east and west across these moorlands. The highest point is the tall Skammevarden. Other high mountains in Valle include Bergeheii, Skjerkenuten, Svarvarnuten, and Urddalsknuten. The high mountains are the starting points for several large rivers including the Kvina and Tovdalselva. Several large lakes are also located in Valle including Botnsvatnet, Kolsvatnet, Rosskreppfjorden, Store Bjørnevatn, Straumsfjorden, and Øyarvatnet. The Hallandsfossen and the Gloppefossen are two larger waterfalls in Valle. There are two central population centres in the municipality: Valle and Rysstad. The village of Valle is the site of the municipal administration and Rysstad was the site of the municipal administration in the old municipality of Hylestad. The Hylestad stave church, constructed in the 12th century in Setesdal was demolished in the 19th century. Its portal, with several carved scenes illustrating the legend of Sigurd Fåvnesbane (Sigurd the Dragon-slayer), is on display at University Museum of Antiquities in Oslo (\"Universitetets Oldsaksamling, Historisk Museum, Oslo\"). Sigurd's slaying of Fafnir with his sword \"Gram\" is described in the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson and the Volsunga saga as well as alluded to in Beowulf and Njáls saga. Rygnestadtunet is a historical family farm in Rygnestad, built by Vonde-Åsmund (Åsmund the Evil) in the mid-1500s. Today, it is an open-air museum that is part of the Setesdal Museum. The farm was sold to museum by Gyro Rygnestad and her family in the 1920s. Today, it is represented to visitors exactly as it was in 1919. Grave findings around the farm indicate that the site was settled as early as 900 AD. Another farm museum in Valle is Tveitetunet. There are also several old silver smithies and barns that can be seen in Rysstad. Historically, Valle was very isolated from other parts of Setesdal. To get from Valle to the Bykle area to the north, residents had to traverse the Byklestigen pass along the river Otra. The pass was a torturous trail up a steep cliff face. Until the 1870s, it was the only route to travel from Valle in the middle Setesdal valley to Bykle in the north. It runs above the river Otra and was the site of numerous accidents on the hazardous route. Today, the Norwegian National Road 9 passes through the mountain in a tunnel providing a fast, easy route north. Between Valle in Setesdal on the western side of the mountains and Fyresdal on the eastern side, one finds a medieval trail over the high plateau that priests and bishops used in order to get between the counties of Agder and Telemark. This track is named Bispevegen (\"Bishop's Road\") and every year a march called \"Bispevegmarsjen\" (\"The Bishop's Road March\") starts at Kleivgrend in Fyresdal. Traditional music is popular in this region. There is a Jew's harp monument in Valle.

The campus is located south of Chicago, Illinois. GSU was founded in 1969. GSU is a comprehensive public university with a broad curriculum, offering degree programs at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. GSU has four colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Education, and the College of Health and Human Services. Governors State University was officially established as a state-supported institution of higher education on July 17, 1969, when Illinois Governor Richard B. Ogilvie signed into law House Bill 666. The university was to have opened with its first class of students in September 1973. However, the four year planning period was reduced to two years and GSU received its first class of students in September 1971. GSU was one of the original \"Universities without Walls\" as well as a university that did not offer grades, but competencies. In place of departments, it had interdisciplinary studies, and all professors hold the rank of University Professor. GSU has developed into a more traditional university, with divisions and departments, professors with rank (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor), and classrooms with smart technology. The first doctoral program was created in 2007 as a professional doctoral degree in Physical Therapy. GSU has the following colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, Education, and Health and Human Services. The university as a whole is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the public administration program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA). The university is also a member of the Illinois Council of Baccalaureate and Higher Degree Programs. Governors State University was awarded the 2015 American Council on Education/Fidelity Investments Award for Institutional Transformation. It is given to \"colleges or universities which, in a period of great change in higher education, have responded to challenges in innovative and creative ways that allows the institution to thrive.\" In 2014, GSU's Dual Degree Program was honored with the Student Success and College Completion Award by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. In 2014, the National Resource Center for the First Year Experience and Students in Transition also recognized the Dual Degree Program at GSU with an award during its annual conference. The NRC launched the new award for \"...institutions that have designed and implemented outstanding collaborative initiatives enhancing significant transitions during the undergraduate experience. Award recipients ... have demonstrated the effectiveness of the initiative in supporting student success, learning and development at a variety of transition points beyond the first college year and in responding to unique institutional needs.\" The university also received the 2010 Governor's Sustainability Award for significant achievements in protecting the environment, helping sustain the future, and improving the economy. The awards were presented by the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC) during a luncheon in Champaign. Located south of Chicago, GSU is situated at the intersection of city neighborhoods, suburban villages, and rural towns. It is also less than 30 minutes' drive from cities like Kankakee and Joliet as well as northwestern Indiana. The main campus is located on a wooded landscape with several lakes and natural trails.  In 2008, GSU renovated several parking lots, replacing asphalt with permeable pavers—interlocking bricks that allow rainwater to seep down, trapping heavy metals and pollutants before they enter storm sewers. GSU is also home to one of the state’s largest solar-thermal systems, which preheats water for the campus swimming pool and provides about one-third of the domestic hot water for the university’s main building. In October 21, 2010, Warren Ribley, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, announced a $153,000 grant for the 50-kilowatt wind turbine to be located on the University Park campus. With the installation of an on-campus wind turbine, Governors State University will continue reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, and move toward its goal of becoming Illinois’ \"greenest\" university. The wind turbine will give Governors State a clean, renewable source of energy, and also be incorporated into the university’s academic programs. On October 18, 2011, GSU held a groundbreaking ceremony for the beginning of the renovation of the university’s science facilities. The $22.6 million, three year renovation project will create state-of-the-art education facilities while providing more than 130 construction jobs. In addition to the positive impact the renovation project will have on the region’s economy, the building renovation will better equip GSU to educate students for regional jobs in healthcare, computer science, scientific, and mathematics research, and science and math education. The area to be renovated comprises approximately of space. During the renovation, crews will replace HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and lighting systems. Outmoded infrastructure and equipment will be replaced with modern facilities and equipment that will be energy-efficient and meet current codes and regulations. The project design calls for structural infill of existing atrium space, adding about of additional usable space. The renovated facilities will serve students and faculty in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, nursing, communication disorders, occupational therapy, and physical therapy.

{"query": "The Strongest team history and achievements beyond Renán Addles' contributions.", "pos": ["The Strongest\nThe Strongest Club The Strongest is a Bolivian football club based in La Paz founded on 8 April 1908. Their team colours are yellow and black. Although they have a home ground, the Rafael Mendoza Castellón (capacity: 15,000), they play most of their games at the Estadio Hernando Siles, Bolivia's national ground (capacity: 42,000). The club is the oldest active football club in Bolivia and the only team to have played continuously in the country's top division for longer than a century. The club was well represented in the Bolivian squad at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the last such tournament in which the national team participated, by Marcelo Torrico, Gustavo Quinteros, Óscar Sánchez and José Melgar. In the 2016-17 Apertura season, The Strongest drew an average home attendance of 10,924, the second-highest in the league. The Strongest were originally known as \"The Strong Football Club\", before later becoming \"The Strongest Football Club\". Its first President and founder was José León López Villamil. Its first championship was in 1911, well before any of the current Bolivian teams had even been created. In 1930, The Strongest became the first and only Bolivian team to win a League championship with no goals scored against them. The same year, The Strongest inaugurated the Estadio Hernando Siles, with a 4–1 victory against its classical rival (at the time), Universitario. It is the only football team in the world to have a battle named after it. In the Chaco War (1932–1935) the players, staff and members of the club enlisted in the Bolivian Army. A division largely composed of these \"Stronguistas\" played a vital part in the Bolivian Army's most important victory. As a result of that, the battle is named \"Batalla de Cañada Strongest\" in Bolivian history books. In 1965, The Strongest participated in its first Copa Libertadores, at a time when only national champions were entered into the tournament. The Strongest scored Bolivia's first victory outside of the country on a club level, defeating Deportivo Quito. The team finished 2nd in its group that year, second to Boca Juniors (Argentina). The highest achievement in an international competition for The Strongest was achieved in the 2005 Copa Sudamericana, when the squad led by coach Villegas eliminated its classic rivals with two 2–1 victories in La Paz, in front of a packed stadium. Later, the team went on to defeat LDU Quito (Ecuador) – including a 3–0 victory in Quito. The Strongest was eliminated by Pumas UNAM (Mexico), who later went on to become runners-up to cup winners Boca Juniors (Argentina). The greatest president in The Strongest's history, he was in charge of the club from 1966 to 1978. In that time, he dealt with the Viloco Tragedy and with many economic hardships, consequent of the political instability of Bolivia and the global economic depression. One of the greatest achievements was to consolidate the Achumani Sports Complex where the Estadio Rafael Mendoza currently sits. There were many hardships to reach this goal. First, the club had to secure the lands, which were much more extensive than the small lot the club had in Achumani, near the more centrally located Achumani Market. \"Don Rafo\", in a meeting with other directors, said that now was the time to stop thinking small and start thinking in the future of the team. The stadium was built and rebuilt (after the river kept eating away at the foundations for some time) from 1974 to 1986. Along with this, the complex was finished including tennis, racquetball, volleyball, and basketball courts. It also has a swimming pool and dining facilities. It is the location for most meetings and soccer events. \"Don Rafo\" is best remembered for his hard work in the Achumani Sports Complex. However, he was also one of the few club presidents to put money into the club. Also, in this time, The Strongest achieved great national and international success. Some events to remember in his presidency are the visit by Pelé's Santos team in 1971, an amazing game against Boca Juniors led by Antonio Roma and Silvio Marzolini, and many national championships including the formation of the Liga de Futbol Profesional Boliviano. On 24 September 1969, a local holiday, the team was invited to participate in an exhibition game in Santa Cruz organized by the Asociacion Cruceña de Fubol (Santa Cruz's football association); the team had played its last official match on 14 September, and the friendly game was part of a break from their local competition. On 26 September, the day the team was due to return from Santa Cruz by plane, it was announced that the aircraft carrying twenty members of the team had disappeared. A day later, there was news that the plane had crashed near Viloco, a rural area between the Tres Cruces Peaks. All sixty-nine passengers and five crew members died; the cause of the crash was attributed to pilot error. Members of the team who died in the crash were:   The Strongest adopted the yellow and black stripes upon foundation in 1908. While looking for a proper uniform, a friend sent the founders a shirt from Germany that sported a dark green with horizontal, yellow stripes. Upon this, one of the founders commented on how a local bird, the Chayñita, had similar colours. The club adopted the idea and since 1908, the main outfit has been vertically striped yellow and black with a varying number of stripes. The supplementary uniform has commonly been white with yellow and black, though there have been several other combinations such as a full yellow top and black shorts and even full yellow outfit. More recently, an all black secondary uniform has been adopted for Cup matches. It is sometimes claimed that the similarity to the kit of Peñarol of Montevideo, Uruguay is due to the fact that The Strongest lacked originality and imitated those colours. However, this theory is countered by the argument that Peñarol did not adopt a full striped kit until the 1905 season, and was an unknown team at the time (won 4 titles in its 24-year existence, up to that point).       \"See also .\""], "neg": ["Baseball Dynasties\nBaseball Dynasties Baseball Dynasties: The Greatest Teams of All Time is a non-fiction baseball book, co-written by Rob Neyer and Eddie Epstein.

The lake measured about and contained about of water, half the volume of Lake Michigan. The \"Glacial Lake Missoula National Natural Landmark\" is located about 110 kilometres (68 mi) northwest of Missoula, Montana, at the north end of the Camas Prairie Valley, just east of Montana Highway 382 and Macfarlane Ranch. It was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1966 because it contains the great ripples (often measuring high and long) that served as a strong supporting element for J Harlen Bretz's contention that Washington State's Channeled Scablands were formed by repeated cataclysmic floods over only about 2,000 years, rather than through the millions of years of erosion that had been previously assumed. The lake was the result of an ice dam on the Clark Fork caused by the southern encroachment of a finger of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet into the Idaho Panhandle (at the present day location of Clark Fork, Idaho, at the east end of Lake Pend Oreille). The height of the ice dam typically approached , flooding the valleys of western Montana approximately eastward. It was the largest ice-dammed lake known to have occurred. The periodic rupturing of the ice dam resulted in the Missoula Floods – cataclysmic floods that swept across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Gorge approximately 40 times during a 2,000 year period. The cumulative effect of the floods was to excavate of loess, sediment and basalt from the channeled scablands of eastern Washington and to transport it downstream. These floods are noteworthy for producing canyons and other large geologic features through cataclysms rather than through more typical gradual processes. In addition, Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits have been documented to comprise parts of the glaciofluvial deposits, informally known as the \"Hanford formation\" that are found in parts of the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Channeled Scabland, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. The age of these deposits is demonstrated by the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded in these glaciofluvial deposits, sequences of sediments with normal and reverse magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes. Based upon these criteria, Quaternary geologists estimated that the oldest of the Pleistocene Missoula floods happened before 1.5 million years ago. The older Pleistocene glaciofluvial deposits within the Hanford formation are fragmentary in nature because they have been repeatedly eroded and largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods. Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as \"Ancient Cataclysmic Floods\", that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence. Although Lake Missoula likely was the source of many of the Ancient Cataclysmic Floods, the fragmentary nature of the older deposits within the Hanford formation makes precise determination of the precise origin of the floods that deposited them very difficult."], "neg": ["January 2018 Western United States floods\nJanuary 2018 Western United States floods The January 2018 American West floods occurred due to heavy precipitation in the Western United States.

It seeks to question some of the issues and challenges raised by England's common purpose legal doctrine. The drama focuses on England's controversial joint enterprise doctrine. It is set in North West England, and was filmed in Liverpool (although the city is never mentioned). First shown on 6 July 2014, the drama examines the issues surrounding a case in which the defendants were charged with murder involving joint enterprise or common purpose. McGovern was inspired by the real life case of 16-year-old Jordan Cunliffe, sentenced under this law for a minimum term of 12 years for the murder of Garry Newlove, despite Cunliffe not actively taking part in the attack. Johnjo O'Shea is an ordinary 17-year-old except that he is a haemophiliac. He is asked to give a few friends of his older brother a lift in his brother's car so that they can visit a pizza takeaway.  Johnjo is unaware that one of his passengers has been tipped off by a friend who runs that shift at the pizza place that an adversary is about to enter and that the real reason for wanting a lift is to get there quickly to confront him. One of the other boys starts an argument with a bystander (Tommy Ward) and stabs him fatally. The drama then follows the police and legal procedures as well as the conflicts between family members, the boys involved and the community. Although he and his family consider him to be an innocent bystander, he ends up in court charged as an accessory to murder, under the doctrine of common purpose (the \"common\" of the film's title), which may also make reference to the view that segments of society might take of the working-class youths involved. The end shows Johnjo's mother and Margaret Ward, the mother of the murdered boy, talking in the street. The latter shows the former a letter that she received from Johnjo that apologises for what happened and accepts a degree of culpability because even though he had not taken part, the fact that he was born allowed it to happen. Both mothers see the truth in Johnjo's innocence, the flawed decency in his view on culpability and the tragedy that both will be deprived of innocent sons although only one permanently. They embrace before Margaret Ward turns and walks away. \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave it 4/5 stars, calling it \"profoundly engaging\", with Nico Mirallegro, \"giving a fine performance of coiled vulnerability\". According to The Guardian, \"When Jimmy McGovern gets off his soapbox this is a brutal and devastating drama\", \"bleak, powerful drama thick with political intent, which occasionally robs it of its quality\", and \"the knockout performance belongs to Susan Lynch, who plays the victim's mother\". \"The Daily Mirror\" noted that \"\"Common\" was unrelentingly depressing. It's about real tragedy, where no character you invest in wins\". And \"McGovern's a genius wordsmith, an engaging social commentator who deftly avoids being throat-ramming with his message, but he also understands people – as sure as he can paint the most evil potential of mankind, he equally draws out the good.\" \"The Daily Mail\" was more critical in its review, \"the BBC spent licence fee money on commissioning a 90-minute drama railing against what lawyers describe as a 'powerful' and useful piece of legislation designed to stop criminals getting away with it by blaming each other.\" They also noted that the law had been used to good effect in the murder of Stephen Lawrence case as well as that of Malakai McKenzie."]}
{"query": "Zentralarbeitsgemeinschaft impact on post-Weimar Germany instead of its creation in 1918", "pos": ["Feminism in Germany\nFeminism in Germany Feminism in Germany as a modern movement began during the Wilhelmine period (1888–1918) with individual women and women's rights groups pressuring a range of traditional institutions, from universities to government, to open their doors to women. This movement culminated in women's suffrage in 1919. Later waves of feminist activists pushed to expand women's rights. Feminism in Germany has its earliest roots in the lives of women who challenged conventional gender roles as early as the Medieval period. From the early Medieval period and continuing through to the 18th century, Germanic law assigned women to a subordinate and dependent position relative to men. Salic (Frankish) law, from which the laws of the German lands would be based, placed women at a disadvantage with regard to property and inheritance rights. Germanic widows required a male guardian to represent them in court. Unlike Anglo-Saxon law or the Visigothic Code, Salic law barred women from royal succession. Social status was based on military and biological roles, a reality demonstrated in rituals associated with newborns, when female infants were given a lesser value than male infants. The use of physical force against wives was condoned until the 18th century in Bavarian law. Some women of means asserted their influence during the Middle Ages, typically in royal court or convent settings. Hildegard of Bingen, Gertrude the Great, Elisabeth of Bavaria (1478–1504), and Argula von Grumbach are among the women who pursued independent accomplishments in fields as diverse as medicine, music composition, religious writing, and government and military politics. Legal recognition of women's rights in Germany came more slowly than in some other countries, such as England, France, the United States, or Canada. The equal rights of parents under German law did not arrive until the German Federal Republic in the 20th century; the German Civil Code introduced in 1900 had left the law unaltered in the matter, basing it precisely on the General state laws for the Prussian states of 1794. Property rights were also slow to change. During the late 19th century, married women still had no property rights, requiring a male guardian to administer property on their behalf (exceptions were made for cases involving imprisoned or absent husbands). Any woman who had inherited an artisan business had some freedom in practice to run the business, but she was not permitted to attend guild meetings, and had to send a male to represent her interests. Tradition dictated that \"the state recognizes a burgher but not a burgess\". The Age of Enlightenment brought a consciousness of feminist thinking to England and France, most influentially in the works of Mary Wollstonecraft. This was a development that lagged in German-speaking regions. Where upper class women were literate in England and France and sometimes became prolific writers of feminist works, a network of feminist writers and activists was slow to emerge in what would become modern Germany. Many reasons have been considered as having a bearing upon this dilemma, from fractured regions, to the lack of a capital city, to the slow spread of novels and other literary forms in German-speaking areas. Women with literary talent were more likely to work in relative isolation, yet they left a legacy of letters and memoirs that gained a new popularity as the nostalgic Kulturgeschichte (culture history) trend in the first decades of the 20th century. Feminist ideas still began to spread, and some radical women became outspoken in promoting the cause of women's rights. Sophie Mereau launched the \"Almanach für Frauen\" (Women's Almanac) in 1784. Feminism as a movement began to gain ground toward the end of the 19th century, although it did not yet include a strong push to extend suffrage to German women. Some women who worked for women's rights were in fact opposed to extending the vote to women, a stance that became more widespread at the turn of the 20th century, when many Germans were concerned that granting women the vote would result in more votes for socialists. Germany's unification process after 1871 was heavily dominated by men and gave priority to the \"Fatherland\" theme and related male issues, such as military prowess. Nevertheless, women became much better organized themselves. Middle class women enrolled in the \"Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine\", the Union of German Feminist Organizations (BDF). Founded in 1894, it grew to include 137 separate women's rights groups from 1907 until 1933, when the Nazi regime disbanded the organization. The BDF gave national direction to the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists. Formal organizations for promoting women's rights grew in numbers during the Wilhelmine period. German feminists began to network with feminists from other countries, and participated in the growth of international organizations; Marie Stritt was active as a feminist leader not only in Germany but with the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). Stritt met the radical feminists Anita Augspurg (Germany's first woman university graduate) and Minna Cauer, and became a supporter of the Women's Legal Aid Society. Stritt's goals included suffrage for women, access to higher education, an end to state-regulated prostitution, free access to contraception and abortion, and reforms to divorce laws. Stritt was active as a member and leader in many German feminist organizations during the late 19th century and early 20th century, including:  The FGWA had been moderate in its positions until 1902, then launched a campaign to reform the civil code, but the campaign failed to bring about any changes. Stritt found herself on the radical edge of Germany's feminist movement, spearheading the German Association for Women's Suffrage from 1911 until it disbanded in 1919, having achieved the goal of women's suffrage in November of that year. Socialist feminists were active in promoting the rights of working class women. Socialist, communist, and social democratic organizations had feminist members, who promoted women's rights with mixed success. During the rise of nationalism in this era, one Fascist organization that was vocally anti-feminist was the German National Association of Commercial Employees (\"Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfenverband\", or DHV), which promoted the interests of the merchant class. There was little opportunity for feminists of the working class and feminists of the middle or upper classes to work together. The expansion of Germany's industrial economy during the 1890s and up to World War I had brought more women into the labour force. However, cooperation between the social classes was \"unfeasible\" at the time. Women's emancipation was attained despite pressure from The German League for the Prevention of Women's Emancipation, which numbered several hundred supporters and was active beginning in 1912, disbanding in 1920. The antifeminist sentiment among some Germans reflected a variety of arguments against women's emancipation:  Writer Hedwig Dohm gave some impetus to the feminist movement in Germany with her writings during the late 19th century, with her argument that women's roles were created by society rather than being a biological imperative. During this period, a wider range of feminist writings from other languages were being translated into German, deepening the feminist discourse further for German women. In \"Sex in Education, Or, A Fair Chance for Girls\" (1873), educator Edward H. Clarke researched educational standards in Germany. He found that by the 1870s, formal education for middle and upper class girls was the norm in Germany's cities, although it ended at the onset of menarche, which typically happened when a girl was 15 or 16. After this, her education might continue at home with tutors or occasional lectures. Clarke concluded that \"Evidently the notion that a boy's education and a girl's education should be the same, and that the same means the boy's, has not yet penetrated the German mind. This has not yet evolved the idea of the identical education of the sexes.\" Education for peasant girls was not formal, and they learned farming and housekeeping tasks from their parents. This prepared them for a life of harsh labour on the farm. On a visit to Germany, Clarke observed that:  Young middle class and upper class women began to pressure their families and the universities to allow them access to higher education. Anita Augspurg, the first woman university graduate in Germany, graduated with a law degree from the University of Zurich, Switzerland. Several other German women, unable to gain admittance to German universities, also went to the University of Zurich to continue their education. In 1909, German universities finally allowed women to gain admittance—but women graduates were unable to practice their profession, as they were \"barred from private practice and public administrative posts for lawyers\". The first women's legal aid agency was established by Marie Stritt in 1894; by 1914, there were 97 such legal aid agencies, some employing women law graduates. Following women's enfranchisement, women's rights made significant gains in Germany during the Weimar Republic period. The Weimar Constitution of 1919 enacted equality in education for the sexes, equal opportunity in civil service appointments, and equal pay in the professions. These changes put Germany in the group of advanced countries in terms of women's legal rights (Czechoslovakia, Iceland, Lithuania and the Soviet Union also had no distinction between the sexes in the professions, while countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Norway held onto restrictions to the professions for women throughout the inter-war period). Germany's Reichstag had 32 women deputies in 1926 (6.7% of the Reichstag), giving women representation at the national level that surpassed countries such as Great Britain (2.1% of the House of Commons) and the United States (1.1% of the House of Representatives); this climbed to 35 women deputies in the Reichstag in 1933 on the eve of the Nazi dictatorship, when Great Britain still had only 15 women members in the House of Commons. The umbrella group of feminist organizations, the \"Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine\" (BDF), remained the dominant force in German feminism during the inter-war period. It had around 300,000 members at the start of World War I, growing to over 900,000 members during the 1920s; it has been noted, however, that the middle-class membership was far from radical, and promoted maternal \"clichés\" and \"bourgeois responsibilities\". Other feminist groups were organized around religious faiths, and there were many Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish feminist groups. The Weimar Republic was an era of political fragmentation in Germany. Along with the economic chaos of the inter-war years, Weimar culture in general had a degree of social chaos, which was experienced in the city of Berlin in particular. War widows and their children struggled to earn a living in a city where hunger, unemployment, and crime were rampant. At the same time, a liberation of social mores meant that women had a social freedom they had not experienced until then. Socialists and communists in particular became open in demanding free access to contraception and abortion, asserting, \"Your body belongs to you\". Historians have paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the liberal Weimar Republic. It appears the role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically, the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family. However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control. In 1934, Hitler proclaimed, \"[A woman's] world is her husband, her family, her children, her house.\" Women's highest calling was to be motherhood. Laws that had protected women's rights were repealed and new laws were introduced to restrict women to the home and in their roles as wives and mothers. Women were barred from government and university positions. Women's rights groups, such as the moderate BDF, were disbanded, and replaced with new social groups that would reinforce Nazi values, under the leadership of the Nazi Party and the head of women's affairs in Nazi Germany, \"Reichsfrauenführerin\" Gertrud Scholtz-Klink. In 1944-45, more than 500,000 women volunteers were uniformed auxiliaries in the German armed forces (Wehrmacht). About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses, and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy. In the Luftwaffe, they served in combat roles helping to operate the anti—aircraft systems that shot down Allied bombers. Political life in the Federal Republic of Germany during the post-War period was conservative in character: Demographic changes resulting from World War II meant that women were a larger proportion of the electorate for several decades, but this did not result in significant representation in government; by 1987, women were still only 10% of the representatives in the Bundestag. Women had less education, and were less likely to be employed, either in the professions, or the service industry. Yet, after the Federal Republic of Germany began making strides in its recovery from the aftermath of World War II, feminist issues began rising to the surface of public consciousness. Feminist writers such as Betty Friedan were translated into German, and a new generation of German feminists began agitating for social change. A disillusionment with conventional political parties, and even with standard Marxist activism, led to the growth of the radical Left during the 1970s, including militant groups. \"Rote Zora\" was one anti-patriarchy terrorist group; while it carried out an estimated 45 bombings and arson attacks between 1974 and 1995, it accomplished little. A development in the Left that had a longer-lasting impact was the establishment of the Green Party in 1980. Feminists pushed the Green Party to include abortion reform as an \"unqualified party commitment\", and as more feminists became part of the Party leadership, women's rights were brought to prominence by the mid-1980s. West Germany's most well-known feminist, the \"mediagenic\" Alice Schwarzer, founded the popular feminist magazine EMMA in 1977, and remains its Editor-in-Chief. State socialism in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) ostensibly meant equality between the sexes. Marxist writers such as Frederick Engels, August Bebel, and Clara Zetkin had written of the role of gender exploitation in capitalism. In the GDR, there was little public consciousness of conflict between the sexes, although women's rights were discussed by certain activist groups, drawing Stasi attention. The official GDR line during the 1960s and 1970s was that the Western feminist movement was \"man-hating\". Women in the GDR were reputed to have a more exhausting way of life than women in the FRG, for a number of reasons. In addition to a longer formal workweek for GDR workers, women performed three-quarters of the housework and childcare. Few people owned cars, and product shortages and long lines made errands such as grocery shopping more time-consuming. Although men were entitled to one year of parental leave following the birth of a child, this was not actually taken. By the 1970s, some GDR writers were observing that women's social roles were lagging their legal and economic status. Women began to receive extension to paid maternity leave that were generous by Western standards. By the early 21st century, issues of intersectionality between diverse social groups gained the attention of a larger number of feminists and other social reformers in Germany and beyond. After decades of pushing for greater legal recognition as full citizens, Gastarbeiter (guest workers) and their children (often born and raised in Germany) won some reforms at the national level in the late 1990s. During this time, women's rights groups had not, in general, made the guest worker issue a feminist cause. There were sporadic instances of women's rights groups voicing support for women guest workers' right to vote, and to have other women's rights included in the government's 1998 draft law for guest workers. Networked feminism, where women's rights activists communicate and organize using social media, is a growing trend among younger feminists in Germany. The Ukrainian feminist organization FEMEN, established in 2008, has spread to Germany as of 2013. Chapters have been founded in Berlin and Hamburg. In late 2012 and early 2013, Twitter became the medium of mass protests against common types of sexist harassment. Using the hashtags #\"aufschrei\" (outcry), more than 100,000 tweets (messages) were sent to protest personal experiences of harassment, raising awareness of the issue and generating national and international press coverage. Women's representation in government and the workforce has made progress in the early 21st century. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has established her key role in European politics. Merkel's time in office has not been without controversy related to women's rights legislation; in 2013, she opposed an EU proposal to introduce 40-percent female quota on executive boards in all publicly listed companies with more than 250 employees by 2020, on the basis that this was a violation of member states' affairs. Germany's Labour Minister, Ursula von der Leyen, a supporter of the quota in Germany, received a written order from Merkel to \"alter her ministry's lack of an objection to the EU directive, so that the cabinet could present a unified face to Germany's EU officials\". However, in March 2015 the SPD party won the battle on female quota. A new law requires about 100 companies to appoint women on 30 percent of their supervisory board seats, beginning in 2016. In addition, 3,500 companies are required to submit plans to increase the female share in top positions.", "General Workers' Union of Germany\nGeneral Workers' Union of Germany General Workers' Union of Germany (; AAUD), was the name of factory organisations formed following the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in opposition to the traditional trade unions. The AAUD was formed by the left communists in the Communist Workers' Party of Germany (KAPD) who considered organising based on trades as being an outmoded form of organisation and instead advocated organising workers based on factories, thus forming the AAUD. They were influenced by the industrial unionism of the Industrial Workers of the World. The council communists organised these factory organisations as the basis for region-wide workers' councils.

In developing countries, these services often take the form of microfinance. In developed countries, the services may be similar to those provided by banks and include payday loans, rent-to-own agreements, pawnshops, refund anticipation loans, some subprime mortgage loans and car title loans, and non-bank check cashing, money orders, and money transfers. It also includes traditional moneylending by door-to-door collection. In New York City, these are called check-cashing stores, and they are legally exempted from the 25 percent criminal usury cap. Alternative financial services are typically provided by non-bank financial institutions, although person-to-person lending and crowd funding also play a role. These alternative financial service providers are estimated to process about 280 million transactions per year, representing roughly $78 billion in revenue. Customers include the unbanked. Alternative financial services in the United States, for example via payday loans, are more extensive than in some other countries, because the major banks in the U.S. are less willing to lend to people with marginal credit ratings than their counterparts in many other countries. In the United Kingdom, alternative financial services include payday loans and money lending, the latter termed \"home collected credit\" or \"home credit\". Organizations such as Debt on our Doorstep campaign for improved regulation.", "Affordable housing\nAffordable housing Affordable housing is housing which is deemed affordable to those with a median household income as rated by the national government or a local government by a recognized housing affordability index. Most of the literature on affordable housing refers to mortgages and number of forms that exist along a continuum – from emergency shelters, to transitional housing, to non-market rental (also known as social or subsidized housing), to formal and informal rental, indigenous housing, and ending with affordable home ownership. In Australia, the National Affordable Housing Summit Group developed their definition of affordable housing as housing that is \"...reasonably adequate in standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a sustainable basis.\" In the United Kingdom affordable housing includes \"social rented and intermediate housing, provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market.\" The notion of housing affordability became widespread in the 1980s in Europe and North America. In the words of Alain Bertaud, of New York University and former principal planner at the World Bank,\"It is time for planners to abandon abstract objectives and to focus their efforts on two measurable outcomes that have always mattered since the growth of large cities during the 19th century’s industrial revolution: workers’ spatial mobility and housing affordability.\"Housing choice is a response to an extremely complex set of economic, social, and psychological impulses. For example, some households may choose to spend more on housing because they feel they can afford to, while others may not have a choice. The Median Multiple indicator, recommended by the World Bank and the United Nations, rates affordability of housing by dividing the median house price by gross [before tax] annual median household income). \"A common measure of community-wide affordability is the number of homes that a household with a certain percentage of median income can afford. For example, in a perfectly balanced housing market, the median household (the wealthier half of households) could officially afford the median housing option, while those poorer than the median income could not afford the median home. 50% affordability for the median home indicates a balanced market.\"Determining housing affordability is complex and the commonly used housing-expenditure-to-income-ratio tool has been challenged. In the United States and Canada, a commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is a housing cost that does not exceed 30% of a household's gross income. Canada, for example, switched to a 25% rule from a 20% rule in the 1950s. In the 1980s this was replaced by a 30% rule. India uses a 40% rule. One of the greatest strengths of the HAI developed by MIT is its ability to capture the Total Cost of Ownership of individuals' housing choices. In computing the index the obvious cost of rents and mortgage payments are modified by the hidden costs of those choices. Income is the primary factor—not price and availability, that determines housing affordability. In a market economy the distribution of income is the key determinant of the quantity and quality of housing obtained. Therefore, understanding affordable housing challenges requires understanding trends and disparities in income and wealth. Housing is often the single biggest expenditure of low and middle income families. For low and middle income families, their house is also the greatest source of wealth. The most common approach to measure the affordability of housing has been to consider the percentage of income that a household spends on housing expenditures. Another method of studying affordability looks at the regular hourly wage of full-time workers who are paid only the minimum wage (as set by their local, regional, or national government). The hope is that full-time workers will be able to afford at least a small apartment in the area where they work. Some countries look at those living in relative poverty, which is usually defined as making less than 60% of the median household income. In their policy reports, they consider the presence or absence of housing for people making 60% of the median income. Housing affordability can be measured by the changing relationships between house prices and rents, and between house prices and incomes. There has been an increase among policy makers in affordable housing as the price of housing has increased dramatically creating a crisis in affordable housing. Since 2000 the \"world experienced an unprecedented house price boom in terms of magnitude and duration, but also of synchronisation across countries.\" \"Never before had house prices risen so fast, for so long, in so many countries.\" Prices doubled in many countries and nearly tripled in Ireland. The bursting of the biggest financial bubble in history in 2008 wreaked havoc globally on the housing market. By 2011 home prices in Ireland had plunged by 45% from their peak in 2007. In the United States prices fell by 34% while foreclosures increased exponentially. In Spain and Denmark home prices dropped by 15%. However, in spite of the bust, home prices continue to be overvalued by about 25% or more in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Costs are being driven by a number of factors including:  A number of researchers argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased. Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace. In measuring affordability of housing there are various expenditures beyond the price of the actual housing stock itself, that are considered depending on the index being used. Some organizations and agencies consider the cost of purchasing a single-family home; others look exclusively at the cost of renting an apartment. Many U.S. studies, for example, focus primarily on the median cost of renting a two-bedroom apartment in a large apartment complex for a new tenant. These studies often lump together luxury apartments and slums, as well as desirable and undesirable neighborhoods. While this practice is known to distort the true costs, it is difficult to provide accurate information for the wide variety of situations without the report being unwieldy. Normally, only legal, permitted, separate housing is considered when calculating the cost of housing. The low rent costs for a room in a single family home, or an illegal garage conversion, or a college dormitory are generally excluded from the calculation, no matter how many people in an area live in such situations. Because of this study methodology, median housing costs tend to be slightly inflated. Costs are generally considered on a cash (not accrual) basis. Thus a person making the last payment on a large home mortgage might live in officially unaffordable housing one month, and very affordable housing the following month, when the mortgage is paid off. This distortion can be significant in areas where real estate costs are high, even if incomes are similarly high, because a high income allows a higher proportion of the income to be dedicated towards buying an expensive home without endangering the household's ability to buy food or other basic necessities. The majority of the more than seven billion people on earth now live in cities (UN). There are more than 500 city regions of more than one million inhabitants in the world. Cities become megacities become megalopolitan city regions and even \"galaxies\" of more than 60 million inhabitants. The Yangtze Delta-Greater Shanghai region now surpasses 80 million. Tokyo-Yokohoma adjacent to Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto have a combined population of 100 million. Rapid population growth leads to increased need for affordable housing in most cities. The availability of affordable housing in proximity of mass transit and linked to job distribution has become severely imbalanced in this period of rapid regional urbanization and growing density convergence. \"In addition to the distress it causes families who cannot find a place to live, lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have negative effects on a community's overall health.\" Affordable housing challenges in inner cities range from the homeless who are forced to live on the street to the relative deprivation of vital workers like police officers, firefighters, teachers and nurses unable to find affordable accommodation near their place of work. These workers are forced to live in suburbia, commuting up to two hours each way to work. Lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labour scarcer (as workers travel longer distances) (Pollard and Stanley 2007). Lack of affordable housing places a particular burden on local economies. As well, individual consumers are faced with mortgage arrears and excessive debt and therefore cut back on consumption. A combination of high housing costs and high debt levels contributes to a reduction in savings. These factors can lead to decreased investment in sectors that are essential to the long-term growth of the economy. In some countries, the market has been unable to meet the growing demand to supply housing stock at affordable prices. Although demand for affordable housing, particularly rental housing that is affordable for low and middle income earners, has increased, the supply has not. Potential home buyers are forced to turn to the rental market, which is also under pressure. An inadequate supply of housing stock increases demand on the private and social rented sector, and in worse case scenarios, homelessness.  In both large metropolitan areas and regional towns where housing prices are high, a lack of affordable housing places local firms at a competitive disadvantage. They are placed under wage pressures as they attempt to decrease the income/housing price gap. Key workers have fewer housing choices if prices rise to non-affordable levels. Variations in affordability of housing between areas may create labour market impediments. Potential workers are discouraged from moving to employment in areas of low affordability. They are also discouraged from migrating to areas of high affordability as the low house prices and rents indicate low capital gain potential and poor employment prospects. Housing affordability is more than just a personal trouble experienced by individual households who cannot easily find a place to live. Lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have negative effects on a community's overall health. Lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labor more scarce, and increase demands on transportation systems (as workers travel longer distances between jobs and affordable housing). Housing cost increases in U.S. cities have been linked to declines in enrollment at local schools. \"Faced with few affordable options, many people attempt to find less expensive housing by buying or renting farther out, but long commutes often result in higher transportation costs that erase any savings on shelter.\" Pollard (2010) called this the \"drive 'til you qualify\" approach, which causes far-flung development and forces people to drive longer distances to get to work, to get groceries, to take children to school, or to engage in other activities. A well located dwelling might save significant household travel costs and therefore improve overall family economics, even if the rent is higher than a dwelling in a poorer location.  A household's inhabitants must decide whether to pay more for housing to keep commuting time and expense low, or to accept a long or expensive commute to obtain \"better\" housing. The absolute availability of housing is not generally considered in the calculation of affordable housing. In a depressed or sparsely settled rural area, for example, the predicted price of the canonical median two-bedroom apartment may be quite easily affordable even to a minimum-wage worker – if only any apartments had ever been built. Some affordable housing prototypes include Nano House and Affordable Green Tiny House Project. Policy makers at all levels – global, national, regional, municipal, community associations – are attempting to respond to the issue of affordable housing, a highly complex crisis of global proportions, with a myriad of policy instruments. These responses range from stop-gap financing tools to long-term intergovernmental infrastructural changes. In the simplest of terms, affordability of housing refers to the amount of capital one has available in relation to the price of the goods to be obtained. Public policies are informed by underlying assumptions about the nature of housing itself. Is housing a basic need, a right, an entitlement, or a public good? Or is just another household-level consumer choice, a commodity or an investment within the free market system? \"Housing Policies provide a remarkable litmus test for the values of politicians at every level of office and of the varied communities that influence them. Often this test measures simply the warmth or coldness of heart of the more affluent and secure towards families of a lower socio-economic status (Bacher 1993:16).\" Affordable housing needs can be addressed through public policy instruments that focus on the demand side of the market, programs that help households reach financial benchmarks that make housing affordable. This can include approaches that simply promote economic growth in general—in the hope that a stronger economy, higher employment rates, and higher wages will increase the ability of households to acquire housing at market prices. Federal government policies define banking and mortgage lending practices, tax and regulatory measures affecting building materials, professional practices (ex. real estate transactions). The purchasing power of individual households can be enhanced through tax and fiscal policies that result in reducing the cost of mortgages and the cost of borrowing. Public policies may include the implementation of subsidy programs and incentive patterns for average households. For the most vulnerable groups, such as seniors, single-parent families, the disabled, etc. some form of publicly funded allowance strategy can be implemented providing individual households with adequate income to afford housing. Currently, policies that facilitate production on the supply side include favorable land use policies such as inclusionary zoning, relaxation of environmental regulations, and the enforcement of affordable housing quotas in new developments. In some countries, such as Canada, municipal governments began to play a greater role in developing and implementing policies regarding form and density of municipal housing in residential districts, as early as the 1950s. At the municipal level recently promoted policy tools include relaxation of prohibitions against accessory dwelling units, and reduction of the amount of parking that must be built for a new structure. Affordable housing is a controversial reality of contemporary life, for gains in affordability often result from expanding land available for housing or increasing the density of housing units in a given area. Ensuring a steady supply of affordable housing means ensuring that communities weigh real and perceived livability impacts against the sheer necessity of affordability. The process of weighing the impacts of locating affordable housing is quite contentious, and is laden with race and class implications. Recent research, however, suggests that proximity to low-income housing developments generally has a positive impact on neighborhood property conditions. The growing gap between rich and poor since the 1980s manifests itself in a housing system where public policy decisions privilege the ownership sector to the disadvantage of the rental sector. Ann Owen wonders if the housing market helped reduced poverty concentration in the National longitudinal data between the years of 1977–2008 with concentration of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Data information is to compare or intertwine with the differences of national housing subsidies, the entry, exit, and enhancement of low income housing. An article by Libertarian writer Virginia Postrel in the November 2007 issue of Atlantic Monthly reported on a study of the cost of obtaining the \"right to build\" (i.e. a building permit, red tape, bureaucracy, etc.) in different U.S. cities. The \"right to build\" cost does not include the cost of the land or the cost of constructing the house. The study was conducted by Harvard economists Edward Glaeser and Kristina Tobio. According to the chart accompanying the article, the cost of obtaining the \"right to build\" adds approximately $600,000 to the cost of each new house that is built in San Francisco. The study, cited, published by Ed Glaeser and Joe Gyourko, reached its conclusion about the value of right to build in different localities based on a methodology of comparing the cost of single family homes on quarter-acre versus half-acre lots to get a marginal land price and then comparing the selling price of homes to construction costs to get a price for land plus other costs, with the difference between the two being attributed to the cost of zoning and other local government permitting and regulations. Many governments put restrictions on the size or cost of a dwelling that people can live in, making it essentially illegal to live permanently in a house that is too small, low-cost or not compliant with other government-defined requirements. Generally, these laws are implemented in an attempt to raise the perceived \"standard\" of housing across the country. This can lead to thousands of houses across a country being left empty for much of the year even when there is a great need for more affordable housing; such is the case in countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, where there is a common tradition to have a summer house. This sometimes raises concerns for the respect of rights such as the right to utilize one's property. In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit, resulting in having \"outlawed the bottom end of the private housing market, driving up rents on everything above it.\"  The challenges of promoting affordable housing varies by location.", "HUD-1 Settlement Statement\nHUD-1 Settlement Statement The HUD-1 Settlement Statement was a standard form in use in the United States of America which was used to itemize services and fees charged to the borrower by the lender or broker when applying for a loan for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing real estate. HUD refers to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The borrower had the right to inspect the HUD-1 one day prior to day of settlement. The form would have been filled out by the settlement agent who would conduct the settlement. Beginning in 2010, the HUD-1 settlement statement also contained what was referred to as a Good Faith Estimate or GFE. This additional set of figures specified estimated settlement figures provided by the lender upon application of the loan.

USA House was undertaken by the U.S. government at the behest of the British government under the terms of the Lend Lease Act. At the time, the United States was considered the world leader in prefabricated building techniques; a 1943 proposal by the Union of Soviet Architects had even suggested the purchase of American prefabrication technologies to deal with the Soviet Union's own housing dilemmas. Details of the arrangement were brokered by John Maynard Keynes. According to a period news report, the program was designed to \"help shelter England's bombed-out population\". Initial plans called for the construction of 30,000 homes in the United States which would be shipped to, and assembled in, Great Britain. The first of the bungalow-style homes constructed for the program were erected in the UK during the summer of 1945. The program suffered, early on, from domestic United States criticism. Americans voiced opposition to the amount of lumber resources being devoted to foreign aid projects and expressed incredulity that war measures such as Lend Lease were being used to aid \"everyday Britons\". In the UK the program was also received skeptically after the first shipment of houses arrived damaged. Design factors of the buildings were also met with disfavor by Britons. For instance, the USA House was outfitted with an American-style bathtub, which is shorter and more shallow than the type used in Britain. Despite the original program goal of 30,000 homes, only 8,462 were ultimately supplied. According to a period report to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, the British government cancelled the remaining order of 22,000 units following the termination of Lend Lease by the United States and due to Britain's inability to pay the full price of each house. Contemporary accounts attribute a variety of structural deficiencies in the buildings, such as differences in the foundation slab between the USA House and that of locally-built British temporary shelters, as contributing to the British government decision not to see the program through to completion.

{"query": "Lars Onsager Nobel Prize in Chemistry instead of Ising model solution", "pos": ["Lars Onsager\nLars Onsager Lars Onsager (November 27, 1903 – October 5, 1976) was a Norwegian-born American physical chemist and theoretical physicist. He held the Gibbs Professorship of Theoretical Chemistry at Yale University. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968. Lars Onsager was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His father was a lawyer. After completing secondary school in Oslo, he attended the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim, graduating as a chemical engineer in 1925. In 1925 he arrived at a correction to the Debye-Hückel theory of electrolytic solutions, to specify Brownian movement of ions in solution, and during 1926 published it. He traveled to Zürich, where Peter Debye was teaching, and confronted Debye, telling him his theory was wrong. He impressed Debye so much that he was invited to become Debye's assistant at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH), where he remained until 1928. Eventually in 1928 he went to the United States to take a faculty position at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. At JHU he had to teach freshman classes in chemistry, and it quickly became apparent that, while he was a genius at developing theories in physical chemistry, he had little talent for teaching. He was dismissed by JHU after one semester. On leaving JHU, he accepted a position (involving the teaching of statistical mechanics to graduate students in chemistry) at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where it became clear that he was no better at teaching advanced students than freshmen, but he made significant contributions to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The only graduate student who could really understand his lectures on electrolyte systems, Raymond Fuoss, worked under him and eventually joined him on the Yale chemistry faculty.  In 1933, when the Great Depression limited Brown's ability to support a faculty member who was only useful as a researcher and not a teacher, he was let go by Brown, being hired after a trip to Europe by Yale University, where he remained for most of the rest of his life, retiring in 1972. His research at Brown was concerned mainly with the effects on diffusion of temperature gradients, and produced the Onsager reciprocal relations, a set of equations published in 1929 and, in an expanded form, in 1931, in statistical mechanics whose importance went unrecognized for many years. However, their value became apparent during the decades following World War II, and by 1968 they were considered important enough to gain Onsager that year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1933, just before taking up the position at Yale, Onsager traveled to Austria to visit electrochemist Hans Falkenhagen. He met Falkenhagen's sister-in-law, Margrethe Arledter. They were married on September 7, 1933, and had three sons and a daughter. At Yale, an embarrassing situation occurred: he had been hired as a postdoctoral fellow, but it was discovered that he had never received a Ph.D. While he had submitted an outline of his work in reciprocal relations to the Norwegian Institute of Technology, they had decided it was too incomplete to qualify as a doctoral dissertation. He was told that he could submit one of his published papers to the Yale faculty as a dissertation, but insisted on doing a new research project instead. His dissertation, entitled, \"Solutions of the Mathieu equation of period 4 pi and certain related functions\", was beyond the comprehension of the chemistry and physics faculty, and only when some members of the mathematics department, including the chairman, insisted that the work was good enough that \"they\" would grant the doctorate if the chemistry department would not, was he granted a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1935. Even before the dissertation was finished, he was appointed assistant professor in 1934, and promoted to associate professor in 1940. He quickly showed at Yale the same traits he had at JHU and Brown: he produced brilliant theoretical research, but was incapable of giving a lecture at a level that a student (even a graduate student) could comprehend. He was also unable to direct the research of graduate students, except for the occasional outstanding one. During the late 1930s, Onsager researched the dipole theory of dielectrics, making improvements for another topic that had been studied by Peter Debye. However, when he submitted his paper to a journal that Debye edited in 1936, it was rejected. Debye would not accept Onsager's ideas until after World War II. During the 1940s, Onsager studied the statistical-mechanical theory of phase transitions in solids, deriving a mathematically elegant theory which was enthusiastically received. In what is widely considered a tour de force of mathematical physics, he obtained the exact solution for the two dimensional Ising model in zero field in 1944. In 1960 he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor techn. honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In 1945, Onsager was naturalized as an American citizen, and the same year he was awarded the title of \"J. Willard Gibbs Professor of Theoretical Chemistry\". This was particularly appropriate because Onsager, like Willard Gibbs, had been involved primarily in the application of mathematics to problems in physics and chemistry and, in a sense, could be considered to be continuing in the same areas Gibbs had pioneered. In 1947, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1950 he joined the ranks of Alpha Chi Sigma. After World War II, Onsager researched new topics of interest.  He proposed a theoretical explanation of the superfluid properties of liquid helium in 1949; two years later the physicist Richard Feynman independently proposed the same theory. He also worked on the theories of liquid crystals and the electrical properties of ice. While on a Fulbright scholarship to the University of Cambridge, he worked on the magnetic properties of metals. He developed important ideas on the quantization of magnetic flux in metals. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1958, Willard Gibbs Award in 1962, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1975. In 1972 Onsager retired from Yale and became emeritus. He then became a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, and was appointed Distinguished University Professor of Physics. At the University of Miami he remained active in guiding and inspiring postdoctoral students as his teaching skills, although not his lecturing skills, had improved during the course of his career. He developed interests in semiconductor physics, biophysics and radiation chemistry. However, his death came before he could produce any breakthroughs comparable to those of his earlier years. He remained in Florida until his death from an aneurysm in Coral Gables, Florida in 1976. Onsager was buried next to John Gamble Kirkwood at New Haven's Grove Street Cemetery. While Kirkwood's tombstone has a long list of awards and positions, including the American Chemical Society Award in Pure Chemistry, the Richards Medal, and the Lewis Award, Onsager's tombstone, in its original form, simply said \"Nobel Laureate\". When Onsager's wife Gretel died in 1991 and was buried there, his children added an asterisk after \"Nobel Laureate,\" and \"*etc.\" in the lower right corner of the stone. The Norwegian Institute of Technology established the Lars Onsager Lecture and The Lars Onsager Professorship in 1993 to award outstanding scientists in the scientific fields of Lars Onsager; Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics.

The organization helps malnourished children and provides communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger. In 2014, Action Against Hunger worked in 49 different countries around the world with more than 6,000 employees and volunteers helping 13.6 million people in need. Action Against Hunger was established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Alfred Kastler served as the organization's first chairman. The group initially provided assistance to Afghan refugees in Pakistan, famine-stricken Ugandan communities, and Cambodian refugees in Thailand. It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger's Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula (F100), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat acute malnutrition. As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%. A few years later, therapeutic milk was repackaged as ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), a peanut-based paste packaged like a power bar. These bars allow for the treatment of malnutrition at home, and do not require any preparation or refrigeration. The international network currently has headquarters in five countries – France, Spain, the United States, Canada, and the UK. Its four main areas of work include nutrition, food security, water and sanitation, and advocacy. Action Against Hunger saves lives by preventing, detecting and treating severe acute malnutrition, particularly in emergency and conflicts situations. The organisation has an integrated approach with various sectors of intervention: Action Against Hunger partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to global hunger. Each year, several campaigns are ran by the network to raise funds and support the organisation's programs : Restaurants Against Hunger and Love Food Give Food. In 2017, Action Against Hunger International Network is present in 51 countries: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroun, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Soudan, Tanzania, Chad, Zimbabwe Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines Haïti South Caucasus, Turkey, Ukraine Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestinian Occupied Territories, Yemen, Jordan, Iraq Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru Since 1995 Action Against Hunger developed an international network to have a bigger global impact.

This fresh produce is then distributed to food banks throughout the west coast of the United States. Ag Against Hunger was the brainchild of Jess Brown, Executive Director of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau, Willy Elliott-McCrae, Executive Director of Second Harvest Food Bank and Tim Driscoll of Driscoll Strawberry Associates. In 1990 they developed a system to distribute the abundance of surplus crops grown in the tri-county area to the hungry. Their simple solution has become a model for produce recovery and distribution programs. Ag Against Hunger's trucks collect produce from approximately 50 different growers and shippers in the tri-county area. It is then distributed to food banks that make the fresh produce donations available to more than 240 nonprofit human service agencies and feeds 75,000 low-income people in the tri-county area each month and hundreds of thousands more throughout California and the West Coast. When local food banks are satisfied, Ag Against Hunger provides California Emergency Foodlink, a statewide food distribution program, fresh produce which is distributed to over 50 food banks and community pantries in other parts of the state. After state organizations receive all the produce they needed, Ag Against Hunger works with food organizations in Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Utah to feed people throughout the West Coast. After harvest, there is an abundance of high quality, marketable produce left in the fields which cannot be harvested economically or does not meet commercial standards. Typically, it is tilled under in preparation for planting new crops. Ag Against Hunger’s gleaning program coordinates the picking of crops left behind after commercial harvest and the donation of the food. In 2006, volunteers harvested over 55,000 pounds of produce that would have otherwise been disked underground."]}
{"query": "Whiskey Row economic impact on Louisville instead of historical architecture", "pos": ["Economy of Louisville, Kentucky\nEconomy of Louisville, Kentucky Louisville, Kentucky, today is home to dozens of companies and organizations across several industrial classifications. However, the underpinning of the economy of Louisville since it earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries. The city's location at the Falls of the Ohio, and its unique position in the central United States (within one day's road travel to 60% of the cities in the continental U.S.) makes it favorable for the transfer of cargo. In the early days, the Louisville and Portland Canal (the McAlpine Locks and Dam is built in this canal) was a crucial link in water traffic on its route from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (and other origins) to the mouth of the Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico, and beyond. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad was also an important link between the industrialized northern cities and the South. Louisville's importance to the shipping industry continues today with the presence of the Worldport air hub for UPS. The city's location at the crossroads of three major Interstate highways (I-64, I-65 and I-71) also contributes to its modern-day strategic importance to the shipping and cargo industry. In addition, the Port of Louisville continues Louisville's river shipping presence at Jefferson Riverport International. As of 2003, Louisville ranks as the seventh-largest inland port in the United States. Louisville has emerged as a major center for the health care and medical sciences industries. Louisville has been central to advancements in heart and hand surgery as well as cancer treatment. Some of the first artificial heart and hand transplants were conducted in Louisville. The James Graham Brown Cancer Center is well-renowned. The city's thriving downtown medical research campus includes a new $88 million rehabilitation center and a health sciences research and commercialization park, that in partnership with the University of Louisville, has lured nearly 70 top scientists and researchers. Louisville is also home to Humana, one of the nation's largest health insurance companies. Louisville is a significant center of manufacturing. Within the city's limits are two major Ford plants, namely the Kentucky Truck Plant and the Louisville Assembly Plant. Also located in the city is the headquarters and major home appliance factory of GE Appliances (a subsidiary of Haier). The city is a major center of the American whiskey industry, with about one-third of all bourbon coming from Louisville. Brown-Forman, one of the major makers of American whiskey, is headquartered in Louisville and operates a distillery in the Louisville suburb of Shively. The current primary distillery site operated by Heaven Hill, called the Bernheim distillery, is also located in Louisville near Brown-Forman's distillery. Other distilleries and related businesses can also be found in neighboring cities in Kentucky, Barton 1792 (Bardstown), Jim Beam (Clermont), Wild Turkey (Lawrenceburg), or Maker's Mark (Loretto, with a restaurant/lounge in Louisville). Similar to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail that links these central Kentucky locations, Louisville offers tourists its own \"Urban Bourbon Trail\", where people can stop at nearly 20 \"area bars and restaurants, all offering at least 50 labels of America's only native spirit.\" Craft beer is an increasingly profitable business for the city, home to over 14 locally owned breweries including Bluegrass Brewing Company and Falls City Brewing Company. In 2013 overall beer sales were reported to be down 2% from the previous year, whereas craft beer sales had risen 18%. To keep up the demand, Mayor Greg Fischer announced in 2015 plans to create \"Lou Brew\": a tour, similar to the Urban Bourbon Trail, that will highlight the local breweries and craft beer scene of Louisville to both natives and tourists. Not typically known for high tech outside of the previously identified industries, Louisville in the 2010s has been at or near the forefront of some high-tech-related developments. In April 2017, Google Fiber confirmed that the city will be wired for its ultrafast network. Meanwhile, since October 2016, AT&T Fiber has been building out its similar service in the city as well as neighboring counties in Indiana. Beyond networking, the city, through its public–private partnership called Code Louisville, recognized by President Barack Obama, is aiding area residents in the learning of software coding skills. Louisville prides itself in its large assortment of small, independent businesses and restaurants, some of which have become known for their ingenuity and creativity. In 1926 the Brown Hotel became the home of the Hot Brown \"sandwich\". A few blocks away, the Seelbach Hotel, which F. Scott Fitzgerald references in \"The Great Gatsby\", is also famous for a secret back room where Al Capone would regularly meet with associates during the Prohibition era. The room features a secret back door escape and was used as a starting point for rumrunners who would transport illegal moonshine from the hills of eastern Kentucky to Chicago. Also, in 1880, John Colgan invented a way to make chewing gum taste better for a longer period of time. The Highlands area of Louisville on Bardstown Road has many independent businesses, including the Preston Arts Center, Baxter Avenue Theater, Carmichael's book store, Heine Brothers' Coffee, John Conti Coffee, Wick's Pizza, Steilberg's String Instruments and O'Shea's Irish Pub, among others. Several local breweries such as Milewide Brewing, Gravely Brewing, Great Flood Brewery, Akasha, Apocolypse, Holsopple, New Albanian Brewery of New Albany, Indiana, Browning's Restaurant and Brewery, Cumberland Brews, and the Bluegrass Brewing Company offer an assortment of local brewing talent in the area. Louisville has connections to the entertainment industry. Several major motion pictures have also been filmed in or near Louisville, including \"The Insider\", \"Goldfinger\", \"Stripes\", \"Lawn Dogs\", \"Elizabethtown\", \"Demolition Man\", and \"Secretariat\". Also located in Louisville is a branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Louisville for a long time was also home to the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company, at its peak one of the largest manufacturers and wholesale distributors of hardware in the United States, as well as Brown & Williamson, the third largest company in the tobacco industry before merging with R. J. Reynolds in 2004 to form the Reynolds American Company. Brands such as KOOL, Viceroy, Capri, Misty and Raleigh were introduced in Louisville. Brown & Williamson, one of the subjects of the tobacco industry scandals of the 1990s, was the focus of \"The Insider\", a 1999 film shot around the Louisville area.", "Wright and Taylor Building\nWright and Taylor Building The Wright and Taylor Building is a historic building located in the central business district of Louisville, Kentucky.

It is centered along a three-mile stretch of Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue (US 31E/US 150) and is so named because it sits atop a ridge between the middle and south forks of Beargrass Creek. The commercial area extends from the intersection of Bardstown Road and Taylorsville Road/Trevillian Way in the south, to the intersection of Baxter Avenue and Lexington Road in the north, a length of 3.2 miles. A 1/2 mile section of nearby Barret Avenue also contains many similar businesses. The residential area is separated from other adjacent areas like Germantown and Crescent Hill by the south and north forks of Beargrass Creek. The middle fork runs through Cherokee Park, and the south fork divides Germantown from Tyler Park, after flowing past several cemeteries and undeveloped forests downstream from Joe Creason Park. Due to its large collection of night clubs and restaurants, it is locally known as \"Restaurant Row\". The grid of streets east and west of Bardstown Road are mostly single-family residences and range from working-class neighborhoods to some of the most expensive streets in Louisville, such as Spring Drive. In 2000, the Highlands had a population of nearly 33,000. The Highlands was the last area near downtown Louisville to be urbanized, since its steep 60 foot incline above the flood plain made travel difficult, and the area showed no signs of urban development until just before the Civil War. Several notable families did own plantations in what is now called the Highlands, spurred by the Louisville and Bardstown Turnpike (today's Bardstown Road). The turnpike was first planned as early as 1784, but authorization to begin construction was delayed until 1819, and thwarted then by the Panic of 1819. Funds were finally allocated in 1829, with construction beginning in 1832. Bardstown Road was originally a turnpike (with a macadamized surface), and tolls were collected at toll gates along the way. The portion of the road nearest to Louisville was free, so as Louisville grew, the first gatehouse moved further out. The earliest was at Beargrass Creek; it then moved to what is now the intersection of Broadway and Baxter, and subsequently to what is today Patterson and Bardstown, then to Eastern Parkway and Bardstown by 1873. It was at Speed Avenue by 1901, when the turnpike was sold to the city. The second tollgate was permanently located near today's Bashford Manor Lane and Bardstown. While the landowners were families of English descent, many of the first residents during the agricultural days were Germans, which gave the area the nickname New Hamburg. Large-scale residential development didn't begin in the area until a streetcar line extended to the area near the present-day intersection of Bardstown and Baxter in the 1890s. Nearby Cave Hill Cemetery (which doubled as park) and Cherokee Park provided recreation for the new residents. Many businesses formed along the turnpike, with residential development back off the main road. The growth would creep down Bardstown Road as the streetcar lines continued to be extended. By the 1930s, the entire area today called the Highlands had been developed. The streetcars last ran down Bardstown Road on Derby Day 1947, and were replaced by buses. The area would continue to thrive until the 1960s, when some of the wealthier residents left for the suburbs. The main business corridor along Bardstown Road suffered, with residents expressing serious concerns about its quality in 1974. Of particular concern was the neglected Mid-City Mall, with frequent complaints about crime and its deteriorated appearance due to lack of maintenance. Four neighborhood associations organized a boycott of the mall starting in February 1975, and partly as a result, foreclosure on the mall began in late 1976. It was placed in receivership in 1977, and the mall has been considerably improved in the following decades. The cooperation that led to the boycott created a strong community sentiment that the right changes could be made along the business corridor. Many older buildings had been razed already to make space for more modern fast-food restaurants and drive-in banks, and there was concern that nothing would remain eventually of the streetcar suburb era corridor. This led to the creation of the Highlands Commerce Guild in 1977. The Highlands area would begin to rebound commercially in the 1980s as antique shops and other \"oddity\" stores moved to Bardstown Road for the many vacant store fronts which were located right off the street and for the area's elegant architecture. Many young professionals were also attracted to the area for its location near downtown and amenities such as Cherokee Park and pedestrian-friendly shopping. By the early 1990s the area had become the city's main nightclub and upscale restaurant district, as well as the cultural center for the city's music and gay scene. Today many of its neighborhoods have among the highest percentage of college graduates and average income in Louisville. Neighborhood income and education levels are highest in the areas farthest from the city center, and gradually decrease heading toward downtown. The gentrification of the Highlands has also had a spillover effect on adjacent areas such as Butchertown and Clifton, as they developed their own upscale club and shopping districts. In the 2000s the Highlands has continued to thrive, as several new mixed-use developments and additional restaurants have been established. An area of contention with some residents is whether there is too great a density of bars and nightclubs, particularly in the 900 block of Baxter Avenue. In 2004, some residents of the Original Highlands threatened a wet-dry vote to prevent more bars (in particular \"The Monkey Wrench\") from opening along Barret Avenue; they also sought stricter enforcement of rules regarding the percentage of revenue made from alcoholic sales; which is designed to prevent a high density of bars in a given area. This followed complaints of increased vandalism and crime, as well as complaints that many of the patrons were parking on residential streets. After an increase in police patrols, the problems ceased and talk of the vote ended. The highlands area had a population of about 14,236 when the census bureau last took count in 2010. The population consists mostly of people from the ages of 20-39 years old. The area tailors itself to these demographics. Highlands consists of Bardstown Road all the way to Baxter avenue. There is a variety of restaurants and places to get a drink. Some of the more common bars are Baxter's, Highland Tap room , Akikos and Nowhere bar. The Bardstown Road streetcar line ran until 1947 and was gradually extended farther out as the neighborhood expanded. The densest commercial areas in the Highlands were located along these stops, though many of the buildings at the older ones have since been razed, and the density is less evident: Before the era of multiplexes, small single-screen theatres dominated. Several in Louisville were located along Bardstown Road and were popular sources of entertainment in the Highlands for decades.  Today, the Highlands has an 8-screen multiplex, Baxter Avenue Filmworks, located in Mid-City Mall. The complex opened in 1996 as Baxter Avenue Theatres.  Several small cities further southwest on Bardstown Road define themselves as the Upper Highlands, and had sixth-class city status before Kentucky radically simplified its city classification system in 2015:"]}

This film version is funded by the UK Film Council and Film4, produced by Sean O'Connor and Kate Ogborn. Filming began in late 2010 and it was released in the United Kingdom in 2011, the year of Rattigan's centenary. It was released in the United States in 2012 by distributor Music Box Films. In 1950, Hester Collyer, the younger wife of High Court judge Sir William Collyer, has embarked on a passionate affair with Freddie Page, a handsome young former RAF pilot troubled by his memories of the Second World War. Freddie throws Hester's life in turmoil, as their erotic relationship leaves her emotionally stranded and physically isolated. For Freddie, that tumultuous mix of fear and excitement that was once in his life seems to be no longer present. The majority of the film takes place during one day in Hester's flat, a day on which she has decided to commit suicide. Her suicide attempt fails and as she recovers, the story of her affair and her married life is played out in a mosaic of short and sporadic flashbacks. We soon discover the constraints of Hester's comfortable marriage, which is affectionate but without sexual passion. As Hester's affair is discovered she leaves her life of comparative luxury and moves into a small dingy London flat with Freddie. Hester's new lover has awakened her sexuality, but the reckless, thrill-seeking Freddie can never give her the love and stability that her husband gave her. Yet to return to a life without passion would be unbearable. The film takes its title from her dilemma of being caught between the Devil and the deep blue sea – two equally undesirable situations.  Filming locations are all in London, England (UK). The Three Mills Studios was used, Three Mill Lane, Bow, London. The orchestral background music is taken from Samuel Barber's violin concerto written 1939. The film was released to strongly positive reviews from critics.

He was the founder of Sun Records and Sun Studio, in Memphis, Tennessee, where he produced recordings by Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Howlin' Wolf. He launched Presley's career in 1954. Phillips sold Sun in 1969 to Shelby Singleton. He was an early investor in the Holiday Inn chain of hotels. He owned and operated radio stations in Memphis; Florence, Alabama; and Lake Worth, Florida. He advocated for racial equality and helped break down racial barriers in the music industry. Phillips was the youngest of eight children, born on a farm near Florence, Alabama, to poor tenant farmers, Madge Ella (Lovelace) and Charles Tucker Phillips. As a child, he picked cotton in the fields with his parents alongside black laborers. The experience of hearing workers singing in the fields left a big impression on the young Phillips. Traveling through Memphis with his family in 1939 on the way to see a preacher in Dallas, he slipped off to look at Beale Street, at the time the heart of the city's music scene. \"I just fell totally in love,\" he later recalled. Phillips attended the former Coffee High School in Florence. He conducted the school band and had ambitions to be a criminal defense attorney. However, his father was bankrupted by the Great Depression and died in 1941, forcing Phillips to leave high school to look after his mother and aunt. To support the family he worked in a grocery store and then a funeral parlor. In 1942, Sam, 19, met Rebecca \"Becky\" Burns, 17, his future wife, while they were both working at WLAY radio station in Sheffield, Alabama. He was an announcer and she was still in high school and had a radio segment with her sister as 'The Kitchen Sisters' where they played music and sang. A January 18, 2013 article in the Alabama Chanin Journal honoring Becky quoted Sam as saying, \"I fell in love with Becky's voice even before I met her.\" Becky described her first encounter with Sam to journalist Peter Guralnick: \"He had just come in out of the rain. His hair was windblown and full of raindrops. He wore sandals and a smile unlike any I had ever seen. He sat down on the piano bench and began to talk to me. I told my family that night that I had met the man I wanted to marry.\" They wed in 1943 and went on to produce two children in a marriage that lasted 60 years until Sam's death in 2003. Widow Becky Phillips died in 2012, aged 87. In the 1940s, Phillips worked as a DJ and radio engineer for station WLAY (AM), in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. According to Phillips, the station's \"open format\" (of broadcasting music by white and black musicians alike) would later inspire his work in Memphis. Beginning in 1945, he worked for four years as an announcer and sound engineer for radio station WREC, in Memphis. On January 3, 1950, Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service, at 706 Union Avenue in Memphis. He let amateurs record, which drew performers such as B.B. King, Junior Parker, and Howlin' Wolf, who made their first recordings there. Phillips then sold the recordings to larger labels. In addition to musical performances, Phillips recorded events such as weddings and funerals, selling the recordings. The Memphis Recording Service also served as the studio for Phillips's own label, Sun Record Company, which he launched in 1952. Phillips recorded different styles of music. He was interested in the blues and said, \"The blues, it got people—black and white—to think about life, how difficult, yet also how good it can be. They would sing about it; they would pray about it; they would preach about it. This is how they relieved the burden of what existed day in and day out.\" Phillips recorded what the music historian Peter Guralnick considered the first rock and roll record: \"Rocket 88\", by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, a band led by the 19-year-old Ike Turner, who also wrote the song. The recording was released in 1951 by Chess Records, of Chicago. From 1950 to 1954 Phillips recorded music by James Cotton, Rufus Thomas, Rosco Gordon, Little Milton, Bobby Blue Bland, the Prisonaires and others. Sun Records produced more rock-and-roll records than any other record label of its time during its 16-year run, producing 226 singles. Phillips and Elvis Presley opened a new form of music. Phillips said of Presley: \"Elvis cut a ballad, which was just excellent. I could tell you, both Elvis and Roy Orbison could tear a ballad to pieces. But I said to myself, 'You can't do that, Sam.' If I had released a ballad I don't think you would have heard of Elvis Presley.\" Much has been written about Phillips's goals, but he stated that \"everyone knew that I was just a struggling cat down here trying to develop new and different artists, and get some freedom in music, and tap some resources and people that weren't being tapped.\" He didn't care about mistakes; he cared about the feel. Phillips met Presley through the mediation of his longtime collaborator at the Memphis Recording Service, Marion Keisker, who was already a well-known Memphis radio personality. On 18 July 1953, the eighteen-year-old Presley dropped into the studio to record an acetate for his mother's birthday; Keisker thought she heard some talent in the young truck driver's voice, and so she turned on the tape recorder. Later, she played it for Phillips, who gradually, with Keisker's encouragement, warmed to the idea of recording Elvis. Presley, who recorded his version of Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup's \"That's All Right\" at Phillips's studio, became highly successful, first in Memphis, then throughout the southern United States. He auditioned for Phillips in 1954, but it was not until he sang \"That's All Right (Mama)\" that Phillips was impressed. He brought the song to Dewey Phillips, a disc jockey at WHBQ 560, to play on his \"Red, Hot & Blue\" program. For the first six months, the flip side, \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", Presley's upbeat version of a Bill Monroe bluegrass song, was slightly more popular than \"That's All Right (Mama).\" While still not known outside the South, Presley's singles and regional success became a drawing card for Sun Records, as singing hopefuls soon arrived from all over the region. Singers such as Sonny Burgess (\"My Bucket's Got a Hole in It\"), Charlie Rich, Junior Parker, and Billy Lee Riley recorded for Sun with some success, and others, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, BB King, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Carl Perkins, became stars. Phillips's pivotal role in the early days of rock and roll was exemplified by a celebrated jam session on December 4, 1956, with what became known as the Million Dollar Quartet. Jerry Lee Lewis was playing piano for a Carl Perkins recording session at Phillips's studio. When Elvis Presley walked in unexpectedly, Johnny Cash was called into the studio by Phillips, leading to an impromptu session featuring the four musicians. Phillips challenged the four to achieve gold record sales, offering a free Cadillac to the first, which Carl Perkins won. The contest is commemorated in a song by the Drive-By Truckers. By the mid-1960s, Phillips rarely recorded. He built a satellite studio and opened radio stations, but the studio declined, and he sold Sun Records to Shelby Singleton in 1969. In 1977 Sam's sons, Knox and Jerry, were working with John Prine at the Phillips Recording Studio when Sam Phillips joined them to oversee recordings that were eventually included on the album \"Pink Cadillac\". Phillips launched radio station WHER on October 29, 1955. Each of the young women who auditioned for the station assumed there would only be one female announcer position, as was the case with other stations at that time. Only a few days before the first broadcast did they learn of the all-female format. It was the first all-female radio station in the United States, as almost every position at the station was held by a woman. In 1950, he started a short-lived record label called \"It's the Phillips\". Through shrewd investments, Phillips amassed a fortune. He was one of the first investors in Holiday Inn, a motel chain that was about to expand to a nationwide franchise; he became involved with the chain shortly after selling Elvis Presley's contract to RCA, for $35,000, which he multiplied many times over the years with Holiday Inn. He also created two subsidiary recording labels, Phillips International Records and Holiday Inn Records. He owned the Sun Studio Café in Memphis. One location was in the Mall of Memphis. Phillips and his family founded Big River Broadcasting Corporation, which owns and operates several radio stations in the Florence, Alabama, area, including WQLT-FM, WSBM, and WXFL. He also established radio station WLIZ in Lake Worth, Florida, in 1959. In 1986 Sam Phillips was part of the first group inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was the first non-performer inducted. In 1987, he was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. He received a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement in 1991. In 1998, he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, in October 2001 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 2012 he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Memphis Music Hall of Fame. Phillips died of respiratory failure at St. Francis Hospital in Memphis, on July 30, 2003, only one day before the original Sun Studio was designated a National Historic Landmark, and just over a month before the death of former Sun Records recording star Johnny Cash, on September 12, 2003. Phillips is interred in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis.", "Phillips Recording\nPhillips Recording Phillips Recording is the short name widely used to refer to the Sam C. Phillips Recording Studio opened at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, by Sam Phillips in 1960. Internationally regarded at that time as a state-of-the-art facility, it was built to fill the needs of the Sun Records recording label that the older, smaller Sun Records Studio was no longer able to handle.  This Memphis studio was originally a division of a larger corporation, Sam Phillips Recording Service, Inc., which also briefly included under its umbrella a Nashville studio, where famed CBS Records producer Billy Sherrill got his start, and a studio in Tupelo, Mississippi for demos. The Nashville and Tupelo studios were short-lived. Sun Records' many artists recorded there until 1969, when the label was sold to Mercury Records producer Shelby Singleton of Nashville. Phillips Recording continued operating, and hosted recordings by a newer generation of rock-and-roll groups like the Cramps, starting in 1979, drawn in part by the mystique of Sam Phillips.  Numerous Memphis veteran sessions musicians of several genres, from soul to country, rock and others, have worked there over the years, and the studio still records various musical styles. Sam Phillips' son Knox Phillips has overseen the studio's operations in recent years."], "neg": ["Eddie Phillips (musician)\nEddie Phillips (musician) Edwin Michael \"Eddie\" Phillips (born 15 August 1945, Leytonstone, London) is a British guitarist who rose to some prominence during the 1960s. He is best known for his work with The Creation. He was one of the figureheads of the new wave of British guitar heroes, and it was reported that Pete Townshend asked him to join The Who as a second guitarist, although this is now believed to be a 1960s publicity story and Phillips has regularly denied any knowledge of the invitation. \"If he asked me, I didn't hear him,\" said Phillips in a 1988 interview with Chris Hunt of \"Guitarist\" magazine. \"I think that was a bit of sharp press.\"  Phillips was the first guitarist to use a violin bow with a guitar, a technique he experimented with while in his first band the Mark Four and he perfected the style with The Creation, committing the sound to vinyl on The Creation's only UK chart hits, \"Making Time\" and \"Painter Man\", both released in 1966. Although Phillips was the originator, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin later popularised the technique to a wider audience, leading many to erroneously believe that Page, and not Phillips, was the pioneer of the style. Apart from being a guitarist, Phillips was also an accomplished songwriter and singer. He helped pen many of The Creation's best known songs, such as \"Painter Man\" and \"Making Time\". Successful cover versions of his songs include the UK top ten hit \"Painter Man\" by Boney M and \"Teacher Teacher\" by Rockpile. \"Making Time\" was featured on the Rushmore movie soundtrack. After leaving The Creation (he was replaced briefly by Ronnie Wood), Phillips joined P. P. Arnold's TNT Soul Band on bass, featuring on her hit \"Angel Of The Morning\" and the album \"Kafunta\" before quitting music and reportedly becoming a bus driver. He reunited with The Creation's producer Shel Talmy in the 1970s, releasing the single \"Limbo Jimbo\". In 1979 he teamed up with former Creation singer Kenny Pickett as Kennedy Express, recording two singles. Pickett and Phillips later reunited the original Creation lineup in 1993, resulting in a series of dates and a studio album before Pickett's death in 1996. Phillips is still writing, recording and playing live with the reformed Creation (which for a time included original member Bob Garner). In recent years The Creation toured the UK, the US and parts of Europe."]}
{"query": "Flashdance musical history beyond Paris production", "pos": ["Dance music\nDance music Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise. Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western ballroom and social dance music. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, Swing music was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, rock and roll became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of soul and R&B music. The rise of disco in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, electronic dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in nightclubs, radio stations, shows and raves. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Folk dance music is music accompanying traditional dance and may be contrasted with historical/classical, and popular/commercial dance music. An example of folk dance music in the United States is the old-time music played at square dances and contra dances. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances such as carols and the Estampie. The earliest of these surviving dances are almost as old as Western staff-based music notation. The Renaissance dance music was written for instruments such as the lute, viol, tabor, pipe, and the sackbut. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). Examples of dances include the French courante, sarabande, minuet and gigue. Collections of dances were often collected together as dance suites. In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement in four-movement non-vocal works such as sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era, as the minuet evolved into the scherzo (literally, \"joke\"; a faster-paced minuet). Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka and polonaise. Also in the romantic music era, the growth and development of ballet extended the composition of dance music to a new height. Frequently, dance music was a part of opera. Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western ballroom and social dance music. Dance music works often bear the name of the corresponding dance, e.g. waltzes, the tango, the bolero, the can-can, minuets, salsa, various kinds of jigs and the breakdown. Other dance forms include contradance, the merengue (Dominican Republic), and the cha-cha-cha. Often it is difficult to know whether the name of the music came first or the name of the dance. Ballads are commonly chosen for slow-dance routines. However ballads have been commonly deemed as the opposite of dance music in terms of their tempo. Originally, the ballad was a type of dance as well (hence the name \"ballad\", from the same root as \"ballroom\" and \"ballet\"). Ballads are still danced on the Faeroe Islands. \"Dansband\" (\"Dance band\") is a term in Swedish for bands who play a kind of popular music, \"dansbandsmusik\" (\"Dance band music\"), to partner dance to. These terms came into use around 1970, and before that, many of the bands were classified as \"pop groups\". This type of music is mostly popular in the Nordic countries. Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It was most popular during the mid to late 1970s, though it has had brief resurgences afterwards. It inspired the electronic dance music genre. By 1981, a new form of dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in dance music nightclubs, radio stations, shows and raves. During its gradual decline in the late 1970s, disco became influenced by computerization (the first notable fully synthesized disco hit was \"I Feel Love\" by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte with lyrics by Donna Summer). Looping, sampling and segueing as found in disco continued to be used as creative techniques within trance music, techno music and especially house music. Electronic dance music experienced a boom after the proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s, manifest in the dance element of Tony Wilson's Haçienda scene (in Manchester) and London clubs like Delirium, The Trip, and Shoom. The ongoing influence of Shoom can be seen in its 25th anniversary party, held at Cable Nightclub on 8 December 2012, which sold out in four days. The scene rapidly expanded to the Summer Of Love in Ibiza, which became the European capital of house and trance. Clubs like Sundissential and Manumission became household names with British, German and Italian tourists. Many music genres that made use of electronic instruments developed into contemporary styles mainly due to the MIDI protocol, which enabled computers, synthesizers, sound cards, samplers, and drum machines to interact with each other and achieve the full synchronization of sounds. Electronic dance music is typically composed using computers and synthesizers, and rarely has any physical instruments. Instead, this is replaced by digital or electronic sounds, with a 4/4 beat. Many producers of this kind of music however, such as Darren Tate and MJ Cole, were trained in classical music before they moved into the electronic medium. Associated with dance music are usually commercial tracks that may not easily be categorized, such as \"The Power\" by Snap!, \"No Limit\" by 2 Unlimited, \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\" by C+C Music Factory, and the Beatmasters' \"Rok Da House\" but the term \"dance music\" is applied to many forms of electronic music, both commercial and non-commercial. Some of the most popular upbeat genres include house, techno, drum & bass, jungle, hardcore, electronica, industrial, breakbeat, trance, psychedelic trance, UK garage and electro. There are also much slower styles, such as downtempo, chillout and nu jazz. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Subgenres of house include acid house, electro house, hard house, funky house, deep house, tribal house, hip house, tech house and US garage. Subgenres of drum & bass include techstep, hardstep, jump-up, intelligent D&B/atmospheric D&B, liquid funk, sambass, drumfunk, neurofunk and ragga jungle. Subgenres of other styles include progressive breaks, booty bass, Goa trance, hard trance, hardstyle, minimal techno, gabber techno, breakcore, broken beat, trip hop, folktronica and glitch. Speed garage, breakstep, 2-step, bassline, grime, UK funky, future garage and the reggae-inspired dubstep are all subgenres of UK garage. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. Nightclubs were frequented by large numbers of people at which a form of jazz, which was characterized by fancy orchestras with strings instruments and complex arrangements, became the standard music at clubs. A particularly popular dance was the fox-trot. At the time this music was simply called jazz, although today people refer to it as \"white jazz\" or big band. \"Genres\": Swing music, Western swing \"Genres\": Rock and roll In 1952, the television show American Bandstand switched to a format where teenagers dance along as records are played. American Bandstand continued to be shown until 1989. In 1960, Chubby Checker released his song \"The Twist\" setting off a dance craze. The late 1960s saw the rise of soul and R&B music which used lavish orchestral arrangements. \"Other genres\": Funk \"Genres\": Disco, funk, R&B, hip hop In 1970, the television show \"Soul Train\" premiered featuring famous soul artists who would play or lipsync their hits while the audience danced along. By the mid-1970s disco had become one of the main genres featured. In 1974, \"Billboard\" added a Disco Action chart of top hits to its other charts (see List of Billboard number one dance club play songs). Disco was characterized by the use of real orchestral instruments, such as strings, which had largely been abandoned during the 1950s because of rock music. In contrast to the 1920s, however, the use of live orchestras in night clubs was extremely rare due to its expense. Disc jockeys (commonly known as DJs) played recorded music at these new clubs. The disco craze reached its peak in the late 1970s when the word \"disco\" became synonymous with \"dance music\" and nightclubs were referred to as \"discos\". \"Genres\": New Wave, Italo disco, Euro disco, post-disco, synthpop, dance-pop, funk, contemporary R&B, hip hop, new jack swing, house, acid house, techno, freestyle, Miami bass, bounce, electro, Hi-NRG, Madchester, EBM, cosmic disco, Balearic beat, New beat \"Genres\": House, Italo dance, Italo house, Eurodance, Europop, progressive house, French house, techno, trance, alternative dance, new jack swing, contemporary R&B, dancehall, hip hop, G-funk, Miami bass, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat, breakbeat hardcore, rave, hardcore, happy hardcore, speed garage, UK garage, soca, reggaeton, psytrance, Goa trance \"Genres\": Trance, electropop, dance-pop, snap, crunk, dancehall, reggaeton, dance-punk, nu-disco, electro house, minimal techno, dubstep, grime, bassline, UK funky, contemporary R&B, hip hop, drum and bass, progressive house, hardstyle, funky house \"Genres\": Electropop, synthpop, glitchpop, hip house, nu-disco, New Wave, new rave, trance, house, Hi-NRG, hard NRG, dance-pop, electroclash, electro-industrial, deep house, drum and bass, dubstep, techstep, liquid funk, electro house, glitch house, progressive house, breakbeat, hardstyle, dubstyle, drumstep, hip hop, ghetto house, Jersey club, trap, drill, moombahton, moombahcore, dancehall, chillwave, vaporwave, tropical house, UK garage, Europop The Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart tracks the most popular tracks played by radio stations using a \"dance music\" format.

{"query": "Li Shidao's cultural impact beyond his rebellion against Tang dynasty instead of military campaigns", "pos": ["Tang dynasty art\nTang dynasty art Tang dynasty art () is Chinese art made during the Tang dynasty (618–907). It is best known for the development of many forms—painting, sculpture, calligraphy, music, dance and literature. The Tang dynasty, with its capital at Chang'an (today's Xi'an), the most populous city in the world at the time, is regarded by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization—equal, or even superior, to the Han period. The Tang period was considered the golden age of literature and art. Stimulated by contact with India and the Middle East, the empire saw a flowering of creativity in many fields. Buddhism, originating in what is modern day India around the time of Confucius, continued to flourish during the Tang period and was adopted by the imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. Block printing made the written word available to vastly greater audiences. Beginning in the Tang dynasty, the primary subject matter of Chinese painting was the landscape, known as \"shanshui\" (mountain-water) painting. In these landscapes, usually monochromatic and sparse, the purpose was not to reproduce exactly the appearance of nature but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere so as to catch the \"rhythm\" of nature. Trading along the Silk Road of various products increased cultural diversity in cosmopolitan Chinese cities, such as Chang'an, had a marked influence on the Chinese arts of the Tang dynasty. Many designs that were enjoyed with the upper classes of imperial China became common even in everyday art. Chinese ceramics saw many significant developments, including the first Chinese porcelain meeting both Western and Chinese definitions of porcelain, in Ding ware and related types. The earthenware Tang dynasty tomb figures are better known in the West today, but were only made to placed in elite tombs close to the capital in the north, between about 680 and 760. They were perhaps the last significant fine earthenwares to be produced in China, many lead-glazed \"sancai\" (three-colour) wares, which was also used for vessels for burial, and perhaps for use; the glaze was less toxic than in the Han, but perhaps still to be avoided for use at the dining table. Others are unpainted or were painted over a slip; the paint has now often fallen off. In the south the wares from the Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site in Tongguan are significant as the first regular use of underglaze painting; examples have been found in many places in the Islamic world. However the production tailed off and underglaze painting remained a minor technique for several centuries. Yue ware was the leading high-fired, lime-glazed celadon of the period, and was of very sophisticated design, patronized by the court. This was also the case with the northern porcelains of kilns in the provinces of Henan and Hebei, which for the first time met the Western as well as the Eastern definition of porcelain, being a pure white and translucent. One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in the \"Chain of Chronicles\" written by the Arab traveler and merchant Suleiman in 851 AD during the Tang dynasty who recorded that:  The Arabs were well used to glass, and he was certain that the porcelain that he saw was not that. Yaozhou ware or Northern Celadon also began under the Tang, though like Ding ware its best period was under the next Song dynasty. The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the qin during the Tang dynasty, though the qin is known to have been played since before the Han dynasty. Late 20th century excavations of an intact tomb of the period revealed not only a number of instruments (including a spectacular concert bell set) but also inscribed tablets with playing instructions and musical scores for ensemble concerts, which are now heard again as played on reproduction instruments at the Hubei Provincial Museum. Chinese opera is generally dated back to the Tang dynasty with Emperor Xuanzong (712–755), who founded the Pear Garden, the first known opera troupe in China. The troupe mostly performed for the emperors' personal pleasure. The poetry of the Tang dynasty is about the most appreciated poetic era of Chinese poetry. The \"shi\", the classical form of poetry which had developed in the late Han dynasty, reached its zenith. During the Tang dynasty, poetry became popular, and writing poetry was considered a sign of learning. One of China's greatest poets was Li Po, who wrote about ordinary people and about nature, which was a powerful force in Chinese art. One of Li Po's short poems, \"Waterfall at Lu-Shan\", shows how Li Po felt about nature."], "neg": ["Yang Shidao\nYang Shidao Yang Shidao (died 647), courtesy name Jingyou, posthumously known as Duke Yi of Ande, was a Chinese official who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong in the Tang dynasty. It is not known when Yang Shidao was born. He was a son of Yang Xiong (楊雄), a distant nephew of Sui Dynasty and one of the four most powerful officials at one point early in Sui, with Gao Jiong, Yu Qingze (虞慶則), and Su Wei and who was created an imperial prince with various titles, eventually the title of Prince of Guan. His older brother Yang Gongren served as an official during both Sui and Tang Dynasty and who briefly served as chancellor during the reign of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu. At the end of Sui Dynasty, when the state was engulfed in uprisings against Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang, Yang Shidao was at the eastern capital Luoyang, and was subsequently detained by the general Wang Shichong, who deposed Sui's final emperor Yang Tong (Emperor Yang's grandson) in 619 and established a new state of Zheng as its emperor, but Yang Shidao was eventually able to go to Chang'an, where another general, Li Yuan had established Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu in 618. (It is not completely clear whether Yang's travel to Chang'an was before or after Zheng's fall to Tang in 621, but likely before.) Late in 621, when Eastern Tujue forces attacked Ling Prefecture (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), Yang Shidao was referred to as the commandant at Ling Prefecture, and he was able to repel the Eastern Tujue attack; he would again be involved in a campaign resisting Eastern Tujue attacks in 622. Yang Shidao's older brother Yang Gongren was an old friend of Emperor Gaozu's, and, at some point, Yang Shidao was made a guard commander for Emperor Gaozu's guards. Emperor Gaozu gave Yang Shidao his daughter Princess Guiyang in marriage. Yang Shidao later served as the deputy minister of civil service affairs, and then the minister of rites. He was also created the Duke of Ande—a title that his father had held at one point. In 624, when the crown prince Li Jiancheng's guard commander Yang Wen'gan (楊文幹) rebelled, Yang Shidao was one of the generals whose forces were involved in defeating Yang Wen'gan. In 636, after Emperor Gaozu had succeeded by his son Li Shimin in 626 (after Li Shimin ambushed and killed Li Jiancheng and another brother Li Yuanji and then effetively forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him), Yang Shidao was made \"Shizhong\" (侍中) – the head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, \"Menxia Sheng\") and a post considered one for a chancellor. He was considered careful in his actions, not leaking any words on the important matters of state. He once said, \"When I was young, I read the \"Book of Han\", and I saw that Kong Guang [(孔光, a prime minister during the reigns of Emperor Cheng of Han and Emperor Ai of Han)] was not even willing to speak about the trees in the greenhouses inside the palace. I admired that, and I want to be like that.\" Whenever he left imperial gatherings, he would invite talented people to meet at his mansion to discuss literature, and the gatherings at his house were considered important literary events. He was also said to be talented at calligraphy. In 639, he became \"Zhongshu Ling\" (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau and also considered a post for a chancellor. In 643, a plot centering the crown prince Li Chengqian was discovered where Li Chengqian considered overthrowing his father. Yang's stepson Zhao Jie (趙節), a son of Princess Guiyang (now titled Princess Changguang) by her deceased husband Zhao Cijing (趙慈景)) was one of the co-conspirators. When Yang was involved in the investigation of the case, he tried to intercede on Zhao Jie's behalf with Emperor Taizong, and this displeased Emperor Taizong. Yang was therefore demoted to the post of minister of civil service affairs, no longer a chancellor. Zhao Jie was executed. (Emperor Taizong later personally visited Princess Changguang to apologize for the fact that he could not spare Zhao Jie, but stated that he did so because he had to be fair in governing the state.) Because Yang was born out of a very honored lineage, he was well-acquainted with the nobles. However, because of this, he did not promote people that he knew well to avoid appearance of conflict of interest. This, in turn, however, brought criticism that he was not in fact being fair, as he was not promoting that he knew to be capable. In 644, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, stated to his key officials their strengths and weaknesses, he spoke, with regard to Yang: In 645, when Emperor Taizong attacked Goguryeo, Yang followed him and was made acting \"Zhongshu Ling\", but was said to perform poorly, and after the end of the campaign, he was demoted to the post of minister of labor, and then minister of rites. He died in 647 and was buried near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, where Emperor Taizong would eventually be buried himself.", "Liang Shidu\nLiang Shidu Liang Shidu (梁師都) (died June 3, 628) was an agrarian leader who rebelled against the rule of the Chinese dynasty Sui Dynasty near the end of the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui. He, claiming the title of Emperor of Liang with the aid from Eastern Turkic Khaganate retained the modern northern Shaanxi and western Inner Mongolia region for over a decade, but was gradually weakened by attacks from Tang Dynasty, whose founding emperor Emperor Gaozu and successor Emperor Taizong had eliminated the rival contenders for power one by one, leaving Liang isolated. In 628, with the Eastern Turks in internal turmoil and unable to come to his aid, Emperor Taizong launched another attack on Liang. Liang's cousin Liang Luoren (梁洛仁) assassinated him and surrendered, completing Tang's drive to reunite China after Sui's collapse. Liang Shidu was from a prominent clan of Xia Province (夏州, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi), and during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, he served as a military officer. In or shortly before 617, he quit the army and returned to his home commandery (as Xia Province had been converted into the Shuofang Commandery). At that time, there were many agrarian rebellions in the region, and Liang gathered a group of men and ambushed the secretary general of Shuofang Commandery, Tang Shizong (唐世宗). He initially claimed the title of grand chancellor (大丞相, \"Da Chengxiang\") and entered into an alliance with Eastern Tujue. When the Sui general Zhang Shilong (張世隆) tried to attack him, he defeated Zhang. He thereafter captured several other nearby commanderies—Diaoyin (雕陰, in modern Yulin as well), Honghua (弘化, roughly modern Qinghua, Gansu), and Yan'an (延安, roughly modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). He submitted to Eastern Tujue's Shibi Khan Ashina Duojishi, who created him the Dadupiqie Khan (大度毗伽可汗) and bestowed on him a flag with a wolf head, the symbol of the Tujue. He guided Eastern Tujue forces to occupy the Ordos Desert region. Subsequently, Ashina Duojishi forged the title of Jieshi Tianzi (解事天子, i.e., \"the \"Tianzi\" who solved issues\") for Liang, although he himself declared a state of Liang and himself its emperor. Liang Shidu entered into an alliance with another rebel leader of the region, Guo Zihe (郭子和). In 618, with the Sui general Li Yuan having rebelled against Emperor Yang and entered the capital Chang'an, declaring Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong), another rebel ruler, Xue Ju the Emperor of Qin, entered into an alliance with Liang and Eastern Tujue, seeking to attack Chang'an. However, Li Yuan was able to persuade the Eastern Tujue general Ashina Duobi (Ashina Duojishi's brother) to give up the campaign. In fall 618, with Li Yuan having had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu, Liang tried to attack Ling Prefecture (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), which had submitted to Tang, but was repelled. In spring 619, Ashina Duojishi was planning on a major incursion into Chinese territory, and both Liang and another rebel ruler, Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, joined him. However, Ashina Duojishi then died at this time, and his brother Ashina Qilifu succeeded him (as Chuluo Khan), and Ashina Qilifu terminated the campaign after receiving a large tribute from Tang. Liang then again attacked Ling Prefecture but was again repelled. In fall 619, he attacked Yan Prefecture (延州, i.e., the former Yan'an Commandery), which had submitted to Tang as well, but was repelled by the Tang general Duan Decao (段德操). Another Liang attack in fall 620, in conjunction with Eastern Tujue, was also repelled by Duan. Meanwhile, Liang's one-time ally Guo Zihe, who had submitted to Tang as well, had turned against Liang and Eastern Tujue, seizing Liang's city of Ningshuo (寧朔, in modern Yulin). (Eastern Tujue, in response, imprisoned Guo's brother Guo Zisheng (郭子升), and Guo subsequently moved south to avoid Eastern Tujue forces.) Meanwhile, with his generals Zhang Ju (張舉) and Liu Min (劉旻) having defected to Tang and with Liu Wuzhou having been defeated by Tang earlier in 620, Liang was fearful that he would become next, and he sent his official Lu Jilan (陸季覽) to point out to Ashina Qilifu that he should act against Tang before it became too strong to control. Ashina Qilifu agreed, and made a grand plan to attack Tang on several sides, incorporating Xi tribe forces and those of another rebel ruler, Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, into the plan. However, before Ashina Qilifu could launch his plan, Ashina Qilifu died. He was succeeded by Ashina Duobi (as Jiali Khan). In spring 622, Duan launched an attack on Liang, capturing the eastern city of Liang's capital Shuofang, forcing Liang to withdraw to the western city. However, relief forces from Eastern Tujue arrived, and Duan withdrew. Liang subsequently sent his brother Liang Luo'er (梁洛兒) to, with Eastern Tujue forces, attack Tang's Ling Prefecture, but was repelled by the Tang general Li Daozong. In spring 623, Liang Shidu's generals He Sui (賀遂) and Suo Tong (索同) defected to Tang, along with the territory they controlled. In summer 623, Duan Decao launched another attack on Liang, reaching Shuofang, but withdrew after pillaging. In response, the Liang general Xin Liao'er (辛獠兒) guided Eastern Tujue troops to attack Tang's Lin Prefecture (林州, roughly modern Qingyang), and then Liang himself guided Eastern Tujue forces to attack Tang's Kuang Prefecture (匡州, also in modern Yulin). In fall 624, the major Liang official Bai Fuyuan (白伏願) defected to Tang. In 626, Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, ambushed and killed his brothers Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). Meanwhile, Liang himself saw his forces weakening, and suggested to Ashina Duobi that he invade Tang. Ashina Duobi and his nephew, the subordinate Tuli Khan Ashina Shibobi (阿史那什鉢苾), jointly attacked the Tang capital Chang'an, but withdrew after Emperor Taizong personally met them and offered additional tributes. After this point, however, Eastern Tujue was itself in internal turmoil and had less ability to aid Liang. Emperor Taizong therefore wrote Liang Shidu several times to try to persuade him to submit, but Liang refused. Emperor Taizong sent raiding forces to pillage Liang periodically, as well as to burn the crops, reducing Liang's food supplies, and also sent agents into Liang territory to damage the relationships between Liang and his officials. In summer 628, when a number of Khitan tribes surrendered to Tang, Ashina Duobi offered to trade Liang for the Khitan tribes, but Emperor Taizong refused. Meanwhile, Emperor Taizong sent his brother-in-law Chai Shao (柴紹) and the generals Xue Wanjun (薛萬均), Liu Lancheng (劉蘭成), and Liu Min (Liang's former subordinate) to pressure Shuofang. They soon defeated Eastern Tujue forces and put Shuofang under siege, and Eastern Tujue forces were unable to lift the siege. When the food supplies ran out, Liang Shidu's cousin Liang Luoren assassinated Liang Shidu and surrendered the city to Tang."]}
{"query": "Enmerkar's reign and achievements outside of the conflict with En-suhgir-ana instead of his disputes with Aratta", "pos": ["Enmerkar\nEnmerkar Enmerkar ( ) is a legendary king listed as the builder of the Sumerian city of Uruk. He was said to have reigned for \"420 years\"; some copies read \"900 years\". The king list adds that Enmerkar became king after his father Mesh-ki-ang-gasher, son of Utu, had \"entered the sea and disappeared.\"  Enmerkar is also known from a few other Sumerian legends, most notably \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\", where a previous confusion of the languages of mankind is mentioned. In this account, it is Enmerkar himself who is called 'the son of Utu' (the Sumerian sun god). Aside from founding Uruk, Enmerkar is said here to have had a temple built at Eridu, and is even credited with the invention of writing on clay tablets, for the purpose of threatening Aratta into submission. Enmerkar furthermore seeks to restore the disrupted linguistic unity of the inhabited regions around Uruk, listed as Shubur, Hamazi, Sumer, Uri-ki (the region around Akkad), and the Martu land.  Three other texts in the same series describe Enmerkar's reign. In \"Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana\", while describing Enmerkar's continued diplomatic rivalries with Aratta, there is an allusion to Hamazi having been vanquished. In \"Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave\", Enmerkar is seen leading a campaign against Aratta. The fourth and last tablet, \"Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird\", describes Enmerkar's year-long siege of Aratta. It also mentions that fifty years into Enmerkar's reign, the Martu people had arisen in all of Sumer and Akkad, necessitating the building of a wall in the desert to protect Uruk. In these last two tablets, the character of Lugalbanda is introduced as one of Enmerkar's war chiefs. According to the Sumerian king list, it was this Lugalbanda \"the shepherd\" who eventually succeeded Enmerkar to the throne of Uruk. Lugalbanda is also named as the father of Gilgamesh, a later king of Uruk, in both Sumerian and Akkadian versions of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". In a legend related by Aelian (ca. AD 200), the king of Babylon, \"Euechoros\" or \"Seuechoros\" (also appearing in many variants as \"Sevekhoros\", earlier \"Sacchoras\", etc.), is said to be the grandfather of Gilgamos, who later becomes king of Babylon (i.e., Gilgamesh of Uruk). Several recent scholars have suggested that this \"Seuechoros\" or \"Euechoros\" is moreover to be identified with Enmerkar of Uruk, as well as the \"Euechous\" named by Berossus as being the first king of Chaldea and Assyria. This last name \"Euechous\" (also appearing as \"Evechius\", and in many other variants) has long been identified with Nimrod. The controversial historian David Rohl has claimed parallels between Enmerkar, builder of Uruk, and Nimrod, ruler of biblical Erech (Uruk), who, according to some extra-biblical legends, was supposedly the architect of the Tower of Babel. One parallel Rohl has noted is between the epithet \"the Hunter\", applied to Nimrod, and the suffix \"-kar\" at the end of Enmerkar's name, which means \"hunter\". Rohl has also argued that Eridu near Ur is the original site of the city of Babel and that the incomplete ziggurat found there is none other than the Biblical tower itself.", "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\nEnmerkar and the Lord of Aratta Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta is a legendary Sumerian account, of preserved, early post-Sumerian copies, composed in the Neo-Sumerian period (ca. 21st century BC). It is one of a series of accounts describing the conflicts between Enmerkar, king of Unug-Kulaba (Uruk), and the unnamed king of Aratta (probably somewhere in modern Iran or Armenia). Because it gives a Sumerian account of the \"confusion of tongues\", and also involves Enmerkar constructing temples at Eridu and Uruk, it has, since the time of Samuel Kramer, been compared with the Tower of Babel narrative in the Book of Genesis. Near the beginning of the account, the following background is provided: \"\"In those days of yore, when the destinies were determined, the great princes allowed Unug Kulaba's \"E-ana\" to lift its head high. Plenty, and carp floods and the rain which brings forth dappled barley were then increased in Unug Kulaba. Before the land of Dilmun yet existed, the \"E-ana\" of Unug Kulaba was well founded.\"\" \"E-ana\" was a temple in Uruk built in honour of the goddess Inanna, the \"lady of all the lands\"–(\"E-ana\" is 'house of An', or 'Temple of An'). Similarly, the lord of Aratta has himself crowned in Inanna's name, but she does not find this as pleasing as her brick temple in Uruk. Enmerkar, thus \"chosen by Inanna in her holy heart from the bright mountain\", then asks Inanna to let him subject Aratta and make the people of Aratta deliver a tribute of precious metals and gemstones, for constructing the lofty \"Abzu\" temple of Enki at Eridu, as well as for embellishing her own \"E-ana\" sanctuary at Uruk. Inanna accordingly advises Enmerkar to dispatch a herald across the mountains of Susin and Anshan to the lord of Aratta, to demand his submission and his tribute. Enmerkar agrees and sends the envoy, along with his specific threats to destroy Aratta and disperse its people, if they do not send him the tribute - \"lest like the devastation which swept destructively, and in whose wake Inanna arose, shrieked and yelled aloud, I too wreak a sweeping devastation there.\" He is furthermore to recite the \"Incantation of Nudimmud\", a hymn imploring Enki to restore (or in some translations, to disrupt) the linguistic unity of the inhabited regions, named as Shubur, Hamazi, Sumer, Uri-ki (the region around Akkad), and the Martu land: \"On that day when there is no snake, when there is no scorpion, when there is no hyena, when there is no lion, when there is neither dog nor wolf, when there is thus neither fear nor trembling, man has no rival! At such a time, may the lands of Shubur and Hamazi, the many-tongued, and Sumer, the great mountain of the me of magnificence, and Akkad, the land possessing all that is befitting, and the Martu land, resting in security — the whole universe, the well-guarded people — may they all address Enlil together in a single language! For at that time, for the ambitious lords, for the ambitious princes, for the ambitious kings, Enki, for the ambitious lords, for the ambitious princes, for the ambitious kings, for the ambitious lords, for the ambitious princes, for the ambitious kings — Enki, the lord of abundance and of steadfast decisions, the wise and knowing lord of the Land, the expert of the gods, chosen for wisdom, the lord of Eridug, shall change the speech in their mouths, as many as he had placed there, and so the speech of mankind is truly one.\" The messenger arrives in Aratta, reciting this message to the king, and asks him for a reply to take to his lord Enmerkar, whom he calls \"the scion of him with the glistening beard, whom his stalwart cow gave birth to in the mountain of the shining \"me\", who was reared on the soil of Aratta, who was given suck at the udder of the good cow, who is suited for office in Kulaba.\" The king of Aratta replies that submission to Uruk is out of the question, because Inanna herself had chosen him to his office and power. But the herald then reveals that Inanna has been installed as queen at \"E-ana\" and has even promised Enmerkar to make Aratta bow to Uruk. Devastated by this news, the lord of Aratta finally gives his response: he is more than prepared for a military contest with Uruk, whom he considers no match for his might; however he will submit, on the sole conditions that Enmerkar send him a vast amount of barley grain, and that Inanna convince him that she has forsaken Aratta and confirm her allegiance to Uruk. The herald returns to Enmerkar bearing this reply, and the next day Enmerkar actually sends the barley to Aratta, along with the herald and another demand to send even more precious stones. The lord of Aratta, in a fit of pride, refuses and instead asks Enmerkar to deliver to him these precious stones himself. Upon hearing this, Enmerkar spends ten years preparing an ornate sceptre, then sends it to Aratta with his messenger. This frightens the lord of Aratta, who now sees that Inanna has indeed forsaken him, but he instead proposes to arrange a one-on-one combat between two champions of the two cities, to determine the outcome of the still-diplomatic conflict with Enmerkar. The king of Uruk responds by accepting this challenge, while increasing his demands for the people of Aratta to make a significant offering for the \"E-ana\" and the \"abzu\", or face destruction and dispersal. To relieve the herald who, beleaguered, can no longer remember all the messages with which he is charged, Enmerkar then resorts to an invention: writing on tablets. The herald again traverses the \"seven mountains\" to Aratta, with the tablets, and when the king of Aratta tries to read the message, Ishkur, the storm-god, causes a great rain to produce wild wheat and chickpeas that are then brought to the king. Seeing this, the king declares that Inanna has not forsaken the primacy of Aratta after all, and summons his champion. The remainder of the text has many lacunae-(line text losses), and the following events are unclear, but the tablet seems to end with Enmerkar triumphant, possibly installed by Inanna on the throne of Aratta, and with the people of Aratta delivering the tribute to \"E-ana\", and providing the materials to build the \"Apsû\". A sequel text, \"Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana\", seems to continue the epic.", "Aratta\nAratta Aratta is a land that appears in Vedas(B.S 2.13.14) and Sumerian myths surrounding Enmerkar and Lugalbanda, two early and possibly mythical kings of Uruk also mentioned on the Sumerian king list. Aratta is described as follows in Sumerian literature: Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta <a href=\"http%3A//etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi%3Ftext%3Dt.1.8.2.3%23\"></a> - The goddess Inanna resides in Aratta, but Enmerkar of Uruk pleases her more than does the lord of Aratta, who is not named in this epic. Enmerkar wants Aratta to submit to Uruk, bring stones down from the mountain, craft gold, silver and lapis lazuli, and send them, along with \"kugmea\" ore to Uruk to build a temple. Inana bids him send a messenger to Aratta, who ascends and descends the \"Zubi\" mountains, and crosses Susa, Anshan, and \"five, six, seven\" mountains before approaching Aratta. Aratta in turn wants grain in exchange. However Inana transfers her allegiance to Uruk, and the grain gains the favor of Aratta's people for Uruk, so the lord of Aratta challenges Enmerkar to send a champion to fight his champion. Then the god Ishkur makes Aratta's crops grow. Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana <a href=\"http%3A//etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi%3Ftext%3Dt.1.8.2.4%23\"></a> - The lord of Aratta, who is here named \"En-suhgir-ana\" (or \"Ensuhkeshdanna\"), challenges Enmerkar of Uruk to submit to him over the affections of Inanna, but he is rebuffed by Enmerkar. A sorcerer from the recently defeated Hamazi then arrives in Aratta, and offers to make Uruk submit. The sorcerer travels to Eresh where he bewitches Enmerkar's livestock, but a wise woman outperforms his magic and casts him into the Euphrates; En-suhgir-ana then admits the loss of Inanna, and submits his kingdom to Uruk. Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave <a href=\"http%3A//etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi%3Ftext%3Dt.1.8.2.1%23\"></a> - is a tale of Lugalbanda, who will become Enmerkar's successor. Enmerkar's army travels through mountainous territory to wage war against rebellious Aratta. Lugalbanda falls ill and is left in a cave, but he prays to the various gods, recovers, and must find his way out of the mountains. Lugalbanda and the Anzud Bird <a href=\"http%3A//etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi%3Ftext%3Dt.1.8.2.2%23\"></a> - Lugalbanda befriends the \"Anzud\" bird, and asks it to help him find his army again. When Enmerkar's army is faced with setback, Lugalbanda volunteers to return to Uruk to ask the goddess Inana's aid. He crosses through the mountains, into the flat land, from the edge to the top of Anshan and then to Uruk, where Inana helps him. She advises Enmerkar to carry off Aratta's \"worked metal and metalsmiths and worked stone and stonemasons\" and all the \"moulds of Aratta will be his\". Then the city is described as having battlements made of green lapis lazuli and bricks made of \"tinstone dug out in the mountains where the cypress grows\".  Early 20th century scholars initially took \"Aratta\" to be an epithet of the Sumerian city Shuruppak related to its local name for the god Enlil; however that is no longer seen to be the case. Although Aratta is known only from myth, some Assyriologists and archaeologists have speculated on possible locations where Aratta could have been, using criteria from the myths:  In 1963, Samuel Noah Kramer thought that a \"Mount Hurum\" in a Lugalbanda myth (which he titled \"Lugalbanda on Mount Hurrum\" at the time) might have referred to the Hurrians, and hence speculated Aratta to be near Lake Urmia. However, \"Mount Hurum\", \"\"hur-ru-um kur-ra-ka\"\", in what is now called \"Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave\",<a href=\"http%3A//etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi%3Ftext%3Dt.1.8.2.1%23\"></a> is today read \"mountain cave\", and Kramer subsequently introduced the title \"Lugalbanda, the Wandering Hero\" for this story. Other speculations referred to the early gem trade route, the \"Great Khorasan Road\" from the Himalayan Mountains to Mesopotamia, which ran through northern Iran. Anshan, which had not yet been located then, was assumed to be in the central Zagros mountain range. However, when Anshan was identified as Tall-i Malyan in 1973, it was found to be 600 km south-east of Uruk, far removed from any northerly routes or watercourses from Uruk, and posing the logistical improbability of getting a 27th-century BC Sumerian army through 550 km of Elamite territory to wage war with Aratta. Nevertheless, there have been speculations referring to eastern Iran as well. Dr. Yousef Majidzadeh believes the Jiroft Civilization could be Aratta. By 1973, archaeologists were noting that there was no archaeological record of Aratta's existence outside of myth, and in 1978 Hansman cautions against over-speculation. Writers in other fields have continued to hypothesize Aratta locations. A \"possible reflex\" has been suggested in Sanskrit \"Āraṭṭa\" or \"Arāṭṭa\" mentioned in the Mahabharata and other texts;  Alternatively, the name is compared with the toponym Ararat or Urartu."], "neg": ["Enmebaragesi\nEnmebaragesi Enmebaragesi (cuneiform: , fl. c. 2500 BC) was a king of Kish, according to the Sumerian king list. The list states that he subdued Elam, reigned 900 years, and was captured single-handedly by Dumuzid \"the fisherman\" of Kuara, predecessor of Gilgamesh. He is the earliest ruler on the king list whose name is attested directly from archaeology. Two alabaster vase fragments inscribed with his name were found at Nippur where, according to the Sumerian \"Tummal Inscription\", he is said to have built the first temple. There are in all at least four surviving fragments bearing the abbreviated form \"Mebarag(e)si\", describing him as the \"lugal\" of Kish. He is also mentioned in a section of the original Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", \"Bilgamesh and Aga\", as the father of the Aga who laid siege to Uruk. The Sumerian king list and the \"Tummal Inscription\" concur with the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" in making him the father of Aga, who was the final king of the 1st dynasty of Kish. Thus the fragments verifying Enmebaragesi's historicity enhance the notion that Gilgamesh is also historical. The later Sumerian Renaissance (Ur III) king Shulgi addressed one of his praise poems to Gilgamesh, that credits Gilgamesh with capturing and defeating Enmebaragesi — thus contradicting the king list, where he was already captured by Gilgamesh's predecessor. In another part of the Gilgamesh epic, Gilgamesh offers his \"sister\" Enmebaragesi to be the wife of the monster Huwawa or Humbaba, causing some debate as to Enmebaragesi's gender, with most scholars taking this reference as a jest.  In the 2009 comedy film \"Year One\", a film parodying historical, biblical and mythical persons, places and events, Enmebaragesi is portrayed as one of the best hunters from the village."]}

According to the 1988 film \"Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic\", Haynes could dribble the ball as many as 348 times a minute. As a child, Haynes learned to dribble a basketball in the dirt yard of his home. A native of Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he attended Booker T. Washington High School and received a $25 church scholarship to play basketball for Langston University, where he attended from 1942 to 1946. During his time with the Langston Lions, the team racked up a winning record of 112–3, including a 59-game winning streak.  In a February 1945 conference tournament game, Haynes showed off his dribbling skills for more than two minutes, running down the clock on a solid lead to ridicule an opponent, Southern University, which had run up the score against an inferior team (Sam Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University, coached by a young Jackie Robinson) in a previous round. Haynes' own coach, the legendary Zip Gayles, threatened to kick him off the team for his showboating display, but it got an immense response from the crowd at the game. In 1946, Langston was invited to play an exhibition game against the Globetrotters in Oklahoma City. In that game, Haynes led Langston to a 4-point win, catching the eye of team owner Abe Saperstein in the process. He was invited to join the Globetrotters, and, after completing his degree, began his long professional career. Haynes played with the Globetrotters from 1947 to 1953. One of the exhibition games in which he played was the famous game in West Berlin on August 22, 1951, where a landmark 75,000 people were recorded in attendance—although Haynes later insisted the turnout was closer to 90,000—and Haynes met track star Jesse Owens, with whom he roomed on the tour. He also toured South America with the Globetrotters and played a series of exhibition games against some of the top college basketball teams in the United States. In 1953, Haynes left the Globetrotters after an acrimonious split with Abe Saperstein, the team's owner. After quitting the team, he turned down a $35,000 a year offer from the Philadelphia Warriors that would have made him the second-highest paid player in the NBA to found his own barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians, after finding out that Saperstein was a part-owner of the Warriors. He also received an offer to play for the Minneapolis Lakers in 1955, but he turned down that opportunity as well. Despite a series of legal battles with Saperstein, Haynes attended his funeral in 1966, although he later joked he was only there to \"make sure he didn't jump out of the casket\". Haynes later rejoined the Globetrotters as a player and coach in 1972. During his second stint with the team, he founded a clothing company in 1973, through which he met his wife Joan, a model. He was a regular on the 1974–75 \"The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine\" TV show. After leaving the Globetrotters again in 1979, he played for Meadowlark Lemon's Bucketeers, the Harlem Wizards, and a revitalized incarnation of his old Harlem Magicians. By the end of his playing career, Haynes was estimated to have played in at least 12,000 games and visited more than 100 countries. Haynes retired in 1992 after a 46-year professional career, and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998, the first Globetrotter to be so honored. On January 5, 2001, he received his \"Legends\" ring from the Harlem Globetrotters in Chicago. The Globetrotters also retired his #20 jersey in his honor. Haynes spent his twilight years in Plano, Texas, where he and his wife moved in the mid-1990s to be closer to their daughters. His old team, the Globetrotters, \"pulled strings\" to get him a ticket to the 2010 NBA All-Star Game in Arlington, Texas. In 2011, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. That year, he also joined the staff of the Texas Legends, a farm team for the Dallas Mavericks. At the time, he told the press that, even at the age of 85, \"Basketball is constantly on my mind.\" Haynes died at the age of 89 on May 22, 2015, in Plano, Texas. His death was stated to be of natural causes. Haynes was considered to be among the greatest ballhandlers who ever lived. Wilt Chamberlain once said, \"What he did was something that I could never do, and I could do almost everything on the basketball court.\" His game influenced players such as Bob Cousy, Pete Maravich, and Fred \"Curly\" Neal. He has been described as one of the best basketball players never to compete in the NBA.

{"query": "Adamsia palliata reproduction and life cycle instead of symbiotic relationship with Pagurus prideaux", "pos": ["Adamsia palliata\nAdamsia palliata Adamsia palliata is a species of sea anemone in the family Hormathiidae. It is usually found growing on a gastropod shell inhabited by the hermit crab, \"Pagurus prideaux\". The anemone often completely envelops the shell and because of this it is commonly known as the cloak anemone or the hermit-crab anemone. In a revision of British Anthozoa in 1981, Manuel applied the name \"Adamsia carciniopados\" to this species, attributing it to Otto, 1823. However Cornelius and Ates in 2003 decided that \"Adamsia palliata\" was the valid name, attributing it to O.F. Muller, 1776. \"A. palliata\" normally lives on the shell of a sea snail which is housing a hermit crab. The anemone's base is wide and convoluted with lobes that extend around the shell. The edges join together in a suture where the shell is completely encircled. The oral disc and tentacles are orientated downwards beneath the underside of the crab. The basal lobes can extend to about fifteen centimetres while the trunk is only about one centimetre high. The column is fawn tinged with pinkish-purple, paling to white near the parapet. It is covered with vivid magenta spots which are largest in the central portion. There is a narrow pink line round the margin of the parapet and the oral disc and tentacles are white. The tentacles are numerous and about one centimetre long, not fully retractable and arranged in four sub-marginal rows. The mouth is long and oval and protrudes from the disc. When it becomes too large for the shell, the anemone secretes a chitinous membrane at its base. This has the effect of increasing the volume of the shell available to the hermit crab which can then inhabit it for a longer period before needing to find a new home. In one instance, on a shell of \"Gibbula umbilicalis\", this membrane had developed into a pseudo body-whorl as voluminous as the rest of the shell. On the lower part of the column there are specialist cells which emit defensive pink (occasionally white) threads called acontia if the animal is disturbed. \"A. palliata\" is found in shallow parts of the northeast Atlantic Ocean south to the Azores, in the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs wherever its hermit crab host is found, in deep water on sandy flats and particularly favours muddy gravelly bottoms with shell fragments. Off the coast of Norway it was said to be common at a depth of 15 to 20 fathoms (30 to 40 metres) in 1860. \"A. palliata\" breeds during the summer months. Several hundred globular golden eggs are ejected into the water column through the mouth and are fertilised externally. Each develops into a planula larva which settles and develops into a juvenile sea anemone. The larva is for some reason drawn to settle on the inner lip of a gastropod shell. At first the larva develops in the same way as a typical sea anemone, but as it grows, its base extends around the gastropod shell until the two lobes meet at the upper side of the lip. The species of shell the anemone chooses varies, and has included \"Buccinum undatum\", \"Scaphander lignarius\", and various Trochidae. It has even been found on a shell of the garden snail \"Helix aspersa\" which had been accidentally washed out to sea.  The shell always seem to be tenanted by the hermit crab \"Pagurus prideaux\". Occasionally this anemone is found on empty shells, but this may be explained by the fact that the crab will readily abandon its current shell if it finds a larger or better one to move into. Young specimens of the anemone are able to detach themselves from their shell and re-attach themselves elsewhere, such as another shell, a \"Laminaria\" frond or the side of an aquarium. The symbiosis between \"A. palliata\" and \"P. prideaux\" is beneficial to both. The anemone gains a mobile base and access to food scraps while the crab gains the protection against predators provided by the anemone's nematocysts. It is not an obligate symbiosis however. The anemone has been kept in an aquarium for an extended period on a rock substrate and in 1969, Maynardi and Rossi found a single example of the hermit crab \"Pagurus excavatus\" carrying, on its gastropod shell, a specimen of \"A. palliata\" and another of \"Calliactis parasitica\"."], "neg": ["Sexual reproduction\nSexual reproduction Sexual reproduction is a kind of life cycle where generations alternate between cells with a single set of chromosomes (haploid) and cells with a double set of chromosomes (diploid). \"Sexual reproduction\" is by far the most common life cycle in eukaryotes, for example animals and plants.  Diploid cells divide into haploid cells in a process called meiosis. Two haploid cells combine into one diploid cell in a process called fertilisation. Between fertilisation and meiosis there can be a large number of cell divisions without change of the number of chromosomes.  Fertilization creates a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Meiosis in the parents' gonads produce gamete cells which only contain 23 chromosomes each. When the gametes are combined via sexual intercourse to form a fertilized egg, the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 chromosome pairs or 46 total. Cell division mitosis then initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle because asexual reproduction should be able to outcompete it as every young organism created can bear its own young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation. This 50% cost is a fitness disadvantage of sexual reproduction. The two-fold cost of sex includes this cost and the fact that any organism can only pass on 50% of its own genes to its offspring. One definite advantage of sexual reproduction is that it prevents the accumulation of genetic mutations. Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection in which some individuals out-reproduce others of a population because they are better at securing mates for sexual reproduction. It has been described as \"a powerful evolutionary force that does not exist in asexual populations.\" Prokaryotes, whose initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material, reproduce through asexual reproduction but may, in lateral gene transfer, display processes such as bacterial conjugation, transformation and transduction, which are similar to sexual reproduction although they do not lead to reproduction. The first fossilized evidence of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is from the Stenian period, about 1 to 1.2 billion years ago. Biologists studying evolution propose several explanations for why sexual reproduction developed and why it is maintained. These reasons include reducing the likelihood of the accumulation of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of adaptation to changing environments, dealing with competition, and masking deleterious mutations. All of these ideas about why sexual reproduction has been maintained are generally supported, but ultimately the size of the population determines if sexual reproduction is entirely beneficial. Larger populations appear to respond more quickly to benefits obtained through sexual reproduction than do smaller population sizes. Maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained by theories that work at several levels of selection, though some of these models remain controversial. However, newer models presented in recent years suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly reproducing complex organisms. Sexual reproduction allows these species to exhibit characteristics that depend on the specific environment that they inhabit, and the particular survival strategies that they employ. In order to sexually reproduce, both males and females need to find a mate. Generally in animals mate choice is made by females while males compete to be chosen. This can lead organisms to extreme efforts in order to reproduce, such as combat and display, or produce extreme features caused by a positive feedback known as a Fisherian runaway. Thus sexual reproduction, as a form of natural selection, has an effect on evolution. Sexual dimorphism is where the basic phenotypic traits vary between males and females of the same species. Dimorphism is found in both sex organs and in secondary sex characteristics, body size, physical strength and morphology, biological ornamentation, behavior and other bodily traits. However, sexual selection is only implied over an extended period of time leading to sexual dimorphism. Apart from some eusocial wasps, organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 sex ratio of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as Fisher's principle. This essentially says the following: Insect species make up more than two-thirds of all extant animal species. Most insect species reproduce sexually, though some species are facultatively parthenogenetic. Many insects species have sexual dimorphism, while in others the sexes look nearly identical. Typically they have two sexes with males producing spermatozoa and females ova. The ova develop into eggs that have a covering called the chorion, which forms before internal fertilization. Insects have very diverse mating and reproductive strategies most often resulting in the male depositing spermatophore within the female, which she stores until she is ready for egg fertilization. After fertilization, and the formation of a zygote, and varying degrees of development, in many species the eggs are deposited outside the female; while in others, they develop further within the female and are born live. There are three extant kinds of mammals: monotremes, placentals and marsupials, all with internal fertilization. In placental mammals, offspring are born as juveniles: complete animals with the sex organs present although not reproductively functional. After several months or years, depending on the species, the sex organs develop further to maturity and the animal becomes sexually mature. Most female mammals are only fertile during certain periods during their estrous cycle, at which point they are ready to mate. Individual male and female mammals meet and carry out copulation. For most mammals, males and females exchange sexual partners throughout their adult lives. The vast majority of fish species lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male, some species lay their eggs on a substrate like a rock or on plants, while others scatter their eggs and the eggs are fertilized as they drift or sink in the water column. Some fish species use internal fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or give birth to live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the guppy and mollies or \"Poecilia\". Fishes that give birth to live young can be ovoviviparous, where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in seahorses, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young. Fishes can also be viviparous, where the female supplies nourishment to the internally growing offspring. Some fish are hermaphrodites, where a single fish is both male and female and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species. One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; \"Poecilia formosa\" is a unisex species that uses a form of parthenogenesis called gynogenesis, where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring. \"Poecilia formosa\" mate with males of other fish species that use internal fertilization, the sperm does not fertilize the eggs but stimulates the growth of the eggs which develops into embryos. Animals typically produce gametes directly by meiosis. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes are called eggs or ova. In animals, fertilization follows immediately after meiosis. Plants on the other hand have mitosis occurring in spores, which are produced by meiosis. The spores germinate into the gametophyte phase. The gametophytes of different groups of plants vary in size; angiosperms have as few as three cells in pollen, and mosses and other so called primitive plants may have several million cells. Plants have an alternation of generations where the sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores within the sporangium by meiosis. Flowering plants are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce either sexually or asexually. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers. The anther produces pollen grains which contain the male gametophytes (sperm). For pollination to occur, pollen grains must attach to the stigma of the female reproductive structure (carpel), where the female gametophytes (ovules) are located inside the ovary. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the sex cell nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and endosperm nuclei within the female gametophyte in a process termed double fertilization. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus two female cells) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a fruit, which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either self-pollinate or cross-pollinate. Nonflowering plants like ferns, moss and liverworts use other means of sexual reproduction. In 2013, flowers dating from the Cretaceous (100 million years before present) were found encased in amber, the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma. The pollen was sticky, suggesting it was carried by insects. Ferns mostly produce large diploid sporophytes with rhizomes, roots and leaves; and on fertile leaves called sporangium, spores are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or thallus, produce both motile sperm in the antheridia and egg cells in separate archegonia. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the archegonia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. A zygote is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporephyte and gametophyte plants is called alternation of generations. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the \"Psilotum\", \"Lycopodium\", \"Selaginella\" and \"Equisetum\". The bryophytes, which include liverworts, hornworts and mosses, reproduce both sexually and vegetatively. They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with flagella and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that photosynthesize. Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antherida respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing a zygote. The zygote divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid. The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules, which are connected by seta to the archegonia. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, when ripe the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. Also in some species each plant is one sex while other species produce both sexes on the same plant. Fungi are classified by the methods of sexual reproduction they employ. The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of resting spores that are used to survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: plasmogamy, karyogamy and meiosis. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during plasmogamy and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores. Three distinct processes in prokaryotes are regarded as similar to eukaryotic sex: bacterial transformation, which involves the incorporation of foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome; bacterial conjugation, which is a transfer of plasmid DNA between bacteria, but the plasmids are rarely incorporated into the bacterial chromosome; and gene transfer and genetic exchange in archaea. Bacterial transformation involves the recombination of genetic material and its function is mainly associated with DNA repair. Bacterial transformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. This process occurs naturally in at least 40 bacterial species. For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state referred to as competence (see Natural competence). Sexual reproduction in early single-celled eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation, or from a similar process in archaea (see below). On the other hand, bacterial conjugation is a type of direct transfer of DNA between two bacteria through an external appendage called the conjugation pilus. Bacterial conjugation is controlled by plasmid genes that are adapted for spreading copies of the plasmid between bacteria. The infrequent integration of a plasmid into a host bacterial chromosome, and the subsequent transfer of a part of the host chromosome to another cell do not appear to be bacterial adaptations. Exposure of hyperthermophilic archaeal Sulfolobus species to DNA damaging conditions induces cellular aggregation accompanied by high frequency genetic marker exchange. Ajon et al. hypothesized that this cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA repair by homologous recombination. DNA transfer in Sulfolobus may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that also involve species-specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage."]}
{"query": "Chelsea neighborhood history and cultural attractions instead of its administrative boundaries in Manhattan", "pos": ["Chelsea (name)\nChelsea (name) Chelsea was first a place name of Old English origin, and the most common theory of its meaning is \"chalk landing place\", \"Cealc-hyð\" = \"chalk wharf\".  The Synod of Chelsea at \"Chelchith\" in 787 is often identified with Chelsea, London; but the first firm record is of a manor at Chelsea just before the Norman conquest. Today this original Chelsea is part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and is pronounced . From this origin other usages and places have arisen. For example, Chelsea, Manhattan, takes its name from a Federal-style house in the area which had been named after the manor of Chelsea, London. The female name Chelsea is a 20th-century coinage and is also pronounced , or , and sometimes spelled Chelsie or Chelsey. In the United States, the spelling \"Chelsea\" first entered the Social Security Administration baby naming data chart in 1969 at position 708. It rose in popularity among names for girls after 1980, peaking in 1992 at #15. As of 2009 it was ranked #231. This name is possibly linked with British pop culture of the late 1960s and Joni Mitchell's song \"Chelsea Morning\" (named after the Manhattan district). For example, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former U.S. president Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is named after the song as performed by Judy Collins."], "neg": ["Chelsea, London\nChelsea, London Chelsea is an affluent area of South West London, bounded to the south by the River Thames. Its frontage runs from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment, Cheyne Walk, Lots Road and Chelsea Harbour. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the River Westbourne, which is now in a pipe above Sloane Square Underground station. The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is considered that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea.  The district is entirely within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, although Chelsea gives its name to nearby locations, such as Chelsea Harbour located within the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and Chelsea Barracks in the City of Westminster. From 1900, and until the creation of Greater London in 1965, it formed the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in the County of London. The exclusivity of Chelsea as a result of its high property prices has historically resulted in the term Sloane Ranger being used to describe its residents. Since 2011, Channel 4 has broadcast a reality television show called \"Made in Chelsea\", documenting the lives of affluent young people living there. Moreover, Chelsea is home to one of the largest communities of Americans living outside the United States, with 6.53% of Chelsea residents being born in the U.S. The word \"Chelsea\" (also formerly \"Chelceth\", \"Chelchith\", or \"Chelsey\",) originates from the Old English term for \"landing place [on the river] for chalk or limestone\" (\"Cealc-hyð\": chalk-wharf, in Anglo-Saxon). Chelsea hosted the Synod of Chelsea in 787 AD. The first record of the Manor of Chelsea precedes the Domesday Book and records the fact that Thurstan, governor of the King's Palace during the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), gave the land to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster. Abbot Gervace subsequently assigned the manor to his mother, and it passed into private ownership. By 1086 the Domesday Book records that Chelsea was in the hundred of Ossulstone in Middlesex, with Edward of Salisbury as tenant-in-chief. King Henry VIII acquired the manor of Chelsea from Lord Sandys in 1536; Chelsea Manor Street is still extant. Two of King Henry's wives, Catherine Parr and Anne of Cleves, lived in the Manor House; Princess Elizabeth – the future Queen Elizabeth I – resided there; and Thomas More lived more or less next door at Beaufort House. In 1609 James I established a theological college, \"King James's College at Chelsey\" on the site of the future Chelsea Royal Hospital, which Charles II founded in 1682. By 1694, Chelsea – always a popular location for the wealthy, and once described as \"a village of palaces\" – had a population of 3,000. Even so, Chelsea remained rural and served London to the east as a market garden, a trade that continued until the 19th-century development boom which caused the final absorption of the district into the metropolis. The street crossing that was known as Little Chelsea, Park Walk, linked Fulham Road to King's Road and continued to the Thames and local ferry down Lover's Lane, renamed \"Milmans Street\" in the 18th century. King's Road, named for Charles II, recalls the King's private road from St James's Palace to Fulham, which was maintained until the reign of George IV. One of the more important buildings in King's Road, the former Chelsea Town Hall, popularly known as \"Chelsea Old Town hall\" – a fine neo-classical building – contains important frescoes. Part of the building contains the Chelsea Public Library. Almost opposite stands the former Odeon Cinema, now Habitat, with its iconic façade which carries high upon it a large sculptured medallion of the now almost-forgotten William Friese-Greene, who claimed to have invented celluloid film and cameras in the 1880s before any subsequent patents. According to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", \"the better residential portion of Chelsea is the eastern, near Sloane Street and along the river; the western, extending north to Fulham Road, is mainly a poor quarter\". This is no longer the case, although housing trusts and Council property do remain. The areas to the west also attract very high prices. This former fashionable village was absorbed into London during the eighteenth century. Many notable people of 18th century London, such as the bookseller Andrew Millar, were both married and buried in the district. The memorials in the churchyard of Chelsea Old Church, near the river, illustrate much of the history of Chelsea. These include Lord and Lady Dacre (1594/1595); Lady Jane Cheyne (1698); Francis Thomas, \"director of the china porcelain manufactory\"; Sir Hans Sloane (1753); Thomas Shadwell, Poet Laureate (1692). The intended tomb Sir Thomas More erected for himself and his wives can also be found there, though More is not in fact buried here. In 1718, the Raw Silk Company was established in Chelsea Park, with mulberry trees and a hothouse for raising silkworms. At its height in 1723, it supplied silk to Caroline of Ansbach, then Princess of Wales. Chelsea once had a reputation for the manufacture of Chelsea buns, made from a long strip of sweet dough tightly coiled, with currants trapped between the layers, and topped with sugar. The Chelsea Bun House sold these during the 18th century and was patronised by the Georgian royalty. At Easter, great crowds would assemble on the open spaces of the Five Fields – subsequently developed as Belgravia. The Bun House would then do a great trade in hot cross buns and sold about quarter of a million on its final Good Friday in 1839. The area was also famous for its \"Chelsea China\" ware, though the works, the Chelsea porcelain factory – thought to be the first workshop to make porcelain in England – were sold in 1769, and moved to Derby. Examples of the original Chelsea ware fetch high values. The best-known building is Chelsea Royal Hospital for old soldiers, set up by Charles II (supposedly on the suggestion of Nell Gwynne), and opened in 1694. The beautifully proportioned building by Christopher Wren stands in extensive grounds, where the Chelsea Flower show is held annually. The former Duke of York's Barracks (built 1801-3) off King's Road is now part of Duke of York Square, a redevelopment including shops and cafes and the site of a weekly \"farmers' market\". The Saatchi Gallery opened in the main building in 2008. Chelsea Barracks, at the end of Lower Sloane Street, was also in use until recently, primarily by ceremonial troops of the Household Division. Situated on the Westminster side of Chelsea Bridge Road, it was bought for re-development by a property group from Qatar. Chelsea's modern reputation as a centre of innovation and influence originated in a period during the 19th century, when the area became a Victorian artists' colony (\"see Borough of artists below\"). It became prominent once again as one of the centres of the \"Swinging London\" of the 1960s, when house prices were lower than in the staid Royal Borough of Kensington. Chelsea once had a reputation as London's bohemian quarter, the haunt of artists, radicals, painters and poets. Little of this seems to survive now – the comfortable squares off King's Road are homes to, amongst others, investment bankers and film stars. The Chelsea Arts Club continues \"in situ\"; however, the Chelsea College of Art and Design, founded in 1895 as the Chelsea School of Art, moved from Manresa Road to Pimlico in 2005. Its reputation stems from a period in the 19th century when it became a sort of Victorian artists' colony: painters such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, J. M. W. Turner, James McNeill Whistler, William Holman Hunt, and John Singer Sargent all lived and worked here. There was a particularly large concentration of artists in the area around Cheyne Walk and Cheyne Row, where the Pre-Raphaelite movement had its heart. The artist Prunella Clough was born in Chelsea in 1919. The architect John Samuel Phene lived at No. 2 Upper Cheyne Row between 1903 and his death in 1912. He installed numerous artefacts and objets d'art around the house and gardens and it was known locally as the \"Gingerbread Castle\". It was demolished in 1924. Chelsea was also home to writers such as George Meredith, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Leigh Hunt and Thomas Carlyle. Jonathan Swift lived in Church Lane, Richard Steele and Tobias Smollett in Monmouth House. Carlyle lived for 47 years at No. 5 (now 24) Cheyne Row. After his death, the house was bought and turned into a shrine and literary museum by the Carlyle Memorial Trust, a group formed by Leslie Stephen, father of Virginia Woolf. Virginia Woolf set her 1919 novel \"Night and Day\" in Chelsea, where Mrs. Hilbery has a Cheyne Walk home. In a book, \"Bohemia in London\" by Arthur Ransome which is a partly fictional account of his early years in London, published in 1907 when he was 23, there are some fascinating, rather over-romanticised accounts of bohemian goings-on in the quarter. The American artist Pamela Colman Smith, the designer of A. E. Waite's Tarot card pack and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, features as \"Gypsy\" in the chapter \"A Chelsea Evening\". A central part of Chelsea's artistic and cultural life was Chelsea Public Library, originally situated in Manresa Road. Its longest serving member of staff was Armitage Denton, who joined in 1896 at the age of 22, and he remained there until his retirement in 1939; he was appointed Chief Librarian in 1929. In 1980, the building was purchased by Chelsea College of Art and Design. The Chelsea Collection is a priceless anthology of prints and pictures of old Chelsea. Begun in 1887, it contains works by artists as notable and diverse as Rossetti and Whistler. During his time at the Library, Armitage Denton built the Collection assiduously, so that by the time of his death in July 1949 it numbered more than 1,000 items. At the end of the 20th century, the Collection totalled more than 5,000 works, and it continues to grow. The Chelsea Society, formed in 1927, remains an active amenity society concerned with preserving and advising on changes in Chelsea's built environment. Chelsea Village and Chelsea Harbour are new developments outside of Chelsea itself. Chelsea shone again, brightly but briefly, in the 1960s Swinging London period and the early 1970s. The Swinging Sixties was defined on King's Road, which runs the length of the area. The Western end of Chelsea featured boutiques Granny Takes a Trip and The Sweet Shop, the latter of which sold medieval silk velvet caftans, tabards and floor cushions, with many of the cultural cognoscenti of the time being customers, including Keith Richards, Twiggy, and many others. The \"Chelsea girl\" was symbol of, John Crosby wrote, what \"men [found] utterly captivating\", with a \"'life is fabulous' philosophy\". Chelsea at this time was home to the Beatles and to Rolling Stones members Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Keith Richards. In the 1970s, the World's End area of King's Road was home to Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's boutique \"SEX\", and saw the birth of the British punk movement. By the late 1970s, the growing bohemian and punk population moved from Chelsea into nearby Notting Hill and further north to Camden Town, with the rapid gentrification of the two areas, both of which remain places with a significant population of artists, musicians and those who work in other creative industries, particularly Camden Town. King's Road remains the major artery through Chelsea and a busy road, and despite its continuing reputation as a shopping mecca, is now home to many of the same shops found on other British high streets, such as Gap, and McDonald's. Sloane Street is quickly catching up with Bond Street as one of London's premier shopping destinations, housing a variety of high-end fashion or jewellery boutiques such as Cartier, Tiffany & Co, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Gucci, Harrods, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Valentino, Bvlgari, Gianni Versace and Graff. On 27 November 1974, the London unit of the Provisional Irish Republican Army exploded twin bombs on Tite Street, injuring 20 people. In the 18th century, Chelsea Cricket Club was prominent for a time and played its home matches on what was then Chelsea Common, an area that virtually disappeared under building work in the 19th century. Records have survived of five important matches between 1731 and 1789 which involved the Chelsea club and/or were played on the common. Chelsea Football Club is located at Stamford Bridge in neighbouring Fulham, close to the border with Chelsea. As a result of Chelsea's expensive location and wealthy residents, Chelsea F.C. has the wealthiest local supporters in England. The club is owned by Russian billionaire and Chelsea resident, Roman Abramovich. Chelsea consists of two main postcodes (SW3 and SW10) but also includes small sections of SW1. All of Chelsea is, by definition, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC). On the eastern side RBKC meets the borough of the City of Westminster (COW), this meets at Chelsea Bridge Road where the postcode is SW1W, with one side of the road being in COW and the other in RBKC. The vast majority of Chelsea lies in the prestigious SW3 postcode. The far west of Chelsea is SW10 and SW5 but due to the absence of tube coverage in large parts of the Borough, most people in SW10 use Earls Court or Fulham Broadway tube stations. The most desirable part of Chelsea is around Sloane Square and Knightsbridge tube. Around here, Chelsea meets Knightsbridge. This property market attracts considerable (international) attention, and is a very complex market as it consists mainly of short leases under Earl Cadogan as freeholder. Much of Chelsea is now viewed as a \"\"Global Ultra Prime Residential Area\"\". Much of Chelsea (SW3) and Knightsbridge (SW1X) is still owned by Earl Cadogan, through the Cadogan Estates. Most of the property owned is in and around Cadogan Square. This has a major influence on the markets as the Earl is the freeholder and generally has no desire to sell; although changes in legislation now mean the freeholder is obliged to sell lease extensions to a leaseholder at prices which are determined by the Leasehold valuation tribunal. Lord Cadogan is generally regarded as an effective and successful property developer/landlord being responsible, together with his management team, for bringing all of the fashion labels to Sloane Street, and also forward thinking developments on his own account at Duke of York Square on Kings Road, at Peter Jones and on Sloane Street. The Cadogan Estate has a considerable portfolio of retail property throughout Chelsea but notably on Fulham Road, Kings Road, and Sloane Street including Peter Jones, Harvey Nichols, and 12 hotels including the Cadogan Hotel. The Estate maintains many of the garden squares, (to which local residents can gain access by subscribing for an annual fee – and optionally the tennis courts where applicable). The area is home to several open spaces including Albert Bridge Gardens, Battersea Bridge Gardens, Chelsea Embankment Gardens, Royal Hospital Chelsea: the grounds of which are used by the annual Chelsea Flower Show and Chelsea Physic Garden. London Buses serving Chelsea are: Chelsea town centre does not currently have its own Underground station, although two stations close to the area are Sloane Square (District and Circle lines) on the northeastern edge of the district and South Kensington (District, Circle and Piccadilly lines). Imperial Wharf railway station at Chelsea Harbour on the West London Line, which is on the southwestern edge of Chelsea. London Overground and Southern trains stop here. A Chelsea railway station (later renamed \"Chelsea and Fulham\") previously existed on this line, located between the King's Road and the Fulham Road in neighbouring Fulham, but this was closed in 1940 following World War II bomb damage and later demolished. There is a proposal to construct a Chelsea Underground station on the King's Road as part of the Crossrail 2 project (also known as the \"Chelsea-Hackney line\"). The project, run by Transport for London, has not yet been approved or funded but is at the consultation stage. According to plans published by TfL in 2008, it is envisaged that the station would be located on the Dovehouse Green area of King's Road.", "Chelsea, Staten Island\nChelsea, Staten Island Chelsea is a small neighborhood located on the West Shore of Staten Island in New York City. It is bordered on the north by South Avenue, on the east by the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge, on the south by Meredith Avenue, and on the west by the Arthur Kill. The area was originally named Pralltown after a family that was granted land there in 1675. During the Revolutionary period it was called Peanutville due to the storage there of quantities of peanuts for the passengers using the ferries to travel between New York and New Brunswick. In the 1950s, there were plans for Consolidated Edison to build a massive electric plant on of land that it owned in Chelsea.  Chelsea is mostly open marsh and is relatively undeveloped, although there are some businesses and one-family houses. It borders on the Teleport and is the site of Staten Island's West Shore Plaza and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Meredith Avenue bus depot. Chelsea is served by the local buses and the express bus."]}
{"query": "Gaelic League social impact instead of political activities", "pos": ["Gaelic revival\nGaelic revival The Gaelic revival () was the late-nineteenth-century national revival of interest in the Irish language (also known as \"Gaelic\") and Irish Gaelic culture (including folklore, sports, music, arts, etc.). Irish had diminished as a spoken tongue, remaining the main daily language only in isolated rural areas, with English having become the dominant language in the majority of Ireland. Interest in Gaelic culture was evident in the beginning of the nineteenth century with the formation of the Ulster Gaelic Society in 1830, and later in the scholarly works of John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, and the foundation of the Ossianic Society. Concern for spoken Irish led to the formation of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language in 1876, and the Gaelic Union in 1880. The latter produced the \"Gaelic Journal\". Irish sports were fostered by the Gaelic Athletics Association, founded in 1884. The Gaelic League () was established in 1893 by Eoin MacNeill and other enthusiasts of Gaelic language and culture. Its first president was Douglas Hyde. The objective of the League was to encourage the use of Irish in everyday life in order to counter the ongoing anglicisation of the country. It organised weekly gatherings to discuss Irish culture, hosted conversation meetings, edited and periodically published a newspaper named , and successfully campaigned to have Irish included in the school curriculum. The League grew quickly, having more than 400 branches within four years of its foundation. It had fraught relationships with other cultural movements of the time, such as the Pan-Celtic movement and the Irish Literary Revival. Important writers of the Gaelic revival include , Patrick Pearse () and . Early pioneers of Irish scholarship were John O'Donovan, Eugene O'Curry and George Petrie; O'Donovan and O'Curry found an outlet for their work in the Archaeological Society, founded in 1840. From 1853, translations of Irish literary works, particularly mythological works of the Ossianic Cycle—associated with the Fianna—were published by the Ossianic Society, in which Standish Hayes O'Grady was active. The Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language was formed in 1877 by, among others, George Sigerson and Thomas O'Neill Russell. The secretary of that society, Father John Nolan, split with it in 1880 and formed the Gaelic Union, of which the president was The O'Conor Don, and whose members included Douglas Hyde and Michael Cusack. Cusack's interest in Gaelic culture was not restricted to the language; he took a keen interest in the traditional games of Ireland, and in 1884, with Maurice Davin, he would found the Gaelic Athletic Association to promote the games of Gaelic football, hurling and handball. In 1882 the Gaelic Union began publication of a monthly journal, the \"Gaelic Journal\". Its first editor was David Comyn; he was followed by John Fleming, a prominent Irish scholar, and then Father Eugene O'Growney. In November 1892 Douglas Hyde gave a lecture to the National Literary Society entitled \"The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland.\" He said that the Irish people had become almost completely anglicised, and that this could only be reversed through building up the language. Eoin MacNeill followed this up with an article in the \"Gaelic Journal\", \"A Plea and a Plan for the Extension of the Movement to Preserve and Spread the Gaelic language in Ireland\", and set about forming an organisation to help bring this about, together with Eugene O'Growney and J. H. Lloyd (). The Gaelic League () was founded on 31 July 1893. Hyde was elected president, MacNeill secretary, and Lloyd treasurer, and Thomas O'Neill Russell was among those elected to the council.  The Gaelic League held weekly meetings that were a combination of classes and conversation. Its focus on the vernacular form of language and modern literature distinguished it from the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language, The Celtic Society and the Gaelic Union. Within months it had branches in Cork and Galway. After four years it had 43 branches, and after ten years more than 400. Although it was more concerned with fostering the language in the home than with teaching it in schools, it was nonetheless successful in having Irish added to the curriculum; the number of schools teaching it rose from about a dozen in the 1880s to 1,300 in 1903. The League took over the \"Gaelic Journal\" in 1894, when O'Growney retired as editor, with MacNeill replacing him. In January 1898 it began publication of a weekly newspaper, . In March of the following year, following a dispute with the owner, this was replaced by , with MacNeill again as editor. In 1901 MacNeill was replaced as editor by Eoghan Ó Neachtain, who was in turn replaced in 1903 by Patrick Pearse. The League also concerned itself with the folk music of Ireland, and was involved in the movement which led to the organisation of the Feis Ceoil (Festival of Music) by Annie Patterson in 1897. The League's relations with contemporary cultural movements were strained, and sometimes hostile, despite the fact that some of the League's leaders were on friendly terms with those movements. Pan-Celticism was viewed with suspicion by many members because its leaders in Ireland, especially Lord Castletown, were closely associated with the Irish establishment. When Douglas Hyde was invited to the planned Pan-Celtic Congress of 1900—to be held in Dublin—as a delegate of the League, the (executive committee) refused to send any representative, though Hyde might attend as an individual if he wished. Hyde reluctantly declined to attend. The Irish Literary Revival was denounced because its works were written in English, not Irish, and therefore tended even more towards anglicisation. Eoin MacNeill wrote, \"Let them write for the 'English-speaking world' or the 'English-speaking race' if they will. But let them not vex our ears by calling their writings Irish and national.\" Patrick Pearse said of the Irish Literary Theatre, recently founded by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, that it should be \"strangled at birth\".  (Father Peter O'Leary), a parish priest from Castlelyons in County Cork, began contributing to the \"Gaelic Journal\" in 1894, and in November of that year he published the first instalment of , which was to become his best-known work. It was described by the journal as a \"specimen of Munster Irish, one of the best samples, if not the very best, of southern popular Gaelic that has ever been printed.\" was the first major work of modern literature in Irish. serialised the in the \"Cork Weekly Examiner\" in 1900–1901, and followed it up with a series of modern renderings of ancient Irish tales such as , , and , all of which eschewed scholarship in favour of colloquial, entertaining Irish. After , his best-known work is his autobiography, . All his works are written in what was called (the language of the people). Patrick Pearse (), the editor of —and later a revolutionary leader in the Easter Rising—wrote poetry, short stories and plays. He is considered the first modernist writer in Irish. Pearse rejected what he called the imposition of \"dead linguistic and literary forms on a living language\", but at the same time rejected the idea that only native speakers like could produce \"Irish Irish\". He produced two books of short stories, (1907) and (1916). His collection of poems, (1914) contains his most famous poem, \"\" (\"I am Ireland\").", "Conradh na Gaeilge\nConradh na Gaeilge Conradh na Gaeilge (; historically known in English as the Gaelic League) is a social and cultural organisation which promotes the Irish language in Ireland and worldwide. The organisation was founded in 1893 with Douglas Hyde as its first president, when it emerged as the successor of several 19th century groups such as the Gaelic Union. The organisation would be the spearhead of the Gaelic revival and \"Gaeilgeoir\" activism. Originally the organisation intended to be apolitical, but many of its participants became involved in Irish nationalism. Bruce Stewart suggests that an address by Douglas Hyde \"led to the formation of the Gaelic League\" with Hyde as the president. The address titled ‘The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland’ was delivered by Hyde to the Irish National Literary Society, on 25 November 1892. (Thereafter, it was published in \"The Revival of Irish Literature\", 1894.) Conradh na Gaeilge was founded in Dublin on 31 July 1893 by Douglas Hyde, the son of a Church of Ireland rector from Frenchpark, County Roscommon with the aid of Eugene O'Growney, Eoin MacNeill, Thomas O'Neill Russell and others. The organisation developed from Ulick Bourke's earlier Gaelic Union and became the leading institution promoting the Gaelic Revival, carrying on efforts like the publishing of the Gaelic Journal. The League's first newspaper was An Claidheamh Soluis (The Sword of Light) and its most noted editor was Pádraig Pearse. The motto of the League was Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin amháin (Ourselves, Ourselves alone). The League encouraged female participation from the start and a number of women played a prominent role. They were not restricted to subordinate roles, but played an active part in leadership, although males were in the overwhelming majority. Local notables, such as Lady Gregory in Galway, Lady Esmonde in County Wexford, and Mary Spring Rice in County Limerick, and others such as Norma Borthwick, founded and led branches in their communities. At the annual national convention in 1906 women were elected to seven of the forty-five positions on the Gaelic League executive. Executive members included Máire Ní Chinnéide, Úna Ní Fhaircheallaigh (who wrote pamphlets on behalf of the League), Bean an Doc Uí Choisdealbha, Máire Ní hAodáin, Máire de Buitléir, Nellie O'Brien, Eibhlín Ní Dhonnabháin and Eibhlín Nic Néill. Though apolitical, the organisation attracted many Irish nationalists of different persuasions, much like the Gaelic Athletic Association. It was through the League that many future political leaders and rebels first met, laying the foundation for groups such as the Irish Volunteers (1913). However, Conradh na Gaeilge did not commit itself entirely to the national movement until 1915, whereupon Douglas Hyde resigned as president, feeling that the culture of language should be above politics. Most of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation were members. It still continued to attract many Irish Republicans. Seán MacStiofáin, the first chief of staff of the Provisional IRA was a prominent member in his later life. After the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the organisation had a less prominent role in public life as Irish was made a compulsory subject in state-funded schools. It did unexpectedly badly in the Irish Seanad election, 1925, when all the candidates it endorsed were defeated, including Hyde. In 1927, An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha (CLRG) was founded as a subcommittee of the League to investigate the promotion of traditional Irish dance. Eventually, CLRG became a largely independent organisation, though it is required by its constitution to share 3 board members with the League. Conradh na Gaeilge, in alliance with other groups such as Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta, was instrumental in the community campaigns which led to the creation of RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta (1972), Údarás na Gaeltachta (1980), and TG4 (1996). The organisation successfully campaigned for the enactment of the Official Languages Act, 2003 which gave greater statutory protection to Irish speakers and created the position of \"An Coimisinéir Teanga\" (The Languages Commissioner). Conradh na Gaeilge was among the principal organisations responsible for co-ordinating the successful campaign to make Irish an official language of the European Union. In 2008 during the presidency of Dáithí Mac Cárthaigh, Conradh na Gaeilge adopted a new constitution reverting to its pre 1915 non-political stance restating its aim as that of an Irish-speaking Ireland \"Is í aidhm na hEagraíochta an Ghaeilge a athréimniú mar ghnáththeanga na hÉireann\" and dropping any reference to Irish freedom. In recent years Conradh na Gaeilge has remained central to campaigns to protect language rights throughout Ireland. This strategy encompasses the promotion of increased investment in Gaeltacht areas, advocacy for increased provision of state services through Irish, the development of Irish language hubs in urban areas, and the Acht Anois campaign for the enactment of legislation to protect the Irish language in Northern Ireland. The organisation has branches in several parts of Ireland and overseas and is closely involved in the development of the Seachtain na Gaeilge promotional campaign. Conradh na Gaeilge has recently opened free legal advice centres (\"Ionaid Saor-Chomhairle Dlí\") in Dublin and Galway in partnership with Free Legal Advice Centres. The Gaelic League publishes a magazine called \"Feasta\", founded in 1948.

Barbee played college basketball for Massachusetts under John Calipari, winning two Atlantic 10 regular season and tournament championships in 1992 and 1993. Barbee was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and grew up as a fan of the nearby Butler University Bulldogs. Butler recruited him to play for the team, but Barbee chose to play for Massachusetts instead. In his four years as a Minuteman, Barbee averaged double-figures in scoring every year. He finished with 1,643 career points. The Atlantic 10 named him to the league Freshman Team in 1989–90, and the Second Team in 1990–91 and 1992–93. The Minutemen compiled a 91–39 () overall record during Barbee's four years, and advanced to two NITs and two NCAA Tournaments. He graduated in 1993 with a degree in Sports Management. After UMass, Barbee played professional basketball in Spain and France. For the 1995–96 season, Barbee returned to college basketball as a graduate assistant at UMass, helping as the Minutemen reached the Final Four for the first time in program history. After Calipari moved to the NBA and Bruiser Flint was promoted to head coach, Barbee was also promoted to assistant coach, where he would work with the Minutemen for two additional seasons. Barbee spent the 1998–99 season as an assistant coach with Wyoming. He then returned to UMass for one more season, and then moved to Calipari's staff again, this time at Memphis, starting in the 2000–01 season, where he would establish a reputation as an excellent recruiter. Barbee spent six years with the Tigers, as the team compiled a 148–59 () record. Barbee Reunited with Coach Calipari for the 2014-2015 season. This time at the University of Kentucky where he served as the Special Assistant to the Head Coach, in this role Barbee assisted in a multitude of roles, including game-plan preparation and practice plans. With Barbee’s help the Wildcats enjoyed one of the most storied seasons in program history, becoming the first team in NCAA history to begin a season 38-0 while claiming the SEC regular-season and tournament crowns, advancing to the program’s fourth Final Four in Five seasons, and helping six players go in the NBA Draft. Barbee was hired as the coach of the Miners on August 14, 2006, succeeding Doc Sadler, who moved to coach Nebraska. Barbee was the first African-American head coach in UTEP men's basketball history. This was another milestone for the program, as their 1966 team, then known as Texas Western, became the first team with five African-American starters to win a title game, defeating Kentucky and their all-white team. Barbee spent four seasons in El Paso, and the Miners improved steadily each year. The 2009–10 season was the highlight during Barbee's tenure. The Miners made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five seasons. Their regular season conference title was the first since the 2003–04 season, when UTEP was a member of the WAC. Barbee was named the C-USA Coach of the Year, as well as the NABC District 11 Coach of the Year. The Miners went 82–52 () under Barbee's leadership.

Barbee became the first black head men's or women's basketball coach at Auburn. Tony Barbee lost his first game as Auburn's head coach on November 12, 2010 to UNC Asheville in overtime 70–69. This was also the first men's basketball game played in Auburn Arena. Barbee did not get his first win at Auburn until the 4th game of his first season, beating Middle Tennessee 68–66. However, after this rough start, Barbee's first Auburn team managed to remain competitive in the SEC, so much so that his former coach John Calipari went as far as to say that Barbee should be considered for SEC Coach of the Year. Despite showing promise at the end of his first season, Barbee never had a winning season at Auburn. His best record came in the 2011–12 season when Auburn finished 15–16. Auburn then lost 16 of 17 SEC games during a stretch of the 2012–13 season under Barbee, and had yet another losing season in 2013–14. The Barbee era at Auburn was fraught with off the court issues. Following the 2011–12 season, Auburn point guard Varez Ward was arrested on charges of point shaving. This case was later dismissed when Ward went into a pre-trial diversion program and with full cooperation with the FBI, neither Auburn nor Ward were found guilty of any wrongdoing. Of the 21 players that Barbee signed while at Auburn, only 9 remained on his roster in his 4th season due to player dismissals and transfers. Barbee was fired on March 12, 2014, minutes after losing in the first round of the SEC Tournament to South Carolina 74–56.

He was born at Newtown, County Offaly, the son of William Smith (died 1747) and his wife Hester Lynch of Galway. The Smith family had come to Ireland from Yorkshire in the seventeenth century, and acquired substantial property in the Irish Midlands. Michael revered the memory of his father, who died when his son was only seven, and later composed a eulogy which was inscribed on his father's tombstone. He graduated from the University of Dublin, and was called to the Bar in 1769. He was elected member of the Irish House of Commons for Randalstown in 1783, and was noted for his eloquence in debate. He was raised to the Bench as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1793; in 1801 he became Master of the Rolls in Ireland, retiring in 1806. The Mastership of the Rolls had long been notorious as a sinecure for politicians, many of whom had no legal qualifications whatever, and some of whom were Englishmen rarely visited Ireland. The appointment of Smith, a lawyer of undoubted ability, is thought to have been the result of a conscious policy of making the Mastership a full-time and responsible judicial office; the policy was largely successful. His first marriage to Maryanne Cusack, daughter and heiress of James Cusack of Ballyronan, County Wicklow, was an interesting one for an ambitious young lawyer as Maryanne was an open and devout Roman Catholic. They had two children, William and Angelina. Their son Sir William Cusack-Smith, 2nd Baronet followed his father into the law and as a Baron of the Exchequer. His appointment caused some disquiet, both because he was only 35 years old, and because he was already showing marked signs of eccentricity. William's second son Thomas Berry Cusack Smith continued the family traditions of judicial eminence and eccentricity: like his grandfather he was Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and like his father he was notably eccentric. William's sister Angelina married twice but had no issue. Maryanne died in 1798. Michael remarried his cousin Eleanor, daughter of another Michael Smith; in 1799 he was made a baronet of Tuam in King's County. By his second marriage he had one son, Michael, born posthumously. According to Elrington Ball he was noted for learning and eloquence; in contrast to his son and grandson, who were both notably hot-tempered, he was invariably calm and self-controlled. Daniel O'Connell, then a rising young barrister, who thought poorly of Irish judges in general, complained of Smith's inefficiency, yet praised him as \"a gentleman and a scholar, polite, patient and attentive\". While his first marriage to a Roman Catholic suggests that hewas personal tolerant of the practice of Catholicism, one of his best-known judgments, \"Butler v.

{"query": "AVCIS relationship to other police intelligence organizations globally instead of UK focus", "pos": ["Association of Chief Police Officers\nAssociation of Chief Police Officers The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), officially The Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was a not-for-profit private limited company that for many years led the development of policing practices in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Established in 1948, ACPO provided a forum for chief police officers to share ideas and coordinate their strategic operational responses, and advised government in matters such as terrorist attacks and civil emergencies. ACPO coordinated national police operations, major investigations, cross-border policing, and joint law enforcement. ACPO designated Senior Investigative Officers for major investigations and appointed officers to head ACPO units specialising in various areas of policing and crime reduction. ACPO was led by Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde, QPM, who was, until 2009, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He was elected as president by fellow members of ACPO in April 2009. ACPO was funded by Home Office grants, profits from commercial activities and contributions from the 44 police authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Following the Parker Review into ACPO, it was replaced in 2015 by a new body, the National Police Chiefs' Council, set up under a police collaboration agreement under Section 22A of the Police Act 1996. UK policing sprang from local communities in the 1800s. Since the origins of policing, chief officers have regularly associated to discuss and share policing issues. Although ACPO as now recognised was formed in 1948, records of prior bodies go back to the early 1900s. The UK retains a decentralised model of policing based around the settlement which emerged from the Royal Commission on the work of the Police in 1962. ACPO continued to provide a forum for chief officers across 44 local police forces and 13 national areas across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and provided local forces with agreed national policies and guidelines. ACPO failed to convince its sponsors to contribute to its survival and in May 2011 the BBC reported that ACPO would run out of money in February 2012 without extra funding. ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 police authorities. A third of police authorities refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The Association of Police Authorities said the withdrawal of funding by police authorities was \"partly due to a squeeze on their income\". ACPO was due to wind up formally in April 2015. Over time, demands for coordination across the police service increased as society changed, for example to take account of new developments in international terrorism and organised crime, or roles such as monitoring offenders on release from prison or working with young people to divert them from crime. In 1997 ACPO was incorporated as a private company limited by guarantee. As a private company, ACPO was not subject to freedom of information legislation. It was not a staff association; the staff association for senior police officers was a separate body, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA). The change in structure from a \"band of volunteers\" to a limited company allowed the organisation to employ staff, enter into contracts for accommodation and publish accounts. A number of options were considered for the status of ACPO, including charitable status, but all were discounted. Chief Constables and Commissioners are responsible for the direction and control of policing in their force areas. Although a national body and recognized by the government for consultation, ACPO had no powers of its own, nor any mandate to instruct chief officers. However, the organisation allowed chief officers to form a national policy rather than replicate the work in each of their forces. For example, after the 1980–81 riots in 27 British cities including in St. Pauls and Brixton ACPO began to prepare the Public Order Manual of Tactical Operations and Related Matters. Police forces began training in its tactics late in 1983. ACPO was not a staff association. It acted for the police service, not its members. The separate Chief Police Officers Staff Association acts for chief officers. ACPO was composed of the chief police officers of the 44 police forces in England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the Deputy Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constable of 42 of those forces and the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Assistant Commissioner and Commanders of the remaining two - the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. Certain senior non-police staff and senior members of national police agencies and certain other specialised and non-geographical forces in the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were also members. As of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO. The membership elected a full-time President, who held the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002. ACPO was responsible for several ancillary bodies, which it either funded or which received Home Office funding but which reported to ACPO: The ACPO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) was set up in 2006 in response to a perceived gap in the police service's ability to manage criminal records and in particular to improve links to biometric data. The aim of ACRO was to provide operational support relating to criminal records and associated biometric data, including DNA and fingerprint recognition. It also issued police certificates, for a fee, needed to obtain immigration visas for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. The Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), later the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NAVCIS), was managed by ACPO, and was responsible for combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime. The National Community Tension Team (NCTT) was an ACPO body which monitored religious, racial, or other tensions within communities, and provided liaison between police forces and community organisations. The National Counter Terrorism Security Office was funded by, and reported to, ACPO and advised the British government on its counter terrorism strategy. ACPO was responsible for coordinating the national mobilisation of police resources at times of national need through the Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre (PNICC), which it set up in 2003. This included ensuring policing resilience during major events such as emergency response to serious flooding or the investigation of a terrorist attack. PNICC sat alongside the government in COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room) to advise on national issues. PNICC also handled support to overseas crises involving UK nationals. It employed three full-time staff, with other staff seconded to it as needed and is funded by contributions from each of the police forces. The Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) was set up in 2010 by ACPO (and run by the Metropolitan Police) to remove unlawful terrorist material content from the Internet with a focus on UK based material. The December 2013 report of the Prime Minister's Extremism task force said that it would \"work with internet companies to restrict access to terrorist material online which is hosted overseas but illegal under UK law\" and \"work with the internet industry to help them in their continuing efforts to identify extremist content to include in family-friendly filters\" which would likely involve lobbying ISPs to add the CTIRU list to their filters without the need for additional legislation. The National Wildlife Crime Unit is a national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies. ACPO had been criticised as being unaccountable to Parliament or the public by virtue of its limited company status. In October 2009 Sir Hugh Orde stated that ACPO would be \"more than happy\" to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On 30 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice announced that ACPO would be included under the FOI Act from October 2011. In its response, the organisation stated that \"Although organisations cannot voluntarily comply with the Act, a large proportion of ACPO's work is public already or available under FOI through any police force\". In January 2011 its website still said it: \"is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act. The organisation is too small and there are too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and to compile the responses\". From November 2011, however, FOI requests could be made to ACPO. In February 2009, the \"Mail on Sunday\" highlighted the involvement of ACPO in setting up the \"Confidential Intelligence Unit\" as a specialised unit to monitor left-wing and right-wing political groups throughout the UK. The February 2009 \"Mail on Sunday\" investigation also highlighted other activities of the ACPO including selling information from the Police National Computer for £70 despite it costing them only 60p to access it, marketing \"police approval\" logos to firms selling anti-theft devices and operating a separate private firm offering training to speed camera operators. The organisation was criticised in February 2010 for allegedly spending £1.6 million per year from government anti-terrorist funding grants on renting up to 80 apartments in the centre of London which were reported as being empty most of the time. The organisation responded that it had reviewed this policy and would reduce the number of apartments. As a result of \"The Guardian\" articles with regards to the activities and accusations of PC Mark Kennedy of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit within the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit, and the collapse of the subsequent trial of six activists, a number of initiatives and changes were announced: ACPO has supervised the creation of one of the world's largest per-capita DNA databases, containing the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people. ACPO's guidelines that these profiles should only be deleted in \"exceptional circumstances\" were found to be unlawful by the UK Supreme Court in May 2011. They were found to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, following the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in \"S and Marper v United Kingdom\". On 1 May 2012, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 completed its passage through Parliament and received Royal Assent. To date, ACPO has not reissued revised guidelines to replace its unlawful DNA exceptional procedure. Big Brother Watch, in a report of June 2012, concludes that despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in England and Wales remains an uncertain and illiberal regime. During the summer of 2011, Hugh Orde, then president of the ACPO, was seen wearing a dark blue police-style uniform with ACPO insignia, and was accused of wearing a fake uniform. Senior police officers claimed that the uniform was not that of any police force in the country but \"closely resembled\" the uniform worn by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Paul Stephenson. Sam Leith, an author, journalist and literary editor of \"The Spectator\", mocked Orde's decision \"to wear this Gadaffi-style pretend uniform on television\", and suggested it was \"a subliminal pitch for the Met Commissioner's job.\" Brian Paddick, at the time the Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, said: \"It's unusual for the president of ACPO to appear in all these interviews in uniform. He is sending a clear signal: how would I look in the commissioner's uniform?\" One officer noted: \"If anything, Hugh should be wearing the uniform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland because that's where he served. But their uniform is green, not the dark blue he currently wears.\" An ACPO spokesperson stated that the \"Police Reform Act 2002 states that the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers holds the rank of chief constable. Not being a member of a particular force, the President wears a generic police uniform\". In 2013, an independent review of ACPO by General Sir Nick Parker was published. It recommended that ACPO be replaced by a new body, in the interests of greater transparency and cost effectiveness. On the basis of these recommendations, a new organization, the National Police Chiefs' Council, was set up to replace ACPO, which it did on 1 April 2015."], "neg": ["ASIS International\nASIS International ASIS International, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, is a professional organization for security professionals.

Shin was an attorney and takeover businessman of M&A, and is a Korean American. As a child, he had emigrated from South Korea to the United States. He was first ordered by Kim Bok-man as an agent to infiltrate as a double agent and buy over the shares of Seoul Hotel. A shareholder of Hankang distributuon, Kim had warned his old friend Choi that he wanted to swallow up Seoul Hotel, which resulted in a heart attack that killed Choi. Shin was subsequently ordered by Kim from Las Vegas to do the necessary to buy over Seoul Hotel, and at the same time he rented a motel room in the very hotel that he wanted to infiltrate. While in America, Shin first met and picked up Jin Hyung who flagged down his Limousine, after being marooned in the desert when she had a tiff with Tae Jun. After much deliberation, Shin decided to take up Kim's offer and returned to Korea along with his personal assistant Leo, also a Korean American.

The work is famous for Heidegger's powerful reinterpretation of Greek thought, but has been widely regarded as fascist in character. According to Heidegger, the fundamental question of metaphysics is \"why are there beings at all instead of nothing?\" From this fundamental question Heidegger extracts a prior question about the relation to Being; or \"How does it stand with Being?\" This is to be answered through an analysis of Greek poetry, the etymology of the word being and of the answers given by philosophers such as Parmenides, Heraclitus, Aristotle, and Immanuel Kant. To Heidegger, this question is not purely an academic endeavour, for metaphysics grounds an age, by giving \"that age the basis upon which it is essentially formed\". The question thus inherently implicates the totality of human Dasein, and is asked so as to \"restore the historical Dasein of human beings ... back to the power of Being that is to be opened up originally\". This opens up the discussion of socio-political entanglements of Dasein and Heidegger's notion of the \"inner truth and greatness\" of National Socialism. \"Introduction to Metaphysics\" is famous for Heidegger's powerful reinterpretation of Greek thought and infamous for his acknowledgement of the Nazi Party. Julian Young writes that it is a work which even those sympathetic to Heidegger have generally considered fascist in character. Nevertheless, the work has also been seen as being critical of Nazism for being insufficiently radical and suffering from the same spiritual impoverishment as the Soviet Union and the United States. \"Introduction to Metaphysics\" was reviewed by the psychologist and philosopher Miles Groth in \"The Review of Metaphysics\". Groth believed that the translation by Gregory Fried and Richard Polt would be \"more congenial\" to students of twentieth-century continental philosophy than the earlier English translation, but maintained that there were still important problems in Fried and Polt's attempt to make Heidegger's thought accessible. He wrote that their translation \"falters with peculiar renderings of several Heidegger's basic words in this text\", considering their rendering of \"Sein\" as \"Being\" the most important example, and argued that there was no reason to leave \"Dasein\" untranslated, and criticized the omission of Petra Jaeger's afterword to the German edition, along with her detailed table of contents and related texts provided for the 1983 German edition. He described \"Heidegger's readings of Heraclitus and Parmenides\" as \"famously idiosyncratic\", and his \"suggestion that they fundamentally agree\" as \"challenging\".", "Contributions to Philosophy\nContributions to Philosophy Contributions to Philosophy ()) is a work by German philosopher Martin Heidegger. It was first translated into English by Parvis Emad and Kenneth Maly and published by Indiana University Press in 1999 as \"Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)\". In 2012, a new translation was done by Richard Rojcewicz and Daniela Vallega-Neu and published by Indiana University Press as \"Contributions to Philosophy (Of the Event)\". Composed privately between 1936 and 1938, but not available to the public until it was published in Germany in 1989, the work is thought to reflect \"the turn\" (\"die Kehre\") in Heidegger's thought after \"Being and Time\" (1927). In \"Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)\", Heidegger builds on the notions of earth and world, which he had previously introduced in \"The Origin of the Work of Art\", and introduces the concept of \"the last god\". The result is a move away from the centrality of the phenomenological analyses of \"Dasein\", toward the grounding of \"Dasein\" as a historical decision of human beings. Earth can be understood as the condition of possibilities for the world; neither earth nor world can exist without the other, and are thus engaged in a constant and productive struggle or strife. This struggle exists in the crossing from the \"first beginning\" of Western thought, which began with the ancient Greeks and determined the entire history of metaphysics, to the \"other beginning\", which will move beyond metaphysics by properly and originally posing the question of the truth of being (\"Sein\"). In a parallel fashion, human beings counter god(s), and a space between these four points is opened up for the moment of \"enowning\", which grounds the \"essential sway\" of being. The up-welling of the present comes from the future before itself. This means that the being in the now changes the being of the future and thus our utilization of our being in the past. The \"Preview\" to \"Contributions\" lays out provisionally the unfolding of the work and the methodology, here centered on grounding \"the essential swaying of be-ing\" rather than on the existential analytic of \"Dasein\" put forward in \"Being and Time\". The work is organized into six \"joinings\", which reflect the crossing to the new or other beginning, and are each equally original in the shift from man as \"animal rationale\" to man as Dasein, and from the shift from thinking as representation to inceptual, or be-ing-historical, thinking:", "The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy\nThe Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy: Phenomenology for the Godforsaken is a 2006 book by Sean J. McGrath, in which the author critiques secularization through examining the relationship between Martin Heidegger's thought and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity. Struck by the analogies between the thought of the early Heidegger and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity, McGrath discovered that the similarities were far from accidental. Through careful archival work in Germany, McGrath argued (with Max Scheler and Jacques Derrida), that Heidegger, an ex-seminarian and formerly devout Catholic, had secularized Christian concepts in \"Being and Time\".  Heidegger’s book went on to become a foundational text in 20th century atheist thought, and yet none of its major themes would be possible, according to McGrath, without Christianity. The book has been reviewed by Philipp Rosemann, James D. Reid, Christian Lotz and Michael L. Raposa. On the strength of this work, the Centre for Theology and Philosophy at the University of Nottingham, the theological think-tank headed by the Anglican theologian John Milbank, commissioned McGrath to write a short critique of Heidegger for theologians."], "neg": ["Political theology\nPolitical theology Political theology investigates the ways in which theological concepts or ways of thinking relate to politics, society, and economics. It has often been affiliated with Christianity, but since the 21st century, it has more recently been discussed with relation to other religions. The term \"political theology\" is often used to denote religious thought about political principled questions. Scholars such as Carl Schmitt use it to denote religious concepts that were secularized and thus became key political concepts. Another term which often occupies similar space in academic discourse is \"public theology\". It is said that political theology is directed more towards the government or the state, whereas public theology is more towards civil society. The term \"political theology\" has been used in a wide variety of ways by writers exploring different aspects of believers' relationship with politics. It has been used to discuss Augustine of Hippo's \"City of God\" and Thomas Aquinas's \"Summa Theologica\". It has likewise been used to describe the Eastern Orthodox view of \"symphonia\" and the works of the Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin. Though the political aspects of Christianity, Islam, Confucianism, and other traditions has been debated for millennia, political theology has been an academic discipline since the 20th century. The recent use of the term is often associated with the work of Carl Schmitt. Writing amidst the turbulence of the German Weimar Republic, Schmitt argued in his essay \"Politische Theologie\" (1922) that the main concepts of modern politics were secularized versions of older theological concepts. Mikhail Bakunin had used the term in his 1871 text \"The Political Theology of Mazzini and the International\" to which Schmitt's book was a response. Drawing on Thomas Hobbes in \"Leviathan\" he argued that the state exists to maintain its own integrity in order to ensure order in society in times of crisis. Some have divided the approach of political theology between a rightist traditional concern with individual \"moral reform\" (such as Clyde Wilcox's \"God's Warriors\" [1992] and Ted Jelen's \"The Political World of the Clergy\" [1993]) and a leftist focus on collective \"social justice\" (such as Jeffrey K. Hadden's \"The Gathering Storm in the Churches\" [1969] and Harold Quinley's \"The Prophetic Clergy\" [1974]). Kwok Pui-lan has argued that, while Schmitt may have come up with the term and its modern usage, political theologies were likewise forming along very different trajectories elsewhere around the world, such as in Asia. In China in the 1930s, for instance, the Protestant Wu Yaozong advocated that a social revolution was necessary to save both China and the world. This would likewise be true of the role of Protestants involved in Korean nationalism in the early twentieth century. Many major non-Christian philosophers have written extensively on the topic of political theology during recent years, such as Jürgen Habermas, Giorgio Agamben, Simon Critchley, and Slavoj Zizek. Since the early 21st century, there has also been a growing discourse around Islamic political theology, especially within Western contexts that were previously dominated by Christianity. Political theology in China includes responses from Chinese government leaders, scholars, and religious leaders who deal with the relationship between religion and politics. For two millennia, this was organized based on a Confucian understanding of religion and politics, often discussed in terms of Confucian political philosophy. At various points throughout its history, Chinese Buddhism presented an alternative to the political import of Confucianism. However, since the mid-twentieth century, communist understandings of religion have dominated the discourse. For Christianity, this relationship can be seen from the religion's earliest encounters in the country during the imperial period, with the Church of the East's interaction with the Emperor Taizong and Jesuit missionaries in the Ming court. But it has developed the most in the 20th and 21st centuries after the establishments of the Republic of China and People's Republic of China, especially through the establishment of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and rise of house churches. The influence of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) is also evident throughout much of German political theology. This is particularly clear in the work of the Roman Catholic theologian Johann Baptist Metz (born 1928) who explored the concept of political theology throughout his work. He argued for the concept of a \"suffering God\" who shared the pain of his creation, writing, \"Yet, faced with conditions in God's creation that cry out to heaven, how can the theology of the creator God avoid the suspicion of apathy unless it takes up the language of a suffering God?\" This leads Metz to develop a theology that is related to Marxism. He criticizes what he terms bourgeois Christianity and believes that the Christian Gospel has become less credible because it has become entangled with bourgeois religion. His work \"Faith in History and Society\" develops apologetics, or fundamental theology, from this perspective. Two of the other major developers of political theology in Germany were Jürgen Moltmann and Dorothee Sölle. As in Metz' work, the concept of a suffering God is important to Moltmann's theological program. Moltmann's political theology was influenced strongly by the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, and both Moltmann and Sölle were influenced heavily by liberation theology, as was Metz. Another early influence was the Frankfurt School of critical theory, especially Walter Benjamin, and the Frankfurt School's broader critique of modernity. Christian political theology in the Middle East is a religious response by Christian leaders and scholars to political problems. Political theologians try to balance the demands of a tumultuous region with the delicate but long history of Christianity in the Middle East. This has yielded a diversity of political theology disproportionate to the small size of Middle East Christian minorities. The region's importance to Christians worldwide – both for history and doctrinal authority for many denominations – also shapes the political theologies of the Middle East. For many Christian leaders, the dominant approach to political theology is one of survival. Many Arab Christians see themselves as the heirs of a rich Christian heritage whose existence is threatened by regional unrest and religious persecution. Their chief political goal is survival, which sets their political theology apart. At times, Arab Christian leaders have appealed to Christians outside the region through both denominational challenges and broader calls to Christian unity for humanitarian or political aid. In other cases, Christian politicians downplay their faith in the public sphere to avoid conflict with their Muslim neighbours. In the mid-20th century, many Christians in the Middle East saw secular politics as a way out of their traditional status as a minority community in the Islamic world. Christians played prominent roles throughout the pan-Arab nationalist movement in the mid-20th century, where their experience with Western politics and generally high educational attainments made their contributions valuable to nationalist governments around the region. One prominent example was Michel Aflaq, an Eastern Orthodox Christian who formed the first Ba'ath group from students in Damascus in the 1940s. His belief was that Christians should embrace Islam as part of their cultural identity because nationalism was the best way for Christians to be successful in the Middle East. Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa deals with the relationship of theology and politics, arising from the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and nationalist campaigns of the mid to late twentieth century elsewhere. The increasing numbers of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa has led to an increased interest in Christian responses to the region's continuing issues of poverty, violence, and war. According to the Cameroonian theologian and sociologist Jean-Marc Éla, African Christianity \"has to be formulated from the struggles of our people, from their joys, from their pains, from their hopes and from their frustrations today.\" African theology is heavily influenced by liberation theology, global black theology, and postcolonial theology. Notable thinkers include Itumeleng Mosala, Jesse N. K. Mugambi, and Desmond Tutu. Reinhold Niebuhr also developed a theology similar to Metz in the practical application of theology. During the 1930s, Niebuhr was a leader of the Socialist Party of America, and although he broke with the party later in life socialist thought is a prominent component of his development of Christian Realism. The work by Niebuhr that best exemplifies his relationship with political theology is \"Moral Man and Immoral Society: A Study of Ethics and Politics\" (1932). One of the most influential developers of recent political theology is Stanley Hauerwas, though he considers his work to be better termed a \"theological politics\". Hauerwas has actively critiqued the political theology of both Reinhold Niebuhr and H. Richard Niebuhr, and has been a frequently critic of Christians' attempt to attain political power and align themselves with secular political ideologies. Moreoever, he has been a severe critic of liberal democracy, capitalism, and militarism, arguing that all of those ideologies are antithetical to Christian convictions."]}

Humanoid scarecrows are usually dressed in old clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing crops. Scarecrows are used across the world by farmers, and are a notable symbol of farms and the countryside in popular culture.  The common form of a scarecrow is a humanoid figure dressed in old clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds such as crows or sparrows from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing crops. Machinery such as windmills have been employed as scarecrows, but the effectiveness lessens as animal become familiar with the structures.  Since the creation of the humanoid scarecrow, more effective methods have been developed. On California farmland, highly reflective aluminized PET film ribbons are tied to the plants to create shimmers from the sun. Another approach is using automatic noise guns powered by propane gas. One winery in New York uses inflatable tube men or airdancers to scare away birds. In \"Kojiki\", the oldest surviving book in Japan (compiled in the year 712), a scarecrow known as Kuebiko appears as a deity who cannot walk, yet knows everything about the world. Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story \"Feathertop\" is about a scarecrow created and brought to life in 17th century Salem, Massachusetts by a witch in league with the devil. The basic framework of the story was used by American dramatist Percy MacKaye in his 1908 play \"The Scarecrow\". L. Frank Baum's tale \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" has a scarecrow as one of the main protagonists. The Scarecrow of Oz was searching for brains from the Great Wizard. The scarecrow was portrayed by Frank Moore in the 1914 film \"His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz\", by Ray Bolger in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\", and by Michael Jackson in the 1978 musical film adaptation \"The Wiz\". Worzel Gummidge, a scarecrow who came to life in a friendly form, first appeared in series of novels by Barbara Euphan Todd in the 1930s and later in a popular television adaptation. The Scarecrow is the alter ego of the Reverend Doctor Christopher Syn, the smuggler hero in a series of novels written by Russell Thorndike. The story was made into the movie \"Doctor Syn\" in 1937, and again in 1962 as \"Captain Clegg\". It was taken up by Disney in 1963 and dramatized in the three-part TV miniseries \"The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh\" starring Patrick McGoohan; this was later re-edited and released theatrically as \"Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow\". A film directed by Jerry Schatzberg in 1973 starring Al Pacino and Gene Hackman is titled \"Scarecrow\" and deals with two characters on a journey reminiscent of the one in L. Frank Baum's book. The Scarecrow is a character in the DC Comics universe, a supervillain and antagonist of Batman; Cillian Murphy portrays the character in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Similar characters, known as Scarecrow and Straw Man, have appeared in Marvel Comics. British band Pink Floyd recorded a song called \"The Scarecrow\" for their debut album, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\". John Cougar Mellencamp's album \"Scarecrow\", which peaked at No. 2 in 1985, spawned five Top 40 singles including \"Rain on the Scarecrow\" (#21).  The song \"Scarecrow People\" on the XTC album \"Oranges & Lemons\" is a cautionary tale about the evolution of mankind to 'scarecrow people' who 'ain't got no brains' and 'ain't got no hearts' and are the result of humans destroying their world with wars and pollution. Melissa Etheridge recorded the song \"Scarecrow\" for her 1999 album \"Breakdown\". The song is actually about Matthew Shepard. The title makes reference to the bicyclist who found Shepard tied to a fence, who thought he was a scarecrow upon first glance.

Originally based on an idea imported from Derbyshire, it was the first Scarecrow Festival to be established in the whole of southern England.  Belbroughton, north Worcestershire, holds an annual \"Scarecrow Weekend\" on the last weekend of each September since 1996, which raises money for local charities. The village of Meerbrook in Staffordshire holds an annual Scarecrow Festival during the month of May. Tetford and Salmonby, Lincolnshire jointly host one. The festival at Wray, Lancashire was established in the early 1990s and continues to the present day. In the village of Orton, Eden, Cumbria scarecrows are displayed each year, often using topical themes such as a Dalek exterminating a Wind turbine to represent local opposition to a wind farm. The village of Blackrod, near Bolton in Greater Manchester, holds a popular annual Scarecrow Festival over a weekend usually in early July.  Norland, West Yorkshire has a Scarecrow festival. Kettlewell in North Yorkshire has held an annual festival since 1994. In Teesdale, County Durham, the villages of Cotherstone, Staindrop and Middleton-in-Teesdale have annual scarecrow festivals. Yeetland's first scarecrow festival was held in West Kilbride, North Ayrshire in 2004, and there is also one held in Montrose. On the Isle of Skye, the Tattie bogal event is held each year, featuring a scarecrow trail and other events. Tonbridge in Kent also host an annual Scarecrow Trail, organised by the local Rotary Club to raise money for local charities. Gisburn, Lancashire held its first Scarecrow Festival in June 2014. Mullion, in Cornwall, has an annual scarecrow festival since 2007. In the US, St. Charles, Illinois hosts an annual Scarecrow Festival.

The story revolves around the relationship between two men who travel from California, aiming to start a business in Pittsburgh. At the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, it tied for the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the highest honor. While a box office bomb in its own country, it later gained cult status. Two vagabonds, Max Millan, a short-tempered ex-convict, and Francis Lionel Delbuchi, a childlike ex-sailor, meet on the road in California and agree to become partners in a car wash business, once they reach Pittsburgh. Lion is on his way to Detroit to see the child he has never met and make amends with his wife Annie, whom he has been sending all the money he made while at sea. Max agrees to make a detour on his way to Pittsburgh, where the bank that Max has been sending all his seed money is located. While visiting Max's sister in Denver, the pair's antics land them in a prison farm for a month. Max blames Lionel for their being sent back to jail and shuns him. Lionel is befriended by a powerful inmate named Riley, who later tries to sexually assault Lionel, and while he does not succeed, physically savages and emotionally traumatizes Lionel. Max rekindles his friendship with Lionel, and becomes his protector, eventually exacting revenge by beating up Riley. After being released from prison, the two continue to have a profound effect on each other, although they have both undergone personal transformations and their roles have shifted—with Lionel still traumatized and no longer carefree and clowning nor able even to laugh or even smile, and Max loosening his high-strung aggression (at one point doing a tongue-in-cheek striptease to defuse a fight at a bar and to attempt to make Lionel laugh again). When the duo finally make it to Detroit, Lion finds a payphone and calls Annie, now remarried and raising their five-year-old son. Annie is still furious at Lion for having abandoned her, and lies that she miscarried their son (adding spitefully, knowing Lionel is Catholic, \"He never even got born. Never got baptized. You know what that means; his soul can't go to heaven. That's what you did for your son's soul, you bastard. You sent it into limbo. That soul cannot go to heaven\"). Lionel is devastated, as is Annie when he hangs up after hearing the \"news.\" When he gets off the phone, he acts overjoyed with Max about having a son. Shortly afterward, Lionel has a breakdown while playing in a city park with children and later on becomes catatonic. Max promises Lionel, now in a psychiatric hospital, that he will do anything to help him, and boards a train to Pittsburgh with a round-trip ticket. Warner Bros. approved the project, looking for a small-budget film after executives became less confident in the success of larger projects. Director Jerry Schatzberg's preference for the roles of Max and Lion were Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, and Schatzberg previously had worked with Pacino on \"The Panic in Needle Park\" (1971). To understand their characters, Pacino and Hackman costumed themselves and went begging in San Francisco. However, Pacino, an advocate of method acting, found his techniques conflicted with Hackman, who would be silent before shooting while Pacino paced. Although Hackman had fun with the production, Pacino later commented, \"It wasn't the easiest working with Hackman, who I love as an actor\". At the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, the film won the equivalent of the Palme d'Or of later years, the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, shared with \"The Hireling\" directed by Alan Bridges. It also won Best Non-European Film at Denmark's 1974 Bodil Awards. In the U.S., \"Scarecrow\" proved to be a box office bomb. In 1973, Roger Ebert gave it three stars, comparing the story to \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"Midnight Cowboy\", and positively reviewed the performances of Pacino and Hackman, the writing and setting. In \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby called Max and Lion \"classic drifters\" and \"marvelously realized characters\". In a review of the film from the time of its 2013 re-release, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" described the film as \"a freewheeling masterpiece\", describing Hackman and Pacino as giving \"the performances of their lives\". Peter Biskind, on the other hand, described the film as being of \"secondary\" significance in his book \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\". \"Scarecrow\" has an 82% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews. By 2012, \"Scarecrow\" was the best-reviewed film in Schatzberg's career. After gaining a cult following, Schatzberg had Seth Cohen write a sequel, with a screenplay completed by 2013. It would be set years later, with Max and computer worker Lion reuniting, and Lion learning his son is alive. The film sequel was made difficult, if not impossible, by the studio's lack of support and Hackman's retirement from acting.", "The Scarecrow (2013 film)\nThe Scarecrow (2013 film) The Scarecrow is a 2013 animated short film and advertisement by the American restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill. The film features Fiona Apple singing a cover version of \"Pure Imagination\", originally performed by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\". In a dystopian world, the main character, Scarecrow, starts work at the \"smoke-spewing\" Crow Foods Incorporated. He sees a tube extracting a substance labeled \"100% Beef-ish\", but being marketed to consumers as \"all natural\". He then witnesses a robotic crow injecting a chicken with green fluid to promote expansion, followed by cows being held captive in small metal boxes while machines continuously milk the cows forcefully. Scarecrow returns to his small farm, seemingly upset by what he witnessed during the workday. He picks a red pepper, which inspires him to harvest other vegetables and open a burrito stand in the city. Above his stand is a banner that reads \"Cultivate a Better World\". The computer-animated film features a cover version of \"Pure Imagination\" (Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley) by Fiona Apple, a song originally performed by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in the film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971), itself an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964). According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Apple's performance \"scores scenes of dark devastation\" and offers \"stark contrast between the world of pure imagination of the lyrics\" and the animals being processed. In the film, when Scarecrow returns home from work and picks a red pepper, the song transitions from \"mournful\" and \"menacing\" to a \"happier\" tone. Apple released the recording on iTunes, with proceeds benefiting the nonprofit organization, Chipotle Cultivation Foundation. \"The Scarecrow\" ends with a brief teaser for a mobile app game available for iPhones and iPads, where the player can take down the fictional Crow Foods. Chipotle described the film as a \"companion\" piece to the game. Chief Marketing Officer Mark Crumpacker stated that because his company \"is on a mission to change the way the world thinks of and eats fast food,\" they wished to inform the public about how the food they eat is raised. Brand Voice Lead William Espey added that they wanted to create \"this experience, this film and mobile game that would help us support that mission.\" Crumpacker also stated that the film depicts the \"elaborate facade that's been created by the industrial food producers,\" who have done a \"very good job of creating a rosy picture of their industry.\" The film reflects Chipotle's marketing strategy of avoiding television advertising; the company's goal is to come across as an alternative to factory farming and a more \"highbrow\" option over other fast food restaurants. \"The Scarecrow\" was animated by Moonbot Studios, a small firm co-founded by William Joyce and Brandon Oldenburg that won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2012. Moonbot liked Chipotle's food and ethos and created a video centered around scarecrows, which \"normally protect food,\" but in this film they protect \"something we call food, but it's something that seriously overproduced on a dramatic scale... which is not that far from the truth.\" Co-directors Oldenburg and Limbert Fabian found inspiration from \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", as well as from Fritz Lang's 1927 film \"Metropolis\". Chipotle originally selected Frank Ocean to perform \"Pure Imagination\" for the commercial, but he asked to be removed after the chain declined to remove its logo from the spot. He was ultimately replaced by Fiona Apple. In March 2014, Chipotle sued Ocean for the $212,500 advance that they had paid him to perform in the commercial. The lawsuit was dismissed later that month after Ocean repaid the advance in full. The short film was released on September 11, 2013. By September 19, it had been viewed 5.5 million times on YouTube. \"The Scarecrow\" has been praised as innovative marketing and a \"beautiful\" work of art. \"AdWeek\" felt that the effective animation and Apple's voice \"connects the viewer emotionally to the story,\" but felt that it was \"not quite as magical\" as Chipotle's similarly-themed \"Back to the Start\" video. The \"Los Angeles Times\" Randall Roberts called the film surreal, direct and \"visually magnetic\", and wrote that \"the song as covered by Apple is gorgeous, filled with electronic flourishes and rococo arrangements. The images imbue her version with a melancholy, but, taken on its own, the song shimmers.\" \"Slate\" Matthew Yglesias complimented the film's animation and music, and called the scene in which cows are seen in small crates \"the most poignant moment you've ever witnessed in fast food marketing\". He wrote that, if Chipotle's goal was to create \"high-quality high-impact stuff that really gets attention and is designed to be memorable\", the company was successful. Marketing reporter Bruce Horovitz, contributing for \"USA Today\", named it the fifth best advertisement of the year.

The film is the third in a series of films about Scarecrows who kill people. The first two are \"Scarecrow\" and \"Scarecrow Slayer\". both by The Asylum, a different production company. The film was directed and written by Brian Katkin. Ken Shamrock, former NWA World Heavyweight Champion, appears in the film as the coach. Despite portraying a secondary role, Shamrock received top billing. Sam (Caleb Roehrig) is one of the freshman on the baseball team who are being hazed by upperclassmen, including his friend Jack (Matthew Linhardt). Because Sam needs a scholarship to attend college, Jack gave him a urine sample so that no one would know he was diabetic and he would make the team, thus giving him a chance at a scholarship. Although Jack promises his coach that there will be no hazing, the rest of the team (and some girls) go to the haunted corn field and continue the hazing. The hazing ritual comes to a bitter end in a haunted cornfield when the baseball players mistake one of Sam's diabetic attacks with Sam trying to start a fight. They tie him up to the scarecrow and leave him for dead. Sam becomes the evil Scarecrow who decides to seek bloody revenge on his tormentors and pretty much everyone else in the film. The only way for Jack and his friends to stop the scarecrow is by getting their friend out of his coma, a task which proves to be near impossible since the nearest hospital is conveniently under construction. After a series of attacks by the scarecrow the students finally figure out how to stop him and bring back their friend. The movie skips to 3 weeks after the attacks, and show Jack and his new girlfriend (a survivor of the scarecrow's attack) getting ready to pick the coach up to take him to his red-eye flight, and Sam and baseball jock, Mike getting ready to attend a sorority party. Just as things are beginning to look up for our protagonists, Sam murders Mike and the coach. He then chases Jack and his girlfriend into a chapel where they battle for the final time. Suddenly the scarecrow (Sam) also has the power to shoot what looks like electrical currents out of his hands. Through their epic battle Jack somehow becomes the scarecrow and does the logical thing, impaling himself on a nearby cross."]}

During World War I he was a Leutnant in the Engineer Corps of the German Army. During the interwar period Hentze remained a member of the Reserver Officers Corps.  In 1935, while writing a book on Mathematics and Statistics, Hentze developed a keen interest in cryptanalysis. During the period from 1935 until the start of World War II, he was keenly interested in the mathematical relationship of the letter frequencies in various encipherment methods. At the outbreak of World War II, Hentze came to active duty as a Hauptmann Captain in charge of an engineer supply depot in the Bad Kreuznach area.

He was First Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration from 1999 to 2011, during which time he was widely seen as the main ideologist of the Kremlin who proposed and implemented the concept of sovereign democracy in Russia. From December 2011 until May 2013 Surkov served as the Russian Federation's Deputy Prime Minister. After his resignation, Surkov returned to the Presidential Executive Office and became a personal adviser of Vladimir Putin on relationships with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ukraine. Surkov is perceived by many to be a key figure with much power and influence in the administration of Vladimir Putin. According to \"The Moscow Times\", this perception is not dependent on the official title Surkov might hold at any one time in the Putin government. BBC documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis credits Surkov's blend of theater and politics with keeping Putin, and Putin's chosen successors, in power since 2000. Journalists in Russia and abroad have speculated that Surkov writes under the pseudonym Nathan Dubovitsky, although the Kremlin denies it. According to Surkov's official biography he was born 21 September 1964 in Solntsevo, Lipetsk Oblast. As per other statements he was born in Shali. His parents, the ethnic Russian Zinaida Antonovna Surkova (born 1935) and the ethnic Chechen Andarbek (Yuriy) Danil'bekovich Dudayev (born 1942) were school teachers in Duba-yurt, Checheno-Ingush SSR. Following the separation of his parents, his mother moved to Lipetsk. In an interview published in June 2005 in the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" Surkov stated that his father was ethnic Chechen and that he spent the first five years of his life in Chechnya in Duba-yurt and Grozny. From 1983 to 1985 Surkov served in a Soviet artillery regiment in Hungary, according to his official biography. However, former Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov stated in a 2006 TV interview that Surkov served in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) during the same time period. After his military training Surkov was accepted to Moscow Institute of Culture for a five-year program in theater direction, but spent only three years there. Surkov graduated from Moscow International University with a master's degree in economics in the late 1990s. In the late 1980s when the government lifted the ban against private businesses, Surkov started out in business. He became head of the advertising department of Mikhail Khodorkovsky's businesses. From 1991 to April 1996 he held key managerial positions in advertising and PR departments of Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep. From March 1996 to February 1997 he was at Rosprom and since February 1997 with Mikhail Fridman's Alfa-Bank. In September 2004 Surkov was elected president of the board of directors of the oil products transportation company Transnefteproduct, but was instructed by Russia's prime minister Mikhail Fradkov to give up the position in February 2006. After a brief career as a director for public relations on the Russian television ORT channel from 1998 to 1999, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the President of the Russian Federation in 1999. During the beginning of his time in this role, Surkov's main appearances in public and in international media were as a public relations mouthpiece of the Kremlin. In August 2000, he confirmed that Gazprom would buy Vladimir Gusinsky's Media-Most, which at the time owned the only independent, nationwide Russian television channel, NTV. In September 2002, he stated on behalf of the Kremlin that they had decided not to return the statue of KGB founder Felix Dzerzhinsky that had been torn down during the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the 2003 Russian Duma elections, when the president's United Russia party got the most seats at 37.6%, Surkov delivered the Kremlin's enthusiastic response, saying \"We are living in a new Russia now.\" In March 2004, he was additionally appointed as aide to the president. Since 2006, Surkov has advocated a political doctrine he has called sovereign democracy, to counter democracy promotion conducted by the USA and European states. Judged by some Western media as controversial, this view has not generally been shared by Russian media and the Russian political elite. Surkov sees this concept as a national version of the common political language that will be used when Russia talks to the outside world. As the most influential ideologist of \"sovereign democracy\", Surkov gave two programmatic speeches in 2006: \"Sovereignty is a Political Synonym of Competitiveness\" in February and \"Our Russian Model of Democracy is Titled Sovereign Democracy\" in June 2006. On 8 February 2007, Moscow State University marked the 125th anniversary of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birthday with a high-level conference \"Lessons of the New Deal for Modern Russia and the World\" attended, among others, by Surkov and Gleb Pavlovsky. Surkov drew an explicit parallel between Roosevelt and Russian president Putin, praising the legacy of Roosevelt's New Deal, and between the US of the 1930s and present-day Russia. Pavlovsky called on Putin to follow Roosevelt in staying for a third presidential term. According to \"The Moscow Times\", Surkov exerted his influence to have Ramzan Kadyrov appointed as acting Head of the Chechen Republic on 15 February 2007. Since this appointment, Kadyrov has gone on to serve two terms in office and has been accused of numerous humans rights abuses. In October 2009, Surkov warned that opening and modernization of Russia's political system, a need repeatedly stressed by President Dmitry Medvedev, could result in more instability, which \"could rip Russia apart\". In September 2011, Mikhail Prokhorov quit the Right Cause party, which he had led for five months. He condemned the party as a puppet of the Kremlin and named Surkov the \"'puppet master' in the president's office\" (), according to a report in Russian-language magazine \"Korrespondent\" picked up by \"The New York Times\". Prokhorov had hoped that Surkov would be fired from the Kremlin, but the Kremlin stood behind Surkov and said he would not disappear from the political stage. At that time \"Reuters\" described Surkov in a profile as the Kremlin's 'shadowy chief political strategist', one of the most powerful men in the Kremlin and considered a close ally of then-Prime Minister Putin. On 28 December 2011, Medvedev reassigned Surkov to the role of \"Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Modernisation\" in a move interpreted by many to be fallout from the controversial Russian parliamentary elections of 2011. At that time, Surkov described his past career as follows: 'I was among those who helped Boris Yeltsin to secure a peaceful transfer of power; among those who helped President Putin stabilize the political system; among those who helped President Medvedev liberalize it. All the teams were great.' During this time Surkov helped create some pro-government youth movements, including Nashi. He met with their leaders and participants several times and gave them lectures on the political situation. Nashi has been compared by Edward Lucas as the Putin government's version of the Soviet-era Komsomol. Since Putin's return to the presidency in 2012, Surkov became marginalized as Putin \"pursued a path of open repression over the cunning manipulation favoured by Surkov\". As a Deputy Prime Minister, Surkov criticized the Kremlin's Investigative Committee, which led investigations into opposition leaders, rather than the general prosecutor's office. The Committee stated he offered to resign on 7 May 2013, whereas Surkov stated he offered to resign on 28 April 2013. Putin signed it on 8 May 2013. During Putin's first two terms as president, Surkov was regarded as the Kremlin's \"grey cardinal\", due to crafting Russia's system of \"sovereign democracy\" and directing its propaganda principally through control of state run television. On 20 September 2013, Vladimir Putin appointed Surkov as his Aide in the Presidential Executive Office. He also became Putin's personal adviser on relationships with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ukraine. On 17 March 2014, the day after the Crimean status referendum, Surkov became one of the first eleven persons who were placed under executive sanctions on the Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN) by President Obama, freezing his assets in the US and banning him from entering the United States. Surkov responded to this by saying: \"The only things that interest me in the US are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg, and Jackson Pollock. I don’t need a visa to access their work.\" On 21 March 2014, the European Union (EU) placed Surkov on its sanction list barring him from entering the EU and freezing his assets in the EU. In February 2015, Ukrainian authorities accused Surkov of organizing snipers to kill protesters and police during the Ukrainian Euromaidan in January 2014. This accusation was dismissed by the Russian government as \"absurd\". Despite being barred from entering the EU, Surkov visited Greece's Mount Athos as a part of Putin's delegation to the holy site in May 2016. In October 2016, Ukrainian hacker group CyberHunta released over a gigabyte of emails and other documents alleged to belong to Surkov. The 2,337 emails belonged to the inbox of Surkov's office email account, prm_surkova@gov.ru. The Kremlin suggested that the leaked documents were fake. The emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine. The document release included a document sent by Denis Pushilin, former Chair of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic, listing casualties that occurred from 26 May to  6 June 2014. It also included a 22-page outline of \"a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in Kiev.\" Before the 2010 U.S.-Russia \"Civil Society to Civil Society\" (C2C) summit, a U.S. House of Representatives representative for the state of Florida's 27th district, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R), was the lead signatory of a written petition which called upon the Obama administration to suspend U.S. participation in the summit until Surkov was replaced as a delegate for the Russian side. In an interview with Radio Free Europe, Ros-Lehtinen explained that she objected to Surkov's attendance as she views him as \"one of the main propagators of limiting freedom of speech in Russia, intimidating Russian journalists and representatives of opposition political parties\". However, the summit went ahead despite her objections. A 2007 Open Source Center \"Media Aid\" document identifies the Russian \"ura.ru\" information website as reportedly having links to Surkov. Inside Russia, Surkov has drawn criticism from activists and opposition groups: In September 2010, Lyudmila Alexeyeva appealed to then-president Dmitry Medvedev to dismiss him. Opposition leaders Boris Nemtsov (Solidarnost), Vladimir Milov (Democratic Choice), and Vladimir Ryzhkov (People's Freedom Party) jointly demanded his resignation over policies perceived to threaten freedom of the press and journalists in Russia. Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, who played a key role in the Russian occupation of Crimea, referred to Surkov as a \"notorious\" person who \"focuses only on destruction...as in South Ossetia and other regions where he focused on looting rather than aide\" (). In 2013 Surkov was characterized by \"The Economist\" as the engineer of 'a system of make-believe', 'a land of imitation political parties, stage-managed media and fake social movements'. In Western media outside Russia, a vocal and eloquent critic of Surkov and of the administration of Vladimir Putin in general has been Peter Pomerantsev. Pomerantsev has written op-eds in \"The Atlantic\", \"The New York Times\", and the \"London Review of Books\" accusing Surkov, \"Putin's chief ideologue\" with \"unsurpassed influence over Russian politics\", of turning Russia into a \"managed democracy\", and of reducing Russian politics to nothing but \"postmodernist theatre\". In a talk before the Legatum Institute, Pomerantsev, along with Pavel Khodorkovsky, termed Russia a \"postmodern dictatorship\". On 13 August 2009, Russian business newspaper \"Vedomosti\" reported that an anonymous source told them that a recently released novel, \"Close to Zero\" (\"\"), was written by Surkov under the pseudonym Nathan Dubovitsky () in the magazine Russian Pioneer (). It was soon realized that the pseudonym is almost identical to the name of Surkov's second and current wife, Natalya Dubovitskaya (). In a subsequent edition of \"Close to Zero\", Surkov would write a preface to it under his real name, but would continue to deny writing the main text. In the preface, Surkov writes two seemingly contradictory statements: \"The author of this novel is an unoriginal Hamlet-obsessed hack\"; and, \"this is the best book I have ever read\". Furthermore, the debut performance of the theatrical version of the novel, directed by Kirill Serebrennikov, was attended by Surkov. The novel, which has the English language subtitle \"gangsta fiction\", has as its protagonist a man by the name of Yegor Samokhodov. Samokhodov's occupation is public relations, and he is tasked with managing the reputation of a regional governor. First, he hires a writer to ghostwrite a piece of poetry to be published under the name of the governor without disclosing the ghostwriting, so that the governor may win an award and seem clever to his constituents. He then bribes a newspaper reporter to \"correct\" stories that portray the governor negatively, such as allegations that a factory of a relative of his is releasing chemicals into the air that harm local children. The publishing houses and public relations firms in the novel are intensely violent, with each company having its own gang and turf wars being fought over the rights to publish or represent such acclaimed Russian authors as Alexander Pushkin and Vladimir Nabokov. Peter Pomerantsev described the book as \"exactly the sort of book Surkov's youth groups burn on Red Square.\" \"The Economist\" wrote that the novel \"expos[ed] the vices of the system [Surkov] himself had created\". Other works authored under the name Nathan Dubovitsky, all published in Russian Pioneer, that are rumored to be the work of Surkov are: Some outside Russia, such as Ned Reskinoff of ThinkProgress, and Adam Curtis in the BBC documentary \"HyperNormalisation\", have claimed that Surkov's unique blend of politics and reality have begun to affect countries outside of Russia, most notably the United States with the choosing of Donald Trump for the 2016 US Republican nomination and Trump's subsequent campaign and election victory. In an editorial for the London Review of Books quoted by Curtis, Peter Pomerantsev describes Putin's Russia thus: Curtis claims that Trump used a similar strategy to become president of the United States, and hints that Trump's Surkovian origins caused Putin to express his admiration for Trump in Russian media. Surkov has married twice. His first marriage was to Yulia Petrovna Vishnevskaya () in 1987, and it ended in divorce in 1996. Surkov married a second time in a civil ceremony in 1998 to Natalya Dubovitskaya, his secretary when he was an executive at the Menatep bank. Surkov has four children: Artem () (born 15 October 1993), the biological child of Yulia he adopted during his first marriage; and Roman () (born 2002), Maria () (born 2004), and Timur () (born 2010), biological children of his and Natalya's.

The image of the Southern belle developed in the South during the antebellum era. It was based on the young, unmarried woman in the plantation-owning upper class of Southern society.  The image of a Southern belle is often characterized by fashion elements such as a hoop skirt, a corset, pantalettes, a wide-brimmed straw hat, and gloves. As signs of tanning were considered working-class and unfashionable during this era, parasols and fans are also often represented. Southern belles were expected to marry respectable young men, and become ladies of society dedicated to the family and community. The Southern belle archetype is characterized by Southern hospitality, a cultivation of beauty, and a flirtatious yet chaste demeanor. For example, Sallie Ward, who was born into the Southern aristocracy of Kentucky in the Antebellum South, was called a Southern belle. The Southern belle archetype has been criticized as part of an overall idealization of the Antebellum era American South in popular culture.

The gardens were originally part of the 1750 Dean Hall rice plantation, which depended on fresh water from the Cooper River. The area that is now a swamp was dug out and fitted with water gates to become a fresh water reservoir. It had fallen into disuse when the property was purchased by Benjamin Kittredge for a duck hunting reserve. During the depression, over 200 men built out the of trails around the swamp. It was opened to the public in 1932. Kittredge's son donated the property to the City of Charleston on June 1, 1963. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 severely affected the park, causing it to close for a year. Berkeley County took over ownership when the City of Charleston no longer wanted to support the garden. In October 2015 historic flooding hit the state of South Carolina that greatly impacted the botanical preserve.

{"query": "Busby Berkeley directing style instead of choreography in 42nd Street film", "pos": ["Busby Berkeley\nBusby Berkeley Busby Berkeley (born Berkeley William Enos; November 29, 1895 – March 14, 1976) was an American film director and musical choreographer. Berkeley devised elaborate musical production numbers that often involved complex geometric patterns. Berkeley's works used large numbers of showgirls and props as fantasy elements in kaleidoscopic on-screen performances. Berkeley was born in Los Angeles, California, to Francis Enos (who died when Busby was eight) and stage actress Gertrude Berkeley (1864–1946). Among Gertrude's friends, and a performer in Tim Frawly's Stock company run by Busby Berkeley's father, were actress Amy Busby from which Berkeley gained the appellation \"Buzz\" or \"Busby\" and actor William Gillette, then only four years away from playing Sherlock Holmes. Whether he was actually christened Busby Berkeley William Enos, or Berkeley William Enos, with \"Busby\" being a nickname, is not unanimous – the \"Child's names\" entry on his birth certificate is blank. In addition to her stage work, Gertrude played mother roles in silent films while Berkeley was still a child. Berkeley made his stage début at five, acting in the company of his performing family. In 1917, he lived in Athol, Massachusetts, working as an advertising and sales manager. During World War I, Berkeley served as a field artillery lieutenant. Watching soldiers drill may have inspired his later complex choreography. During the 1920s, Berkeley was a dance director for nearly two dozen Broadway musicals, including such hits as \"A Connecticut Yankee\". As a choreographer, Berkeley was less concerned with the dancing skill of his chorus girls as he was with their ability to form themselves into attractive geometric patterns. His musical numbers were among the largest and best-regimented on Broadway. His earliest film work was in Samuel Goldwyn's Eddie Cantor musicals, where he began developing such techniques as a \"parade of faces\" (individualizing each chorus girl with a loving close-up), and moving his dancers all over the stage (and often beyond) in as many kaleidoscopic patterns as possible. Berkeley's top shot technique (the kaleidoscope again, this time shot from overhead) appeared seminally in the Cantor films, and also the 1932 Universal drama film \"Night World\" (where he choreographed the number \"Who's Your Little Who-Zis?\"). His numbers were known for starting out in the realm of the stage, but quickly exceeding this space by moving into a time and place that could only be cinematic, only to return to shots of an applauding audience and the fall of a curtain. He used only one camera to achieve this, instead of the usual four, to retain control over his vision so no director could edit the film. As choreographer, Berkeley was allowed a certain degree of independence in his direction of musical numbers, and they were often markedly distinct from (and sometimes in contrast to) the narrative sections of the films. He often didn't even see the other sections of the picture. The numbers he choreographed were mostly upbeat and focused on decoration as opposed to substance some costing around $10,000 a minute, more than the picture they were in. One exception to this is the number \"Remember My Forgotten Man\" from \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", which dealt with the treatment of World War I veterans during The Great Depression. Berkeley's popularity with an entertainment-hungry Great Depression audience was secured when he choreographed four musicals back-to-back for Warner Bros.: \"42nd Street\", \"Footlight Parade\", the aforementioned \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", \"Dames\", and \"Fashions of 1934\", as well as \"In Caliente\" and \"Wonder Bar\" with Dolores del Río. Berkeley always denied any deep significance to his work, arguing that his main professional goals were to constantly top himself and to never repeat his past accomplishments. As the outsized musicals in which Berkeley specialized became passé, he turned to straight directing. The result was 1939's \"They Made Me a Criminal\", one of John Garfield's best films. Berkeley had several well-publicized run-ins with MGM stars such as Judy Garland. In 1943, he was removed as director of \"Girl Crazy\" because of disagreements with Garland, although the lavish musical number \"I Got Rhythm\", which he directed, remained in the picture. His next stop was at 20th Century-Fox for 1943's \"The Gang's All Here\", in which Berkeley choreographed Carmen Miranda's \"Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat\" number. The film made money, but Berkeley and the Fox brass disagreed over budget matters. Berkeley returned to MGM in the late 1940s, where among many other accomplishments he conceived the Technicolor finales for the studio's Esther Williams films. Berkeley's final film as choreographer was MGM's \"Billy Rose's Jumbo\" (1962). In the late 1960s, the camp craze brought the Berkeley musicals back to the forefront. He toured the college and lecture circuit, and even directed a 1930s-style cold medication commercial for Contac capsules entitled the \"\"Cold Diggers of 1969\",\" complete with a top shot of a dancing clock. In his 75th year, Berkeley returned to Broadway to direct a successful revival of \"No No Nanette\" starring his old Warner Brothers colleague and \"42nd Street\" star Ruby Keeler; both also played cameos in the 1970 film \"The Phynx\" the same year. Berkeley was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1988. Berkeley was married six times including to Merna Kennedy, Esther Muir and starlet Claire James, and was survived by his wife Etta Dunn. He was also involved in an alienation of affections lawsuit in 1938 involving Carole Landis, and was engaged to Lorraine Stein. Berkeley drank heavily, often drinking martinis in his daily bath. After his mother’s death and his career began to slow, he attempted suicide by slitting his wrists and taking an overdose of sleeping pills. He was taken to the hospital and kept there for many days, which experience severely affected his mental state. In September 1935, Berkeley was the driver responsible for an automobile accident in which two people were killed, five seriously injured; Berkeley himself was badly cut and bruised. Berkeley, brought to court on a stretcher, heard testimony that \"Time\" magazine said made him wince: After the first two trials for second degree murder ended with hung juries, he was acquitted in a third trial. Berkeley died on March 14, 1976 in Palm Springs, California at the age of 80 from natural causes.

Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\". As per Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 1990, the prize is awarded on 10 December in Oslo City Hall each year. The prize was formerly awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law (1947–1989), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946), and the Parliament (1901–1904). Due to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of controversies. According to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who in the preceding year \"shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\". Alfred Nobel's will further specified that the prize be awarded by a committee of five people chosen by the Norwegian Parliament. Nobel died in 1896 and he did not leave an explanation for choosing peace as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer, the categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category. Some Nobel scholars suggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces. His inventions included dynamite and ballistite, both of which were used violently during his lifetime. Ballistite was used in war and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks in the 1880s. Nobel was also instrumental in turning Bofors from an iron and steel producer into an armaments company. It is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway, which was ruled in union with Sweden at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee speculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the prize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as Sweden. It also notes that at the end of the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament had become closely involved in the Inter-Parliamentary Union's efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration. The Norwegian Parliament appoints the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Each year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee specifically invites qualified people to submit nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation specify categories of individuals who are eligible to make nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. These nominators are: Nominations must usually be submitted to the Committee by the beginning of February in the award year. Nominations by committee members can be submitted up to the date of the first Committee meeting after this deadline. In 2009, a record 205 nominations were received, but the record was broken again in 2010 with 237 nominations; in 2011, the record was broken once again with 241 nominations. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation do not allow information about nominations, considerations, or investigations relating to awarding the prize to be made public for at least 50 years after a prize has been awarded. Over time, many individuals have become known as \"Nobel Peace Prize Nominees\", but this designation has no official standing, and means only that one of the thousands of eligible nominators suggested the person's name for consideration. Indeed, in 1939, Adolf Hitler received a satirical nomination from a member of the Swedish parliament, mocking the (serious but unsuccessful) nomination of Neville Chamberlain. Nominations from 1901 to 1956, however, have been released in a database. Nominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a short list of candidates for further review is created. This short list is then considered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the Institute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian academics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize. Advisers usually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the Committee to select the laureate. The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous decision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes to a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not been made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the beginning of October. The Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway on 10 December each year (the anniversary of Nobel's death). The Peace Prize is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm. The Nobel laureate receives a diploma, a medal, and a document confirming the prize amount. , the prize was worth 10 million SEK (about US$1.5 million). Since 1990, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony is held at Oslo City Hall. From 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, a few hundred metres from Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the ceremony took place at the Norwegian Nobel Institute. From 1901 to 1904, the ceremony took place in the \"Storting\" (Parliament). It has been expressed that the Peace Prize has been awarded in politically motivated ways for more recent or immediate achievements, or with the intention of encouraging future achievements. Some commentators have suggested that to award a peace prize on the basis of unquantifiable contemporary opinion is unjust or possibly erroneous, especially as many of the judges cannot themselves be said to be impartial observers. In 2011, a feature story in the Norwegian newspaper \"Aftenposten\" contended that major criticisms of the award were that the Norwegian Nobel Committee ought to recruit members from professional and international backgrounds, rather than retired members of parliament; that there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize; and that the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict. In the article, Norwegian historian Øivind Stenersen argues that Norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation building and furthering Norway's foreign policy and economic interests. In another 2011 \"Aftenposten\" opinion article, the grandson of one of Nobel's two brothers, Michael Nobel, also criticised what he believed to be the politicisation of the award, claiming that the Nobel Committee has not always acted in accordance with Nobel's will. Norwegian lawyer Fredrik S. Heffermehl has criticized the management of the Peace Prize. The awards given to Mikhail Gorbachev, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Menachem Begin and Yasser Arafat, Lê Đức Thọ, Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, the IPCC, Liu Xiaobo, Aung San Suu Kyi Barack Obama, and the European Union have all been the subject of controversy. The awards given to Lê Đức Thọ and Henry Kissinger prompted two dissenting Committee members to resign. Thọ refused to accept the prize, on the grounds that such \"bourgeois sentimentalities\" were not for him and that peace had not actually been achieved in Vietnam. Kissinger donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony and later offered to return his prize medal after the fall of South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces 18 months later. \"Foreign Policy\" has listed Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, U Thant, Václav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Fazle Hasan Abed and Corazon Aquino as people who \"never won the prize, but should have\".  The omission of Mahatma Gandhi has been particularly widely discussed, including in public statements by various members of the Nobel Committee. The Committee has confirmed that Gandhi was nominated in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947, and, finally, a few days before his assassination in January 1948. The omission has been publicly regretted by later members of the Nobel Committee. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\". In 1948, following Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the ground that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" that year. Later, when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\". , the Peace Prize has been awarded to 104 individuals and 23 organizations. Sixteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize, more than any other Nobel Prize. Only two recipients have won multiple Prizes: the International Committee of the Red Cross has won three times (1917, 1944, and 1963) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won twice (1954 and 1981).

The prize is awarded by Mifal HaPayis (Israel's state lottery), and is a part of the organization's cultural initiatives. It carries the name of the late Pinhas Sapir, a former Finance Minister of Israel, and was first awarded in 2000. The Sapir Prize, based on the British Man Booker Prize, is the most lucrative literary prize awarded in Israel. The winner receives 150,000 NIS (roughly 39,000 USD), and while the remaining final contestants are each awarded 25,000 NIS. In addition, the winner is granted translation of his work (from Hebrew) to the language of his choice. The group of judges for the prize is composed of prominent literary figures, whose names are kept confidential until the prize winner is named. Some of these judges are replaced from year to year. The judges first select five books published during the previous year as final contestants for the prize. These books are selected from a list of books provided by the major publishing houses. After a number of weeks, a winner is chosen from these five books and is publicised during Israel's Hebrew Book Week. The five finalist authors participate in a round of literary get-togethers with readers throughout Israel with the backing of Israel's state lottery. In 2005, the state lottery ran a competition allowing readers to bet on the winner of the prize; the first 30 people to guess the winner correctly received the five finalist books. In 2003, author Etgar Keret's book of short stories \"Anihu\" was disqualified from competing for the prize after it was discovered that the regulations required all competing books to run at least 60,000 words. This rule has since been abolished. In 2006, in response to many petitions, the prize's management decided to open up the competition to works published in the previous five years which had been translated into Hebrew from other languages. All competing authors must be Israeli citizens. The change was intended to allow Israeli authors writing in Russian, Arabic, English, and additional languages to compete. These authors can compete either in the normal prize track, or in a separate track specifically for translated works, from which only one work is selected. Prizewinners are given funding to have their work translated into Arabic and one other foreign language. The prize's awarding ceremony is broadcast every year on television during Israel's Hebrew Book Week. In 2015 the prize rules were changed, only residents of Israel are eligible. The Sapir Prize has been criticized on the grounds that it is given to bestsellers. Some of the country's most important writers refuse to submit their candidacy for it, including Meir Shalev, Aharon Appelfeld, A.B. Yehoshua and Amos Oz. In 2014, for the first time, the award was won by a writer (Reuven Namdar) living outside Israel. Thereafter, it was decided that only candidates resident in Israel would be eligible to submit their works for the prize. Critics of this decision have said that for a language to isolate itself, and to restrict its literature to local concerns, is to stifle it. However, others have argued that literary funding is in short supply in Israel, and would be best directed at local authors rather than those living more comfortably abroad."]}

As of the 2010 census, the population was 75,390, down from 75,837 at the 2000 census. Baldwin Park began as part of cattle grazing land belonging to the San Gabriel Mission. It eventually became part of the Rancho Azusa de Dalton and the Rancho La Puente properties. The community became known as Vineland in 1860. By 1906 it changed to Baldwin Park. It was named after Elias J. \"Lucky\" Baldwin. In 1956 Baldwin Park became the 47th incorporated city in the State of California. Currently the city is pushing to revitalize its economic base. There are six active Project Redevelopment Areas located in strategic areas of the city. Projects within these redevelopment areas are as diverse, including high-quality senior housing, Home Depot, Starbucks, Harley Davidson, a transit oriented district (TOD) near the Metrolink Train Station and various other thriving businesses. Baldwin Park is home to the first In-N-Out burger stand, opened on October 22, 1948. It was the first drive-thru in California and was replaced in November 2004 with a new building. The new In-N-Out University and company store opened in 2006 on Francisquito Avenue. Also, the company's first meatpacking plant is located down the street from the locations at the company headquarters on Hamburger Lane. In/N/Out now has a second meat processing plant in Texas to serve their Texas restaurants. As of September 1882, the first school house was built on the southeast corner of North Maine and Los Angeles Avenues in 1884. It contained two rows of double seats, a central aisle leading to the teacher's desk, and a heating stove at the north end. Mr. Frazier was the first teacher. In April 1888, The Vineland School District was established according to county records. The first Board of Trustees took office on July 1, 1888, and elected Miss Jessie Washburn to teach the district school that fall. The building was sold in 1890 and moved to another site for a private residence. The district built the second school in 1890 and hired two teachers, Miss Ellen Lang and Miss Venna O. Finney. The second school house was relegated to the past in 1912. It later became a private Japanese school and stood as a landmark until it caught fire on September 5, 1936, and burned to the ground. Today, the Baldwin Park Unified School District lies contiguously with the city's borders. There are 23 schools within this district. The budget is well over $100 million. Currently the district is building new school structures to accommodate growth. The district is adopting data driven strategies to help students achieve better scores in the API tests. There is an active push by the district to hire new teachers while providing retirement incentives for teachers who wish to retire. In the 1950s Vias Turkey Ranch was about one mile (1.6 km) from the now 10 Freeway just off of Frazier Avenue. This huge commercial turkey ranch was famous in the Valley for a huge outdoor aviary with a unique selection of birds. The ranch had two or three types of deer species. When the value of the land escalated, the property was sold and the Ranch moved to Apple Valley. The McMullan Dairy was on Frazier where area schools brought students on field trips. Popular pastimes in the 1950s included riding at the horse stables across the bridge of the San Gabriel River, which was an open sand and rock river bed, and ride one hour for the sum of $1.00, a hefty price at that time considering that the minimum wage was fifty cents an hour. In summer 2005, Save Our State, an anti-illegal immigration group based in Ventura, launched a series of protests against the \"Danzas Indigenas,\" art at the Baldwin Park Metrolink station designed for the MTA in 1993 by artist Judy Baca. The monument bears several engraved statements whose origins are not attributed. At issue was one particular inscription--\"It was better before they came\"—that Save Our State claimed was directed against Anglo whites. In fact, according to Baca, that sentence was uttered by an Anglo white Baldwin Park resident in the 1950s; he was lamenting the influx of persons of Mexican ancestry into the San Gabriel Valley following World War II. Save Our State continued the protests, which drew counter-protesters and required city expenditure on crowd control and riot police. Save Our State stopped protesting towards the end of the summer and has not made any further appearances in the city. Baldwin Park experiences a mild winter and warm to hot summer.

The season concluded on May 10, 2001, after 21 episodes. The season originally aired on Thursdays at 8 pm ET. The series was moved to Wednesday nights on December 21, 2000. The first season of Gilmore Girls introduces Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her sixteen-year-old daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), as well as the fictional Connecticut town of Stars Hollow and its many quirky inhabitants. The central plot point of the season is Rory’s acceptance to Chilton, an elite prep school, and Lorelai’s need to borrow money from her parents, Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Herrmann), in order to fund her daughter’s education. Lorelai’s parents lend her the money, but on one condition: she and Rory must attend dinner at their home in nearby Hartford every Friday night until the loan is repaid. Lorelai’s relationship with her parents is full of animosity as, not long after giving birth to Rory at age sixteen, she left her parents’ home and moved to Stars Hollow in order to keep them from imposing their privileged lifestyle on her daughter. Her parents, while still loving her a great deal, continue to resent her for this choice. This results in a significant portion of the conflict throughout the season as Lorelai deals with having her parents in her life on a regular basis for the first time since she was a teenager. It also leads to Lorelai feeling distressed by Rory’s positive relationship with her grandparents and obvious interest in their way of life. In the pilot episode, Rory meets Dean Forester (Jared Padalecki), a new student at Stars Hollow High School who has a crush on her. As the season progresses, she grows to have feelings for him, and they begin dating. Their relationship is briefly interrupted after Dean breaks up with her for not knowing how to respond to his stating that he loves her. Rory professes her love for Dean in the season finale, and they resume their relationship. The season shows Rory as having strong friendships with both longtime friend Lane Kim (Keiko Agena) and fellow Chilton student Paris Geller (Liza Weil). She has been friends with Lane for over a decade, and the two remain close even when Rory changes schools. When Rory first arrives at Chilton, her relationship with Paris is more that of enemies than friends. However, as the season progresses, the two grow closer, eventually forming a begrudging friendship. Lorelai has no love interest when the series begins, but she soon develops feelings for Rory’s English teacher at Chilton, Max Medina (Scott Cohen). They date for several episodes, but break up when Lorelai begins to feel uncomfortable about how accepting Rory is of having Max in their lives. There is a clear attraction between her and Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), the owner of the local diner, but nothing ever comes of it. Lorelai also briefly reunites with Rory’s father, Christopher (David Sutcliffe), but turns him down when he asks her to marry him. Lorelai and Max reunite toward the end of the season, and he proposes in the season finale. Lorelai is close friends with Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy), the chef at the inn she manages. The two plan to eventually open their own inn together. The season was produced by Warner Bros., Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel Palladino and was aired on the WB Network in the U.S. The series was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, who acted as an executive producer.

{"query": "League for Social Reconstruction political goals instead of Jean Palardy's membership", "pos": ["League for Social Reconstruction\nLeague for Social Reconstruction The League for Social Reconstruction (LSR) was a circle of Canadian socialist intellectuals officially formed in 1932, though it had its beginnings during a camping retreat in 1931. These academics were advocating radical social and economic reforms and political education. Industrialization, urbanization, war, and the Great Depression provoked formation of the LSR. Industrialization promoted urbanization, and the creation of elaborate bureaucratic systems, and, from the perspective of the LSR, here began the problem. The complexities of economy and society had grown, but government was infused with laissez-faire ideology and did not regulate finance or industry, or, as the LSR believed, government regulations suited private rather than public interest. Rationalistic moralism led the League to believe their expertise could stop the suffering of fellow Canadians, and rationalistic elitism led the League to believe they were best situated to unpack the intricacies of modern society. The League felt they should provide expert advice to government, but socialist ideology led the League to believe that Canadian government was debauched. Hence, in order to guide Canadians toward socialism, the LSR planned to institutionalize expert intellectual advice in an extra-political organization, and to act as an independent adjunct to public policy formation. Promoting socialism, and working beyond politics, the LSR was able to transcend party alliances, and worked with both intellectuals and politicians to help quell the Depression through fiscal centralization and national social assistance. The significance of the League was its role as a concentrated group of intellectual elites who made social planning relevant in a Canadian context. The LSR formally disbanded in 1942 as the Canadian government was implementing a version of social planning as part of their World War II homefront plans. The Canadian economy had boomed during the late 1920s and showed no sign of weakness, but during the 1930s the Great Depression swept across Canada and provoked mass unemployment, and this incited the LSR into action. The LSR believed that the roots of the Depression were laissez-faire capitalism and governance, and that the \"free\" market was anything but. Politicians worked closely with business, securing interest-free loans, developing tariffs, and managing labour disputes; in short: manipulating markets. A small group of political businessmen controlled public policy and economic development, and guided the centralization of finance and power into private hands. Widespread unemployment marked the Depression, and served to underscore financial inequity. In the eyes of the LSR, the problem facing Canada was not an economic depression, it was a corrupt political economy. Faced with what they believed to be profiteering politicians, a group of men and women were united in their resolve that this could not stand. Three key influences stood out among the members of this group: religious affiliation, maturation in an environ of war and urbanization, and intellectual cultivation in the university environment. These characteristics defined the group's ideals, and set them apart from other social groups as a new elite; an exclusive group of righteous intellectual radicals. Believing the existing system was not practicable, the League set about establishing a new system. The solution to end this and all depressions would be a planned economy, and the transformation of Canada from a royal commonwealth into a socialist commonwealth. To achieve this transformation, the League planned to perform research, and apply the results toward public education and public policy. However, because the LSR believed that the system was not only corrupt but corruptive, the League planned to lay their foundations beyond politics. Public education would take the form of books and lectures, and influence over policy would be achieved through the institutionalization of expert intellectuals. Politicians would call upon the League's extra-political organization to perform research, and recommend policy. In this way, the League hoped to minimize partisanship, and influence government policy writ large. However, the ideals of the LSR found them working closest with one political party in particular, the avowedly socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). The Great Depression resulted in a protracted period of mass unemployment, and it was the impact unemployment had on Canadians that motivated the LSR into action. National unemployment peaked in the first half of 1933 at 32%; but 32% was only the average, in some towns unemployment reached nearly 50%. The LSR were roused, as they faced the ravages of unemployment in their classrooms, churches, and offices; \"Everywhere hopelessness. A country without a purpose ... An industrious and intelligent people going to waste in idleness and despair.\" For the LSR, the Depression was the inexorable result of laissez-faire philosophy. This philosophy had spread since the Act of Union in 1840, which began a transition from power structures that favoured aristocracy to structures that favoured business. Responsible government arrived shortly after the union, and shifted influence from the governor to ministers. Powers that had previously been focused in the governor, became divided among ministers. No meaningful administrative structures were implemented to ensure that ministers remained responsive to the public, and ministers aligned themselves with capitalists. Free market governance became the consort of free market capitalization. Legislation regulating conflicts of interest did not exist, and politicians worked openly with business. One former prime minister made the marriage of business with politics strikingly clear when he stated \"my politics are railroads.\"<ref name=\"Christian/Campbell p.79\">Christian & Campbell (1983), p. 79</ref> The developmental history of Canada's political economy was central in the analysis of the LSR, and they later observed that \"[m]onopolies are not an unlucky accident in our economic system, they are our economic system.\" Previous economic fluctuations had not created the need for federal unemployment programs, and policy and tradition dictated that assistance was a local issue, because traditionally it had been locally tractable. Under the British North America Act of 1867 (BNA), government received most revenue collection powers, and provinces became responsible for social relief, education, and health care. However, 60 years had passed since the BNA, and this was a different economy. The National Policy dramatically increased prairie populations, and when Depression hit, the prairies in particular could not manage social relief, and, along with other provinces, asked for federal aid. Federal politicians believed free markets would rebalance themselves, and refused assistance. Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King refused to attempt relief, claiming it would endanger the national budget. Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett declared that provinces should reduce wasteful spending. Laissez-faire ideology underpinned the policies of Liberals and Conservatives alike. Provinces became disgruntled, relationships with Ottawa became strained, and so it was that the crisis of capitalism triggered a crisis of federalism. \"Here was the proof that the [political economy] built by the businessman and the old party politician was defective. The men who had presided over the construction of a complex modern civilization apparently did not know how to keep it running smoothly.\" In November 1930, the problems of political economy were the focus of discussion for a group of \"radically minded [professors],\" organized by University of Toronto Historian Frank Underhill. At the same time in Montreal, McGill University Law Professor F. R. Scott was preparing a book examining the same problems. In August 1931, the two men met and discovered they had developed a similar analysis; instability and depression were born of a capitalistic political economy, and any permanent solution would be born of democratic socialism. Underhill proposed the formation of a research organization, styled after the British Fabians, modified to suit Canada. The organization's ideas would be spread in two ways; directly into the public mind through local associations and literature; and directly into government through an institution of intellectual elites that politicians could requisition to perform research and recommend policy. Scott agreed. Underhill also believed a socialist political party would shortly appear, and that there \"should be a group of intellectuals that could provide the new party with a coherent platform.\" The men returned home, and Underhill established a group in Toronto while Scott did the same in Montreal. These groups shared one important belief; that the objective study of social science yielded an inescapable conclusion: scientific socialism. Theirs was a scholarly disposition, and shared intellectualism aroused an elitist camaraderie. Educational distinction provided the group with a sense they were distinguished from the public and public servants; that amongst all reformists, they alone possessed the expertise necessary to develop corrective policies. The result was a highly principled and elitist political reformism, however this reformism was not solely rationalistic in origin. The twin inclinations of intellectual solidarity and moral solidarity motivated these academics. They were endowed not only with higher education, but also a belief in a higher purpose. Moralism was important to the group, and had been engendered through lifelong religious association. Though not all members remained religious in adulthood, most had been influenced by religion since youth. A partial survey of the League's leading members reveals the following; Frank Underhill: Flavelle scholar, raised a Presbyterian; F. R. Scott: Rhodes scholar, son of an archdeacon; Eugene Forsey: Rhodes scholar, son of a Methodist clergyman; Eric A. Havelock: respected economist, Christian Socialist; David Lewis: Rhodes scholar, a secular Jew, but deeply influenced by the Social Gospel and the Jewish Labour Movement. Artists who were among its early members included Jean Palardy and Jori Smith, both of Montreal. Three important commonalities stood out among the LSR's founding members. Religion imbued an indelible morality; war and urbanization prompted sober reflection on suffering and reform; and modern education in the social sciences produced a propensity for rational analysis and a deterministic bent. Scott and Underhill's groups exchanged drafts for a manifesto, attempting to strike a balance between pragmatism and radicalism. Their goal was to motivate all Canadians to critically examine Canada's political economy, and because the group did not want radicalism scaring potential members away, they opted to avoid inclusion of the one word that best explained their politics: \"socialism\". Drafts were exchanged for many months, and eventually a meeting was scheduled in Toronto, for February 23, 1932. Seventy-five men and women attended the meeting, ratified the manifesto, and discussed the selection of a name. The Montreal group suggested the \"League for Economic Democracy\", however the winning moniker came from the Torontonians, and when proceedings concluded the League for Social Reconstruction was born. Later in 1932, the socialist party Underhill predicted materialized as the CCF. The CCF were social democrats, and held the same ideas as the LSR regarding state theory, and hence the CCF were the LSR's best option for access to parliament. The CCF was also the best option for another reason: J.S. Woodsworth, honorary president of the LSR, was also leader of the CCF. Because the LSR had been established outside the political system, the question was how to structure the relationship between the League and the CCF. d on the stated goal of education, and it was not clear they would stay if the LSR became the organ of a political party. Woodsworth proposed a solution for members of the LSR who desired affiliation; CCF Clubs. Club membership brought affiliation, and LSR members could thus affiliate with the CCF independently of affiliation with the LSR. The LSR was thus able to move forward as an independent research organization. To promote and improve their ideas, the League discussed political economy with intellectuals and politicians across the nation. The LSR believed that because the Depression was national, its solution would be national as well, and they found sympathetic analyses amongst the intellectual community. Intellectuals concerned with social reform began to contemplate national reform. Common ground between the LSR and intellectual elites provided a program for action. Intellectuals felt that they needed to convince Canadians that government should assume an interventionist role; financial and social policies should be implemented at the national level, and stability would flow top downwards. Such an arrangement was not however possible under the BNA, and accordingly, the constitution would require modification. By the mid-1930s, many modern intellectuals found work in government, and political bodies began to seek advice from extra-parliamentary intellectuals. In 1935, extra-political intellectual elites were included in a national conference on Dominion-provincial relations, however the conference's primary purpose was to stop the flow of federal money to provinces, which was not what intellectuals had in mind. The initiatives put into place after the conference proved unproductive, and the movement was transmuted into the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations. The Commission was placed under the control of modern social scientists, including LSR member Frank Scott, and was instructed to provide recommendations for securing the economy and the federation. In 1940, the Commission reported that the Depression resulted from problems in the definition of the Canadian Dominion; the BNA had developed in the context of a wheat-timber-fish economy, and could not support Canada's mixed and industrializing economy. Industrial growth had increased the complication of economic activity, but the political system had not made corresponding advancements. To solve the Depression, the taxation powers and fiscal responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments required readjustment. The government should control all unemployment insurance programs, assume all provincial debts, collect all income taxes, and make equalization payments to needy provinces. Premiers met the Prime Minister in 1941 to discuss the recommendations, and with war raging in Europe, the Premiers agreed to the Commission's proposals. After the war, Prime Minister King was eager to preserve the government's new powers, and a separate agreement was reached with the provinces, making the Commission's recommendations into permanent policy. Politicians of all stripes were eager to mitigate against the economic and social problems experienced after World War One, and acceded to the implementation of central planning measures. Reflecting on the Commission, historian Doug Owram noted that the report \"was not so much the product of the public hearings as ... of the intellectual network of the 1930's... Indeed, the results of the study had been conceived even before its appointment.\" The report itself became a vehicle for shaping data in such a fashion that it supported the conclusions of the intellectuals who wrote it, with an eye towards converting its readers into advocates of centralization. The ideas of the LSR proved instrumental in introducing successful social planning measures into government, however disenchantment with socialism however had grown as World War Two approached, and the LSR itself was reduced to the point of dissolution. With CCF related activities expanding, the League finally disbanded in 1942. In the mid-1940s two members of the LSR held prominent positions within the CCF: Frank Scott became the National Chairman, and Professor George M. A. Grube became the president of the Ontario CCF. The LSR made its views known through the magazine \"New Commonwealth\" (formerly the \"Farmer's Sun\", publication of the United Farmers of Ontario until purchased by Graham Spry). The group further contributed to Canada's political and intellectual fields with two books, \"Social Planning for Canada\" (1935) and \"Democracy Needs Socialism\" (1938). \"Canadian Forum\" was saved from bankruptcy by the LSR, which was acquired in the journal in 1936 and continued its publication.

The enabling legislation consists of Acadia University Act and the Amended Acadia University Act 2000. The Wolfville Campus houses Acadia University Archives and the Acadia University Art Gallery. Acadia offers over 200 degree combinations in the Faculties of Arts, Pure and Applied Science, Professional Studies, and Theology. The student-faculty ratio is 15:1 and the average class size is 28. Open Acadia offers correspondence and distance education courses.  Acadia began as an extension of Horton Academy (1828), which was founded in Horton, Nova Scotia, by Baptists from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838). The College was later named Acadia College. Acadia University, established at Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1838 has a strong Baptist religious affiliation. It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members. The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by denominational structures. King's College (University of King's College) was an Anglican school and Dalhousie University, which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the Church of Scotland. It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar, Edmund Crawley, to the Chair of Classics, as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a college established and run by the Baptists. In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for Queen Victoria). The college began with 21 students in January 1839. The name \"Queen's College\" was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed \"Acadia College\" in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an Acadian settlement. Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891, established by the Acadia University Act. The Granville Street Baptist Church (now First Baptist Church (Halifax)) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the university. It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development. Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president John Pryor, were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation. Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university. The original charter of the college stated: This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff. In 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces. Charles Osborne Wickenden (architect) and J.C. Dumaresq designed the Central Building, Acadia College, 1878–79. Clara Belle Marshall, from Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia, became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879. In 1891, there were changes in the Act of Incorporation. Andrew R. Cobb designed several campus buildings including: Raynor Hall Residence, 1916; Horton House, designed by Cobb in the Georgian style, and built by James Reid of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia was opened in 1915 as Horton Academy. Today, Horton Hall is the home of the Department of Psychology and Research and Graduate Studies. Emmerson Hall, built in 1913, is particularly interesting for the variety of building stones used. In 1967 Emmerson Hall was converted to classrooms and offices for the School of Education. It is a registered Heritage Property.

In a statement provided to The Chronicle Herald, Ivany wrote \"I came to Acadia in 2009 because I respected the institution’s history, the faculty and staff who had established its reputation, its alumni who care deeply about the university, and its students who, year after year, earn awards and recognition for their work. In my time here, I have discovered the same Acadia magic that attracts students from around the world\". , Peter J. Ricketts is the current president. Acadia University's Board of Governors and members of the Acadia University Faculty Association (AUFA) have ratified a new collective agreement news release covering the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2014. The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution. The first was 24 February to 12 March 2004. The second was 15 October to 5 November 2007. The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister, Mark Parent, appointed a mediator, on 1 November, to facilitate an agreement. In \"Maclean's\" 2019 Guide to Canadian Universities, Acadia was ranked 4th in the publication's \"primarily undergraduate\" Canadian university category. In the same year, the publication ranked Acadia 26th, in its overall national reputation rankings. Acadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure & Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology. Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research. The Division of Research & Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs. Acadia's research programs explore coastal environments, ethno-cultural diversity, social justice, environmental monitoring and climate change, organizational relationships, data mining, the impact of digital technologies, and lifestyle choices contributing to health and wellness. Acadia's research centres include the Tidal Energy Institute, the Acadia Institute for Data Analytics, and the Beaubassin Field Station. Applied research opportunities include research with local wineries and grape growers, alternative insect control techniques and technologies. In 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment. This academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching. By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative. The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond. Because of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History. It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award. In addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for Ubiquitous Computing. In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual \"Maclean's\" University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum. In October 2006, Dr. Dinter-Gottlieb established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception. The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere. The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability. Some of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model. The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996. The University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted. In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0. Acadia's sports teams are called the Axemen and Axewomen. They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of U Sports. School spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport. Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent. Expansion and modernization of Raymond Field was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the National Football League for its main playing field. The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province. War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams. In September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club and the Acadia Masters Swim Club to form the Acadia Swim Club and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus. On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009. Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: \"Stand Up and Cheer\", the Acadia University fight song. According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater - Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.' In 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the College of Arms in London, England. The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield. The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour. The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville. \"In pulvere vinces\" (In dust you conquer) is the motto. The University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena in front of the first college hall. The University also uses a stylized \"A\" as a logo for its sports teams. Notable among a number of fight songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: the Acadia University alma mater set to the tune of \"Annie Lisle\". The lyrics are: Seminary House, also known as the Ladies' Seminary, is a Second Empire style-building constructed in 1878 as a home for women attending the university. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 as Canada's oldest facility associated with the higher education of women. Carnegie Hall, built in 1909, is a large, two-storey, Neo-classical brick building. It was designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act in 1989 as its construction in 1909 signified Acadia's evolution from classical college to liberal university. The War Memorial House (more generally known as Barrax), which is a residence, and War Memorial Gymnasium are landmark buildings on the campus of Acadia University. The Memorial Hall and Gymnasium honours students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. Two granite shafts, which are part of the War Memorial Gymnasium complex at Acadia University, are dedicated to the university's war dead. The War Memorial House is dedicated to the war dead from Acadia University during the Second World War. At Acadia University, students have access to the Student Union Building which serves as a hub for students and houses many Student Union organizations. The building also houses The Axe Lounge, a convenience store, an information desk and two food outlets. The university press, The Athenaeum, is a member of CUP. All students are represented by the Acadia Students' Union.

N.d."], "neg": ["Acadians\nAcadians The Acadians (, ) are the descendants of French colonists who settled in Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries, some of whom are also descended from the Indigenous peoples of the region. The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada's Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), as well as part of Quebec, and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River. Although today most of the Acadians and Québécois are French-speaking (francophone) Canadians, Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France. It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada (modern-day Quebec). As a result, the Acadians and Québécois developed two distinct histories and cultures. They also developed a slightly different French language. France has one official language and to accomplish this they have an administration in charge of the language. Since the Acadians were separated from this council, their French language evolved independently, and Acadians retain several elements of 17th-century French that have been lost in France. The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from many areas in France, but especially regions such as Île-de-France, Normandy, Brittany, Poitou and Aquitaine. Acadian family names have come from many areas in France. For example, the Maillets are from Paris; the LeBlancs of Normandy; the surname Melançon is from Brittany, and those with the surnames Bastarache and Basque came from Aquitaine. During the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), British colonial officers suspected Acadians were aligned with France after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beausejour. Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War, the British, together with New England legislators and militia, carried out the Great Expulsion (Le Grand Dérangement) of the Acadians during the 1755–1764 period. They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region. Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning. The result was what one historian described as an ethnic cleansing of the Acadians from Maritime Canada. Other historians indicate that it was a deportation similar to other deportations of the time period. Most Acadians were deported to various American colonies, where many were forced into servitude, or marginal lifestyles. Some Acadians were sent to the Caribbean and some were deported to France. After being expelled to France, many Acadians were eventually recruited by the Spanish government to migrate to present day Louisiana state (known then as Spanish colonial \"Luisiana\"), where they developed what became known as Cajun culture. In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick because they were barred by the British from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia. Before the US Revolutionary War, the Crown settled New England Planters in former Acadian communities and farmland as well as Loyalists after the war (including nearly 3,000 Black Loyalists, who were freed slaves). British policy was to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled. Acadians speak a dialect of French called Acadian French. Many of those in the Moncton area speak Chiac and English. The Louisiana Cajun descendants speak a dialect of American English called Cajun English, with many also speaking Cajun French, a close relative of the original dialect from Canada influenced by Spanish and West African languages. During the early 1600s, about sixty French families were established in Acadia. They developed friendly relations with the Wabanaki Confederacy (particularly the Mi'kmaq), learning their hunting and fishing techniques. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; farming land reclaimed from the sea through diking. Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada (modern Quebec) and British territories, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War). While France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the Mí'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British. This was particularly evident in the early 1720s during Dummer's War but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726. The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755 preached against the 'English devils'. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia. With the founding of Halifax in 1749 the Mi'kmaq resisted British (Protestant) settlements by making numerous raids on Halifax, Dartmouth, Lawrencetown and Lunenburg. During the French and Indian War, the Mi'kmaq assisted the Acadians in resisting the British during the Expulsion of the Acadians. Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British. For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath, there were numerous reasons why they did not. The difficulty was partly religious, in that the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Church of England. Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime. A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq. As a result, signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in danger of attack from Mi'kmaq. In the Great Expulsion (\"le Grand Dérangement\"), after the Battle of Fort Beauséjour beginning in August 1755 under Lieutenant Governor Lawrence, approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes burned. The Acadians were deported throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies from New England to Georgia. Although measures were taken during the embarkation of the Acadians to the transport ship, some families became split up. After 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who went to Louisiana were transported there from France on five Spanish ships provided by the Spanish Crown to populate their Louisiana colony and provide farmers to supply New Orleans. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany and the effort was kept secret so as not to anger the French King. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, creating the Cajun population and culture. The Spanish forced the Acadians they had transported to settle along the Mississippi River, to block British expansion, rather than Western Louisiana where many of them had family and friends and where it was much easier to farm. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769 the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from Natchez to resettle on the Iberville or Amite river closer to New Orleans. A second and smaller expulsion occurred when the British took control of the North Shore of what is now New Brunswick. After the fall of Quebec the British lost interest and many Acadians returned to British North America, settling in coastal villages not occupied by American colonists. A few of these had evaded the British for several years but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now Fredericton, but were later displaced by the arrival of the United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution. In 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada issued a Royal Proclamation acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the \"Great Upheaval\" on some English-language calendars. The Acadians today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec, Louisiana and Maine. In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick, from Miscou Island () Île Lamèque including Caraquet in the center, all the way to Neguac in the southern part, Grande-Anse in the eastern part and Campbellton through to Saint-Quentin in the northern part. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the Magdalen Islands and throughout other parts of Quebec. Many Acadians still live in and around the area of Madawaska, Maine where the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia such as Chéticamp, Isle Madame, and Clare. East and West Pubnico, located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions still Acadian. The Acadians settled on the land before the deportation and returned to some of the same exact land after the deportation. Still others can be found in the southern and western regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these latter communities have faced varying degrees of assimilation. For many families in predominantly Anglophone communities, French-language attrition has occurred, particularly in younger generations. The Acadians who settled in Louisiana after 1764, known as Cajuns, have had a dominant cultural influence in many parishes, particularly in the southwestern area of the state known as Acadiana. Today Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Louisiana (Cajuns), and northern Maine. Since 1994, \"Le Congrès Mondial Acadien\" has united Acadians of the Maritimes, New England, and Louisiana. August 15, the feast of the Assumption, was adopted as the national feast day of the Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in Memramcook, New Brunswick in 1881. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having the \"tintamarre\" which consists mainly of a big parade where people can dress up with the colours of Acadia and make a lot of noise. The national anthem of the Acadians is \"\"Ave, maris stella\"\", adopted at Miscouche, Prince Edward Island in 1884. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Société Nationale de l'Acadie, where the second, third and fourth verses were changed to French, with the first and last kept in the original Latin. The Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Société Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as \"Acadian Remembrance Day\" to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger, disease and drowning in 1758. The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star. Today, there are cartoons featuring Acadian characters and an Acadian show named Acadieman. In 1847, American writer Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published \"Evangeline\", an epic poem loosely based on the events surrounding the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic, and contributed to a rebirth of Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana. In the early 20th century, two statues were made of Evangeline, one in St. Martinville, Louisiana and the other in Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia, which both commemorate the Expulsion. Robbie Robertson wrote a popular song based on the Acadian Expulsion titled Acadian Driftwood, which appeared on The Band's 1975 album, \"Northern Lights – Southern Cross\". Antonine Maillet's \"Pélagie-la-charette\" concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion. The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) honors those 3,000 who settled in Louisiana. Throughout the Canadian Maritime Provinces there are Acadian Monuments to the Expulsion, such as the one at Georges Island (Nova Scotia) and Beaubears Island. The flag of the Acadians is the French tricolour with a golden star in the blue field (see above), which symbolizes the Saint Mary, Our Lady of the Assumption, patron saint of the Acadians and the \"Star of the Sea\". This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island. Acadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the Acadiana region in 1974. A group of New England Acadians attending Le Congrès Mondial Acadien in Nova Scotia in 2004, endorsed a design for a New England Acadian flag by William Cork, and are advocating for its wider acceptance. Notable Acadians in the 18th century include Noël Doiron (1684–1758). Noel was one of more than 350 Acadians that perished on the Duke William on December 13, 1758. Noel was described by the Captain of the Duke William as the \"father of the whole island\", a reference to Noel's place of prominence among the Acadian residents of Isle St. Jean (Prince Edward Island). For his \"noble resignation\" and self-sacrifice aboard the Duke William, Noel was celebrated in popular print throughout the 19th century in Britain and America. Noel also is the namesake of the village Noel, Nova Scotia. Another prominent Acadian from the 18th century was militia leader Joseph Broussard who joined French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre in resisting the British occupation of Acadia. More recent notable Acadians include singers Angèle Arsenault and Edith Butler, singer Jean-François Breau, writer Antonine Maillet; film director Phil Comeau; singer-songwriter Julie Doiron; artist Phoebe Legere, boxers Yvon Durelle and Jacques LeBlanc; pitcher Rheal Cormier; former Governor General Roméo LeBlanc; former premier of Prince Edward Island Aubin-Edmond Arsenault, the first Acadian premier of any province and the first Acadian appointed to a provincial supreme court; Georges Hebert, guitarist - most notably having played with Anne Murray for over 30 years, as well as for the New Brunswick Playboys 1960s rock band; Aubin-Edmond Arsenault's father, Joseph-Octave Arsenault, the first Acadian appointed to the Canadian Senate from Prince Edward Island; Peter John Veniot, first Acadian Premier of New Brunswick; and former New Brunswick premier Louis Robichaud, who was responsible for modernizing education and the government of New Brunswick in the mid-20th century. Singers Beyoncé and Solange Knowles have Acadian ancestry.Yvette d'Entremont aka SciBabe is also Acadian. Prominent Louisiana Acadians include Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc, singer-songwriter Zachary Richard, and historian and President of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) William Arceneaux."]}

It entered service in 1965, replacing the earlier Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon. The GSh-23 works on the Gast Gun principle developed by German engineer Karl Gast of the Vorwerk company in 1916. It is a twin-barreled weapon in which the firing action of one barrel operates the mechanism of the other. It provides a much faster rate of fire for lower mechanical wear than a single-barrel weapon. Although it cannot match the sustained rate of fire of an electric Gatling gun like the M61 Vulcan GAU, because it doesn't need to spool up, its initial rate of fire is higher. It requires no external power source to operate, but is instead powered by the recoiling of the floating barrels, somewhat like the action of the German MG-42. The Gast principle has been little used in the West, but was popular in the former Soviet Union on a variety of weapons. It is reported to be a very reliable, robust weapon easily maintained in the field. The cannon comes in a basic GSh-23 variant, and the more popular GSh-23L (), differing mostly in adding a muzzle brake, lowering recoil force. This cannon was standard fit on late-model MiG-21 fighters (M, SM, MF, SMT, bis), all variants of the MiG-23, the SOKO J-22 Orao, the HAL Tejas and IAR 93, and the tail turrets of the Tupolev Tu-22M bomber and some late-model Tu-95s. In that application, it had the unusual ability to fire infrared flares and chaff rounds, allowing it to function as both a weapon and a dispenser of anti-missile countermeasures. It is also mounted on late small series Mi-24VP helicopters (in the NPPU-23 movable mounting) and Polish W-3WA Sokół helicopter in fixed mounting. The cannon was also used on cargo aircraft; specifically, Russian/Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft were designed to accommodate twin Gsh-23L's in a tail turret. An Il-76M with just such a configuration could be seen at the 2002 Ivanovo airshow. Some 2nd generation MiG-21 models could carry the GSh-23L in an under-fuselage gondola designated the GP-9, carrying the cannon and 200 rounds of ammunition; this was replaced by a more streamlined semi-conformal installation in later variants. There are also several gun pods available for mounting on external hardpoints: UPK-23 for air-to-air use, with one or two fixed GSh-23 guns and 200-400 rounds of ammunition, and SPPU-22 pods with traversable barrels for strafing, from 0° to −30° and carried 280 rounds of ammunition in each (they were most often carried by the Su-17/-20/-22 as well as the Su-25/-39 in pairs)."], "neg": ["SNCB Class 23\nSNCB Class 23 Class 23 locomotives were part of the 1950s generation of SNCB electric locomotives that included Types 122 (later 22), 123 (later 23), 125, (later 25 and 25.5) and 140 (later 25 and 25.5) built between 1953 and 1961. There were 50 Series 122, 83 Series 123, 16 Series 125 and 6 Series 140 for a total of 155. They were seen across Belgium on passenger and freight trains until they were retired in 2012. Class 23 was later fitted for multiple working, and were often found in pairs. There was no difference in power between the classes as they all used the same traction motors and control equipment. The 23s differed from the 22s in three ways. The most visible was the ventilation grilles. Those on the Type 122 were mounted on the roof and sometimes had problems with water ingestion. This was corrected by having three grilles mounted low on each side. Six of the 23s (2306-2313-2317-2320-2321-2331) later received an extra vent on one side only, just above the existing central one. The next was additional weight was added to the chassis to increase tractive effort. The third was the 23s had regenerative braking. The reason for these differences was to let them pull heavy freight trains on the line Brussels-Luxembourg. Loco 123.083 became 124.001 in 1968 and 2401 in 1971. It received a streamlined shroud at one end only that fit over the existing bodywork. It had its own windshield, wipers, washers and headlights. It also was given the ACEC Type G transmission system with a different gear ratio to test. Another change was that the traction motors were completely suspended rather than being just nose suspended. This was all a development stage for what was to have been a four voltage electric loco of 7000 HP. As time went on the four voltage requirement was dropped and the actual production locomotive became the Class 20, introduced late in 1975. 124.001/2401 made a number of test runs between Landegem and Aalter at speeds up to 200 km/h (124 mph). It was converted back to standard and renumbered to 2383 during 1974. It ran in regular freight and passenger services and became \"The Banker of Liège\" when it became the normal loco for pushing passenger trains up the steep ramp leading from Liège-Guillemins up to Ans. Loco 2302 was given ventilation grilles like those on Classes 11-12-21-27 as a test. These were mounted high on each side. The original openings were blanked in and each fitted with a porthole. No other Class 23s ever had these. 2302 retained this arrangement until the end of its service life. The arrival of the new Class 18 locomotives in early 2012 marked the end of the class, during the Spring of 2012 all were withdrawn except a few for banking duties at Liège-Guillemins but even those were soon withdrawn, replaced by Class 77 diesels. Before 1 January 1971 the locomotives were numbered 123.001-123.083 but from this date the class became 2301-2382. See the above history of 123.083 for detailed information on this loco. 2383 (ex 2401, 124.001, 123.083) is preserved by the SNCB.<ref>"]}

He was a leading expert on bees, his \"magnum opus\" being \"The Bees of the World\". Much of his career was devoted to the systematics and natural history of bees. His first peer-reviewed publication was in 1934, at the age of 16. He received his B.S. in 1939 and his Ph.D. in Entomology in 1941, from the University of California, Berkeley. He remained in California until 1942, when he became an Assistant Curator of Lepidoptera at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. In 1944 he published a classification system for bees that was soon adopted worldwide, and was in use until 1993 and 1995, when he co-authored new classifications. From 1943 to 1946, Michener also served as a First Lieutenant and Captain in the United States Army Sanitary Corps, where he researched insect-borne diseases, and described the life cycle of the common chigger.  Michener joined the faculty of the University of Kansas in 1948 as Associate Professor of Entomology. He was chairman of the Entomology Department from 1949 to 1961, and then again from 1972 to 1975. He was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 1955, and again in 1966. He was awarded the Watkins Distinguished Professor of Entomology in 1958, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965, and became Director of the Snow Entomological Museum (now part of the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, itself now a division within the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute) in 1974. In February 2001, the Association of American Publishers gave its prestigious R.R. Hawkins Award for the Outstanding Professional Reference or Scholarly Work of 2000 to Michener's opus, \"The Bees of the World\". Michener's work on social evolution in the Halictidae in the 1960s helped set the stage for the sociobiology revolution of the 1970s, with E. O. Wilson relying to a great degree on Michener's concepts regarding the paths from solitary to highly social life. Along with his research activities and teaching, Michener was the editor of the academic journals Evolution from 1962 to 1964, the associate editor of the Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics from 1970 to 1985, and the American editor of Insectes Sociaux from 1954 to 1955, again from 1970 to 1985. He served as President of the Kansas Entomological Society in 1950, President of the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1967, President of the Society of Systematic Zoology in 1968, and President of the American Society of Naturalists in 1978.

After Dance defined Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s, the definition changed with the evolution and progression of jazz music. What was mainstream then would not be considered mainstream now. In a general sense, Mainstream Jazz can be considered what was most popular at the time: For example, during the Swing era, swing and big band music were in their prime and what target audiences were looking for. Although Bebop was introduced into jazz during that time, audiences had not developed an ear for it.

An academic, writer and translator, Kennett was elected president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, serving for a short time before his early death. His 1696 \"Romæ Antiquæ Notitia, or the Antiquities of Rome\" was considered the subject's standard handbook for a century. Basil Kennett was born at Postling, Kent, on 21 October 1674, and was younger brother of White Kennett, bishop of Peterborough. He was educated under the care of his brother at a school at Bicester and in the family of Sir William Glynne at Ambrosden, Oxfordshire. In 1689 he entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, under the tuition of his brother, who was then vice-principal. According to \"Biographia Britannica\", \"he sat down to his studies with remarkable diligence ... so that he soon became distinguished both by his genius, and the extraordinary advances he made in classical and polite literature.\" In 1690 he was elected scholar of Corpus Christi College as a native of Kent, and graduated B.A. in 1693, M.A. in 1696. In the same year he published his \"Romæ Antiquæ Notitia or the Antiquities of Rome\", to which he prefixed two essays on the Roman Learning and Education. These essays were the first attempts of the kind made in any language at that time; and the book was so well received by the public, that he was thereby encouraged to prosecute his design of promoting and facilitating the study of classical learning. In that view he proceeded to draw up \"The Lives and Characters of the ancient Greek Poets\", which came out in 1697. The same year, on the 14th of February, he was admitted Fellow of Corpus Christi College, and became a tutor there. It was probably about this time, pursuant to the college-statutes, that he entered into Holy Orders: after which, directing the course of his studies in a more particular manner to Divinity, he published in 1705, \"An Exposition of the Apostles Creed, according to Bishop Pearson, in a new Method, by way of Paraphrase and Annotations\". This was followed in 1706 by \"An Essay towards a Paraphrase on the Psalms in Verse, with a Paraphrase on the third Chapter of the Revelations\". According to the Dictionary of National Biography, his learning and amiable qualities won him the regard of all parties. In the late 16th century Livorno - Leghorn - in Tuscany became an English Navy base for patrolling shipping routes in the Mediterranean Sea, thereby attracting a large English community to the city. According to Villani, \"The history of the British Factory of Leghorn is also the history of the conflicts that its members had with the Tuscan authorities to assert their right to live openly their religious beliefs. One of the questions that for a long time poisoned the relationships between the English and Tuscans in those years was the attempt made by the British Factory to obtain permission to celebrate Protestant religious services for its members. The religious authorities were against any concession — not because they were afraid of a possible Protestant proselytism, but because they feared the emergence of a spontaneous doctrine of tolerance among the Catholics.\" Against this context, and at the instigation of his brother White Kennett and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Basil Kennett was in 1706 appointed chaplain to the British factory at Leghorn, being the first to fill that office, and received the degree of B.D. by decree of convocation. The suggestion is made that he took up the post with some reluctance. He was at first much harassed by the Inquisition - the Roman Catholic Church's institutions dedicated against heresy - and had to seek the intervention of the English government, which promised military reprisals for any 'molestation given to her chaplain'. Ill-health, caused by the climate and his dislike of exercise, obliged him to resign, and he preached for the last time on 8 January 1712–13. He returned home by way of Florence, Rome, and Naples, and through France, collecting books, sculpture, and curiosities. He resumed residence at Corpus Christi in 1714, became D.D., and during the same year was elected president of his college, although he was ‘even then very sickly.’ He died of fever on 3 January 1714–15, and was buried in the college chapel. Kennett was author of:  Among the Lansdowne manuscripts are the following works by Kennett:  He translated from the French:  He also helped to translate Pufendorf's \"Of the Law of Nature and Nations\", fol. 1710 (1729 and 1749), and translated Horace's \"Art of Poetry\" (Brit. Mus. MS. Addit. 28726, f. 173). Hearne states, on the authority of James Tyrrell, that the third volume of White Kennett's \"History of England\", fol. 1706, was in reality the work of Basil Kennett.

He was 32 years old. He had he been sentenced to death on 10 September 1959 by the Deputy Bailiff of Jersey for the capital murder of John Perrée on the night of 30 March 1959, Easter Monday. John Perrée, a 45-year-old unmarried labourer from St Brelade, Jersey, was reported missing on March 31, 1959 after having spent the previous evening drinking with Francis Huchet. His body was recovered from a shallow grave on the sand dunes near Mont à la Brune (near St Brelade) on 4 April 1959. The body had been discovered by a young brother and sister, Alan and Ann Heath, who saw a shoe projecting from the sand. It became clear that Perrée had been shot in the face with a single blast from a shotgun. Once he had been identified, his movements were traced and this led to Huchet who was questioned on 5 April. Huchet admitted drinking with Perrée on the Monday night but told police that he had dropped him off at the traffic lights at Red Houses, after having gone with him to La Pulente Hotel. This was disputed by witnesses, including the landlord, John Callichan, who said that they had seen the two men leave the Horse and Hounds pub and drive off together in Huchet’s Hillman car. Police discovered a number of pieces of rope near the crime scene and these matched further pieces found in Huchet’s car. A woman’s coat and two pairs of jeans found at the scene were traced back to Huchet’s wife. Furthermore, tracks in the sand at the crime scene pointed to an attempt to free Huchet’s car after it had become bogged down in the dunes. From tyre tracks at the scene it appeared that the car had got stuck in sand and had had to be pulled out by another vehicle. When the murder weapon was discovered it contained traces of sand. Huchet was tried at St. Hellier from 7 to 10 September before the Deputy Bailiff, Cecil Harrison. 44 witnesses were called, and for the first time in a Jersey murder trial women sat on the 24-strong jury. Witnesses testified that Perrée had been carrying a wallet containing a considerable amount of money on the night of his death. Additionally, the jury were presented with damning forensic evidence which tied Huchet to the crime scene. Finally, Deputy Bailiff Harrison ruled that a bogus confession to the crime (written on the flyleaf of a book and smuggled out of Newgate Street Prison, where Huchet was being held) should be admitted into evidence. The bogus confession (which claimed that the murder had been committed by two men named Jim and Tom) had been accompanied by a covering note, written in Huchet's handwriting and addressed to a Mrs. Grace Kemp, which requested that the ‘confession’ be copied out in ink and forwarded anonymously to the police. Mrs. Kemp instead took the documents to the investigating officers; both items were subsequently shown to the jury, helping to seal Huchet’s fate. On 10 September 1959, after deliberating for 85 minutes, the 24 members of the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty. The guilty verdict immediately resulted in Huchet receiving a death sentence, because the law allowed for no other penalty. Huchet was hanged on the gallows at Newgate Street Prison, Saint Helier at 7.30 am on 9 October 1959. Harry Allen and two assistants (including Royston Rickard) carried out the execution in the presence of the prison governor, F.J. Moon, Deputy Keith Baal (president of the Prison Board) and other prison officers. An inquest was held at 8.30 am at the General Hospital, during which Dr P. G.

But Assamese consumption of products was tiny: most of the consumption would be in West Bengal and Bihar. So the government decided to pump Assamese crude to a refinery at Barauni, Bihar. However, Assamese students protested, and blockaded oil supply in 1980. A committee was appointed to suggest a new refining location within Assam. The students thought this would be near the oilfields. Instead the committee suggested Bongaigaon, far away from the oilfields and as close as possible to West Bengal, which would consume most of the products. This was a compromise between the politics and economics of refinery location. The refinery recently merged with the IOCL in 2009."]}

The unit engaged in both strategic bombing, close air support, anti-shipping and aerial interdiction operations. The majority of its operational life – not entirely unlike another Luftwaffe wing designated KG 40 — was spent on anti-shipping missions.

Attacking PQ 18, the group carried out a massed torpedo attack known as the Golden Comb, developed as an anti-convoy measure. Several ships were claimed sunk, but for the loss of 12 He 111s and seven crews. The unit had to be rebuilt owing to losses and was placed under the command of \"Luftflotte 5\" on 20 September 1942. II./KG 26 relocated to Sicily in January 1941 as part of Fliegerkorps X. After arriving, it lost six He 111s to an enemy air raid on 8 January 1941. On the night of 17/18 January 1941 12 He 111s were sent to bomb the Suez Canal. The range proved too great and I. Gruppe lost seven machines to fuel starvation. In the following weeks unsuccessful attacks were made on British warships in the Mediterranean. On 24 January it sank the freighter Sollum and minesweeper Huntley.  The unit also took part in missions over Malta, losing its first aircraft on 8 February 1941. During the Balkans Campaign the unit moved to Foggia in northern Italy and conducted raids against Yugoslavia as part of VIII. Fliegerkorps. 6.

III./KG 26 largely undertook Army support missions units 1942 when it operated various staffel as anti-shipping units in France and Norway. I./KG 26 left German occupied Norway in November 1942. The Gruppe was ordered to Grosseto to counter Operation Torch, the American landings in Morocco and Algeria on 8 November 1942. I./KG 26 attacked Allied shipping and lost 11 He 111s in November. On 22 December 1942, Ju 88s from III \"Gruppe\"', KG 26 torpedoed and damaged the British troopship \"Cameronia\". Strikes were made all alnong the African coast. Allied air attacks cost the unit four aircraft on 8 February 1943 when the units base at Cagliari-Elmas, Sardinia was bo mbed. In July 1943 the unit also contested Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 12 August the unit struck at Allied shipping in the western Mediterranean losing 10 machines for little result. On 8 September I./KG 26 attacked the Allied beaches at Salerno without success. In late August early September the unit moved to southern France at Salon-en-Provence. On 26 November 1943 the unit flew its last mission off North Africa. Until July 1944 I./KG 26 continued to fly anit-shipping missions off Anzio and western Italy. In July it relocated to Denmark to rearm with Junkers Ju 88A-4 aircraft. It formed a \"Einsatzstaffel\" which was ordered to pick up torpedoes from Flensburg for operations in the Crimea. However while en route, the unit ran into United States Army Air Force P-51 Mustangs and lost nine aircraft. I./KG 26 did convert onto the Ju 88, but owing to fuel shortages the unit was merged into I. and III./\"Kampfgeschwader 77\" in early June. II./KG 26 operated in the Crimea and Mediterranean over the same period. In April – September 1942 it undertook missions over the Kerch area. Among the ships attacked and sunk, the most notable success was a Soviet Submarine chaser, sunk on 6 July. An number of attacks were reported against Soviet Destroyers and Cruisers in August. The unit at this time was fragmented. 6 \"staffel\" (or 6.II./KG 26) operated under \"II. Fliegerkorps\", \"Luftflotte 2\" in the Crimea, while 5 \"staffel\" (5.II./KG 26) fought under \"Luftflotte 5\". In August 1942 6.II./KG 26 moved to Grosseto, Sicily. On 10 August 1942 it sank two freighters from the convoy \"Pedestal\". 6 \"staffel\" continued operations off North Africa until May 1944. Other units, such as 4 \"staffel\" remained based in the Crimea and attacked Soviet shipping during the German evacuation of the Crimea. Both 4 and 6 \"staffeln\" relocated to Germany to retrain on the FuG 200 anti-shipping radar in April 1944.  In June 1944 4, 5 and 6.II./KG 26 were located to France. These units were constantly moved, participating in attacks against the Allied landings in Southern France under Operation Anvil. II./KG 26 also attacked Allied Shipping in the English Channel and off the Isle of Wight at night after the Allied Normandy Landings. In August 1944 II./KG 26 retreated into Bavaria, Germany after the defeat in France. III./KG 26 operated in the Mediterranean, France and Norway during July 1942 – August 1944. Its most notable action was attacking Convoy PQ 18 in September 1942, whilst operating from Banak, Norway. III. Gruppe lost 8 He 111s on that mission. Missions continued against the Torch, Anzio and Normandy landings. By June 1944 III./KG 26 had suffered 50% losses and reduced missions to 3 or 4 per week of a few aircraft. In August 1944 it was withdrawn to Germany to rearm with the Ju 88A-3 in September – October 1944. In December the unit was relocated to Gardermoen, Norway. I./KG 26 was sent to Norway again after refitting in Denmark. It attacked several Allied convoys without result. On 10 January 1945 it was ordered to disband. Some pilots were sent to fighter units to retrain for Defense of the Reich duties. Other personnel were molded into Field Divisions in Denmark in February – March 1945. II./KG 26 relocated to Banak, Norway on 25 October 1944. It undertook anti-shipping missions against convoy JW/RA 64 south of Bear Island on 7–10 February 1945. It claimed 8 hits. The next day it claimed hits on 11 freighters, two Cruisers and two destroyers. The British however stated that no hits were made. On 23 February 1945 it flew its last combat mission sinking the Liberty ship . In May 1945 it began to rescue encircled German soldiers from the Courland pocket as the Red Army closed in. The Gruppe's last operation, on 9 May 1945, was approved by the Western Allies. III./KG 26 also assisted in these operations.

He was transferred to Haifa where he resigned his government position in 1942. On his resignation he returned to practising law in Jaffa. al-Hawari started his career as a devoted follower of Amin al-Husseini but broke with the influential Husseini family in the early 1940s. al-Hawari during the termination of the British mandate commanded \"al-Najjada\", a paramilitary scout movement. al-Hawari was in command of the militia in the defence of Jaffa until he fled in late December 1947. Morris comments that al-Hawari may also have been an Haganah Intelligence Service (HIS) informant. al-Hawari had met and did discuss an agreement for Jaffa with Ezra Danin.

Hawari was allowed to return to Israel and was later appointed judge in the district court of Nazareth. As well as his native Arabic al-Hawari was fluent in English and Hebrew. The first meeting of the General Refugee Congress (GRC) occurred on 17 March 1949 in Ramallah where al-Hawari was elected as President with Yahya Hammuda and ‘Aziz Shihada as deputies. The Palestine Conciliation Commission (PCC) hoping to gain a degree of independent Palestinian representation, invited Nimr to come and appear before the PCC. At informal meetings at the Lausanne peace talks during May 1949 al-Hawari as head of the Palestinian refugee delegation put forward to Eliahu Sasson a plan that Israel should accept 400,000 refugees being allowed to return to Israel. al-Hawari put forward the argument that the Arab states did not want the refugees, would not assimilate them and that masses of refugees living on the cease fire lines, stateless and impoverished would give Israel nothing but grief. In June 1949 al-Hawari contacted the Israeli Government suggesting an early solution to the refugee problem with 2 alternative plans; to create an independent Palestinian state or annex the West Bank to Israel. The failure of the attempt by al-Hawari, Yahya Hammuda, ‘Aziz Shihada, Sa’id Baidas and Francis Jelad to win a role for the independent refugee delegation at the Rhodes armistice talks in February 1949 and the subsequent Lausanne talks was an early demonstration of the inherent weakness of the Palestinian Arab people to replace the previous leadership structure destroyed by the collapse of the Palestinian society during the 1948 conflict. Although efforts were made to gain formal recognition of the GRC as a negotiating body and political representative of the Palestinian people. The Jordanian Government gradually marginalized the GRC until it withered away. Leaving Palestinian society fractured and fragmented. Egypt sought the aid of al-Hawari in early 1950 to strengthen the Mufti’s political position, al-Hawari did not comply. Hawari was involved with the first legal action against the state of Israel in 1951 on behalf of 5 men of Iqrit. Hawari acting as their lawyer was instrumental in gaining the right of return for the men of Iqrit. On 31 July 1951 the Israeli courts recognised the rights of the villagers to their land and their right to return to it.

Autienrieth renders the meaning of the name to be an adjective from πτόλεμος (\"ptólemos\"), explained as a Homeric Greek form of πόλεμος (\"pólemos\"), \"war\". A nephew of Antigonus I Monophthalmus was called \"Polemaeus\", the normal form of the adjective. \"Ptolemaios\" is first attested in Homer's Iliad and is the name of an Achaean warrior, son of Piraeus, father of Eurymedon. The name \"Ptolemaios\" varied over the years from its roots in ancient Greece, appearing in different languages in various forms and spellings. The original form, and some of the variants, are listed here in the languages relevant to the history of the name.  The name \"Ptolemy\" spread from its Greek origins to enter other languages in Western Asia during the Hellenisation that followed the conquest of the known world by Alexander the Great. The Aramaic name \"Bar Talmai\" (Greek \"Bartolomaios\" and English \"Bartholomew\") may be related. \"Ptolemais\" is formed from this name by the Greek feminine adjectival ending \"-i(d)s\".

It was known as the Huiyetou (穢邪頭) state in Shuowen Jiezi. It later became a vassal of the increasingly powerful Goguryeo. According to the Chinese Records of Three Kingdoms, Ye worshiped tigers, whereas according to \"Erya\", Maek means bears. Gomnaru, the capital of Baekje, also means the \"bear port\".

Founded in 1957 and developed as a planned community, the city grew to a population of 154,305 by the year 2010. The city's population estimate was 165,831 for 2013 and 179,804 for 2016. With an area of , Cape Coral is the largest city between Tampa and Miami. It is a principal city in the Cape Coral – Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population estimate for the statistical area was 679,513 for 2014. The city is known as a \"Waterfront Wonderland\"; with over of navigable waterways, Cape Coral has more miles of canals than any other city in the world. Cape Coral history began in 1957 when two brothers from Baltimore, Maryland, Leonard and Jack Rosen, flew over the peninsula known as Redfish Point, across the Caloosahatchee River near present-day Fort Myers. Cape Coral was founded as Redfish Point. Leonard and Jack Rosen, who were real-estate developers and a small group of partners, purchased a tract known as Redfish Point for $678,000 in that year and, in 1958, began development of the city as a master-planned, pre-planned community. The Gulf American Land Corporation (GALC), was formed to develop the area. GAC developed a marketing model that was a total departure from traditional selling methods. Approval was secured from the Lee County to master-plan the entire property into lots. Instead of listing the lots with real estate agents, GAC developed the land-sales, dinner-party model, operating from banquet rooms in local hotels. People were invited to attend by offering a free dinner for two. The model, referred to as team-selling, allowed for a well-trained team to close deals in 90 minutes. Buyers would sign a contract and agree to come to the property within six months and cancel if not satisfied. Ezio Valentini, an Italian real estate developer, joined GAC and became Director of Sales. The program was so successful that offices were opened in 24 states and an arrangement was made with an airline to charter flights to fly buyers to the property. Instead of borrowing from banks and lenders, the developers factored the sales contracts to pay for building the infrastructure. Canals were dug, streets paved, houses and businesses built. Cape Coral was promoted like no other Florida development. Celebrities were brought in to tout the benefits of \"the Cape\", as it is known locally. The first building in Cape Coral was the Rosens' sales office. It was built where George's Auto now stands, at Cape Coral and Coronado Pkwys. Cape Coral's first permanent resident was Kenny Schwartz, the Rosens' general manager. Cape Coral's first four homes were completed in May 1958, on Riverside and Flamingo Drives. Development continued through the early 1960s, mostly on Redfish Point, south of Cape Coral Parkway. By 1963, the population was 2,850; 1,300 buildings had been finished or were under construction; of road had been built, and of canals had been dug. The public yacht club, a golf course, medical clinic and shopping center were up and running. A major addition for Cape Coral was the construction of the 3,400 feet (1,000 m) long Cape Coral Bridge across the Caloosahatchee River, which opened in early 1964. Before the bridge, a trip to Fort Myers was more than via Del Prado Boulevard and over the Edison Bridge to cross the river.

Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states; because of this, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., New York City or Philadelphia). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Riverside–San Bernardino (Inland Empire) or Minneapolis–Saint Paul (Twin Cities)). MSAs are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and used by the Census Bureau and other federal government agencies for statistical purposes. U.S. Census statistics for metropolitan areas are reported according to the following definitions. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines a set of core based statistical areas (CBSAs) throughout the country. CBSAs are delineated on the basis of a central urban area or urban clusterin other words: a contiguous area of relatively high population density. CBSAs are composed of counties and county equivalents. The counties containing the core urban area are known as the \"central counties\" of the CBSA. A central county is a county in which 50% of its population lives in urban areas of at least 10,000 in population, or where a population of 5,000 are located in a single urban area of at least 10,000 in population where that urban area is split between more than one county. Additional surrounding counties, known as \"outlying counties\", can be included in the CBSA if these counties have strong social and economic ties to the central counties as measured by commuting and employment. Outlying counties are included in the CBSA if the employment interchange measure (total of in- and out-commuting) is 25% or more, although these numbers are estimates and exceptions are made. Some areas within these outlying counties may be rural in nature. All counties in a CBSA must be contiguous, and a county can only be included within one CBSA. In New England, towns have precedence over counties, so statistically similar areas are defined in terms of town-based units known as New England city and town areas (NECTAs). Adjacent CBSAs are merged into a single CBSA when the central county or counties of one CBSA qualify as an outlying county or counties to the other CBSAs. One or more CBSAs may be grouped together to form a larger statistical entity known as a combined statistical area (CSA) when the employment interchange measure reaches 15% or more. As well as MSAs, CBSAs are also subdivided into micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs) for CBSAs built around an \"urban cluster\" of at least 10,000 in population but less than 50,000 in population. Previous terms that are no longer used include \"standard metropolitan statistical area\" (SMSA) and \"primary metropolitan statistical area\" (PMSA).", "North Fort Myers, Florida\nNorth Fort Myers, Florida North Fort Myers is a census-designated place (CDP) in Lee County, Florida, United States.

After he was arrested in June 2003 for the attempted kidnapping of a girl in Ciney, Fourniret confessed to killing nine people—eight females and one male—in 2004, having been informed on by his then-wife, Monique Pierrette Olivier (born 31 October 1948). Fourniret was convicted of seven of these murders on 28 May 2008 and sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole, while Olivier was given life with a minimum term of 28 years for complicity. In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women. On 16 November 2018, Fourniret and Olivier were convicted of the murder of Farida Hammiche, the last of the eight females that Fourniret confessed to killing in 2004. Fourniret was given a second life sentence and Olivier was sentenced to a further twenty years' imprisonment. Fourniret has been imprisoned numerous times since the age of 24. While in prison he met his future (third) wife Monique Olivier. They married on 28 July 1989. Olivier was aware of Fourniret's activities and became his accomplice. They divorced in prison on 2 July 2010. Fourniret was arrested at his home in Sart-Custinne, Belgium, on 26 June 2003 after a failed attempt to kidnap a 13-year-old girl. He and Olivier were interrogated extensively but to no avail. A year later, Olivier told the police that her husband had killed a number of people since 1987. Fourniret confessed to killing eight females—aged between 12 and 30—and a man who has never been identified. The bodies of four of the identified victims had been discovered in France and Belgium between 1988 and 2002. Olivier was arrested and she and Fourniret and Olivier were extradited to France, where they helped police to find the bodies of three of the four missing victims over the next two years. The trial took place in Charleville-Mézières between 27 March and 28 May 2008. Fourniret was found guilty of the murders of all seven of the victims whose bodies had been found. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Olivier was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 28 years for complicity. Fourniret and Olivier were also ordered to pay 1.5 million euros in moral compensation to family members of the victims. Neither appealed their sentences. In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women. On 16 November 2018, Fourniret and Olivier were convicted of the murder of Farida Hammiche, the last of the eight females that Fourniret had confessed to killing in 2004. Fourniret was given a second life sentence and Olivier was sentenced to a further twenty years' imprisonment. Fourniret admitted to eight murders prior to his trial in 2008. He was convicted of seven of these and sentenced to life in prison. On 11 December 1987, Fourniret and Olivier drove, in separate vehicles, to Auxerre. Seeing 17-year-old Isabelle Laville – whom the couple had seen a day or two earlier and were targeting – walking home from school, Olivier stopped to ask her to join her in the car and give her directions, which Laville agreed to do. Driving down the road, Olivier reached the spot where Fourniret was standing with his car, pretending it had broken down. After she, as planned, pretended to offer him a lift, he got into her car. Fourniret choked Laville with a piece of rope, before Olivier sedated her with Rohypnol. The couple brought the girl to their home in Saint-Cyr-les-Colons, where Fourniret raped and strangled her. Laville's body was thrown down a disused well in Bussy-en-Othe. Her remains were recovered from the well on 11 July 2006. In March 1988, Fourniret was contacted by 30-year-old Farida Hammiche, the wife of Jean-Pierre Hellegouarch, an imprisoned bank robber with whom he had shared a cell prior to his release in October 1987, and asked to help unearth a loot from a cemetery in Fontenay-en-Parisis, which had been stolen by members of the \"Gang des postiches\". After they managed to retrieve the loot, which consisted of gold ingots and coins, Hammiche gave Fourniret a share worth 500,000 francs for helping her dig it up and hiding it in her apartment in Vitry-sur-Seine. A few weeks later, on 12 April, aiming to steal the rest of the loot, Fourniret and Olivier lured Hammiche out of her home and drove her to Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines, where she was strangled and her body buried, before the couple broke into her home and stole the loot. They used the money they made from it to buy a château called the Château du Sautou in Donchery. Hamiche's body was never found. By August, Olivier was heavily pregnant with Fourniret's baby. On 3 August, the couple drove to a supermarket in Châlons-sur-Marne (now Châlons-en-Champagne), and encountered 20-year-old Fabienne Leroy in the car park. With Olivier feigning illness, the couple asked Leroy to join them in their car and give them directions to a doctor's surgery. After she got in, they drove to a forest near the military camp of Mourmelon-le-Grand. Fourniret ordered Olivier to look at Leroy's hymen to see if it was still intact, but she refused. After raping Leroy, Fourniret shot her in the chest. In January 1989, Fourniret met 21-year-old Jeanne-Marie Desramault on the evening train to Charleville-Mézières. The two conversed before arriving in Charleville, where Desramault was staying at a convent. She met the couple, who had assumed false identities, at the train station again on Saturday, 18 March, and they invited her to come to their house in Floing – an offer she accepted – and Fourniret promised he would drive her home afterwards. After they got to Floing, Fourniret asked Desramault if she was a virgin, and she told him she wasn't and had a boyfriend. Enraged, he attacked her. She fought back as he attempted to rape her, and as she attempted to escape, the couple gagged her with adhesive bandages before Fourniret strangled her. Fourniret and Olivier drove to Donchery and buried her body in the garden of the Château du Sautou. Fourniret and Olivier married in July 1989. On the afternoon of 20 December, they drove across the Franco-Belgian border to Saint-Servais, Namur, with their one-year-old son. Fourniret saw 12-year-old Elisabeth Brichet walk to a friend's house, and waited outside for her until she left to walk the short distance home just before 7 pm. He asked her to give him directions to a doctor's surgery for his son. She agreed to do so, and the couple drove back to Floing with her. When Fourniret undressed the girl, he saw that she was on her period, so Olivier cleaned Brichet's genitals. The next day, the couple took her to the château, where Fourniret strangled her after a failed attempted to suffocate her with a plastic bag. Her body was buried in the garden of the château, near to that of Jeanne-Marie Desramault. There were a number of reported sightings of Brichet, in Belgium and abroad, in the years following her disappearance, and a number of people were suspected by police of abducting her, including Marc Dutroux. After Dutroux's arrest in 1996, Brichet's mother Marie-Noëlle Bouzet helped to organise the White March in honour of Belgium's missing and murdered children. The remains of Brichet and Desramault were exhumed from the gardens of the Château du Sautou on 3 July 2004, after Fourniret and Olivier confessed to the killings. The final known murder Fourniret committed with Olivier's help took place on 21 November 1990 near France's western coast. The couple drove to a shopping centre in Rezé after leaving court in Nantes, where they had been convicted of burglary. They saw Natacha Danais, a 13-year-old local, walking through the car park towards her home, having been sent to fetch her mother's forgotten purse. They lured her into the van, asking her for directions. After driving to a secluded area near the coast, Fourniret stabbed Danais twice in the chest with a screwdriver and strangled her before leaving her body on the beach. Later investigation suggested that the girl's body was raped after the murder. Eight days after Danais's death, Jean Groix, a neighbour of her family, was arrested after a white van belonging to him matched the description of the van that her sister had vaguely seen her get into from across the shopping centre's car park at the time she disappeared. Groix was found to be lodging suspected members of the ETA in his home; police suspected that Danais had found out about this. Two months later, Groix committed suicide in his prison cell. He was reported to have been unable to bear the burden of having been accused of murder. The Fourniret family moved to Sart-Custinne, Gedinne, Belgium, in the early 1990s. Michel Fourniret admitted that he committed two more murders in France between 2000 and 2001, after a ten-year break. He drove alone across the Franco-Belgian border to Charleville-Mézières on 16 May 2000 and accosted 18-year-old Céline Saison, who was on her way home from school, in the late afternoon. Driving with her back to Belgium, he blackmailed her into having sex with him before strangling her with a rope and dumping her body in a forest in Sugny, Vresse-sur-Semois. Saison's skeletal remains were discovered there by mushroom pickers on 22 July. On 5 May 2001, Fourniret drove back to France – this time to his birthplace of Sedan – and met Mananya Thumpong, a 13-year-old girl of Thai origin whom he had met and given a lift home a few weeks earlier, outside the local library. He invited her to come to his house and play with his son. Accepting this offer, Thumpong climbed into the car and was driven to Nollevaux, Paliseul, where Fourniret strangled her. Her body lay undiscovered for months in a nearby forest as it was devoured almost entirely by wild animals. Thumpong's remaining bones were found on 1 March 2002. In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women in Auxerre: Marie-Angèle Domèce, an 18-year-old disabled woman, in July 1988, and Joanna Parrish, a 20-year-old British student, in May 1990.  Two French journalists have suggested that Fourniret killed former Minister for Labour Robert Boulin (who was involved in a real estate scandal at the time), based on a letter Fourniret wrote to Olivier. Christian Ranucci was one of the last persons executed in France, having been convicted of the abduction and murder, committed on 3 June 1974, of Marie-Dolorès Rambla, aged eight. There are suspicions that Ranucci may not actually have been the killer (although he confessed, his confession was later retracted). It has been suggested that Fourniret may have been involved as Fourniret was in the area at the time and had practically the same car as Ranucci. Analysis of photographs, however, suggest that the man in photographs produced as evidence could not have been Fourniret. Fourniret was also named the \"Virgin hunter\". Although it is unclear where this nickname came from, it is alleged that Olivier promised Fourniret to help hunt \"virgins\" for sport, in return for Fourniret helping Olivier to murder her first husband (which never took place). The rape of women assumed to be virgins, is a recurring theme in the way Fourniret operated, something which he considered \"sport\". Rachida Dati the then French Minister for Justice, who advocated legal reforms in France, wanted a more relaxed attitude to preventative custody and parole under supervision. She was heavily criticised by the judiciary. The question was asked how Fourniret, who was a known criminal, could have carried on for such a long time without being noticed and how the changes in the law would have a positive influence on cases like these."], "neg": ["Sofitel massacre\nSofitel massacre On the night of 4-5 August 1983 at 3:30 am, a gunman entered a luxury Sofitel hotel in Avignon, France, and killed seven people there in a mass shooting which has been referred to as the Sofitel massacre. Four of the deaths were employees and three were customers. Police believed the suspects were three robbers who attempted to break into the hotel's safe deposit boxes, and that they killed the victims to eliminate any witnesses. The robbers also took some staff members hostage, apparently to search for a master key of the boxes. The French government was criticised by hotel and restaurant unions as well as police unions, demanding tougher action against crime. In addition it happened after the government abolished the death penalty for murders and in another move made it easier for long-term prisoners to win parole. Jean Roussel, a 38-year-old robber, was arrested soon after whilst the other suspects escaped. Roussel barely spoke amid the investigation and he died from a heart attack in 1985. In June 1987, François Arpinot, a scrap dealer, and Gérard Rolland, a nightclub bouncer, were sentenced to 18 and 15 years in prison respectively. It was implied that Roussel launched the robbery to finance his escape, as he was already detained in another case but granted leave."]}

It is an institution of higher education that trains specialists in many fields of knowledge and carries out research. It is considered the most prestigious university in Ukraine and a major centre of advanced learning and progressive thinking. It consists of more faculties and departments, and trains specialists in a greater number of academic fields, than any other Ukrainian educational institution. Nowadays, as it has done throughout its history, the University retains its role of a major center of learning and research as well as an important cultural center. Its academics and students follow the long-standing traditions of the highest academic standards and democratic ideals. At present, the student body of Taras Shevchenko University totals about <30,000 students <a href=\"https%3A//www.topuniversities.com/universities/taras-shevchenko-national-university-kyiv\"></a>; this number includes almost 2,000 students at the Institute of International Relations which is attached to Taras Shevchenko University. As training highly qualified specialists has always been the main goal, the faculties and departments constantly revise their curricula and introduce new programs. A number of faculties offer 4-year Bachelor's and 2-year master's degree programs, together with traditional 5-year Specialist Degree programs. Currently, the stress is on student's ability to work independently and meet employer's requirements, thus practical experience in the field being of foremost importance. The curricula of all Taras Shevchenko University faculties are based on the combination of academic instruction with student's research work and the combination of thorough theoretical knowledge with specific skills. Having acquired theoretical knowledge in the first and the second year, in their third year undergraduates choose an area to specialize in. At the same time they choose a field for their independent study, joining elective special seminars; the results of research are usually presented at the meetings of students' scientific societies or at scientific conferences, the most interesting results are published.  The University was founded in 1834, when the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia (r. 1825-1855) signed the Charter about the creation of the University named after Saint Vladimir, the ruler who Christianized the Kievan Rus'. This name was chosen by the authorities of the Russian Empire, where the role of Orthodox Christianity was immense, and may have reflected the ongoing importance of Kiev as the cradle of Eastern Christianity for the entire Empire. The university benefited from assets transferred from Vilnius University, which was closed in the aftermath of the November Uprising of 1831. The first 62 students started their studies at the university in 1834, in its one faculty, the Faculty of Philosophy, which had two Departments: The Department of History and Philology and The Department of Physics and Mathematics. There were new additions to the original department in 1835 and 1847: the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine. Later on, the original Faculty of Philosophy was divided into two separate units: the Faculty of History and Philology and the Faculty of Natural Sciences. There were no more additions to the number of departments until the 1920s. The walls of the main building are painted in red while the tops and bottoms of its columns are painted black. Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych's Shchedryk was premiered at the Kyiv University on December 26, 1916 by the university's choir directed by Oleksandr Koshyts. In 1920, Saint Vladimir University was renamed as Mykhailo Drahomanov University. In 1939, Saint Vladimir University was renamed after Taras Shevchenko (upon graduation from the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Empire, Taras Shevchenko returned to Kiev, and between 1845–1846, was employed by the Archaeological and Ethnographic Commission at the University until his arrest in 1847). Since 1960, when the first international students were admitted, over 20,000 highly qualified specialists have been trained at Taras Shevchenko University for 120 countries. The first foreign students of the Taras Shevchenko University came from Cuba, Guinea, Indonesia, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Benin, Zanzibar, Yemen, Algeria, and Afghanistan. They continued on to become doctors, engineers, agriculturists, diplomats, economists, and statesmen in their respective countries. During the Soviet period, the Taras Shevchenko University received one Order of Lenin (1959) and one Order of the October Revolution (1984). Additionally, in 2002 the asteroid 4868 Knushevia was named in honour of Kyiv Taras Shevchenko University. In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016-2017 Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (KNU) is ranked within top 500 Universities in the world. In 2009, \"Delovoy\" magazine ranked Taras Shevchenko University as the best university in Ukraine, being nationally the strongest in the greatest number of academic fields. According to the independent ranking of 228 universities in Ukraine performed by \"Compas\", Taras Shevchenko University was ranked the first best position in Ukraine regarding the adequacy of alumni to the labor market of Ukraine.  According to Scopus (2009), Taras Shevchenko University has the highest research paper output of any Ukrainian university, and is also the top research producer (as assessed by total paper citation count). The university features in the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities (2010) at 1,346 out of 8,000 in the world, at 63 out of top 100 universities of the Central and Eastern Europe, and a leading academic institution in Ukraine. The University has over 400 partner universities, currently maintains relations and, in some cases, student exchange programs with universities of forty countries; a figure which includes a number of former republics of the Soviet Union and other countries which Ukraine traditionally, over the past 70 years prior to independence in 1991, did not have official bilateral relations with.

These are the 14 faculties and 6 institutes into which the university is divided:  After its initial establishment the university was located in private rooms in Pechersk, and was named for St. Vladimir. Now the main building (built 1837-42 by architect V I Beretti) can be found at 60 Vladimirska Street, whilst a number of humanities departments are located at 14 Shevchenko Boulevard 14 (formerly the First Kyiv Gymnasium). Furthermore, there are departments located on Glushkov Street (building 6, built 1954-70) and Vasylkivska Street (Library is located in building No. 90, built in 1939). The university's administration is housed in buildings 58-64 on Vladimirska Street. It was constructed from 1837–1843 and was built in the late Russian Classicism style, by a Russian architect of Italian descent, Vincent I. Beretti. The building forms an enormous square enclosing a courtyard; the length of the main façade is 145.68m. The walls of the building are painted blood red and the capitals and bases of the portico's columns are painted black, corresponding to the colours of the ribbon of the Order of St. Vladimir (founded in 1782), as Kyiv University used to bear the name of this Order. The motto of the Order, \"Benefit, honor and glory\" \"(Pol'za Chest' i Slava)\" also, subsequently, became the motto of Kyiv University. Local tour guides sometime state that Tsar Nicholas I ordered the entire main building painted red in response to student conscription protests during World War I to remind students of blood spilled by Ukrainian soldiers. The legend does not reflect the historical fact, as the building was before World War I, in 1842. Nicholas I of Russia (1825–1855) died long before World War I (1914–1918). Built at the top of a hill, this building has significantly influenced Kiev's architectural layout in the 19th century. The university's A.V. Fomin Botanical Garden (named after Academician Aleksandr V. Fomin, 1869–1935) was founded in 1839 and planned by architect V. Beretti and botanist R. E. Trautfetterom. The total area covered by the garden is around 5.22 hectares; it has a collection of over 10 000 species, forms and varieties of plants. The garden's greenhouse's height, after reconstruction in 1977, is about 33 meters and is the largest in the world. The university's first orangerie was built in 1846-49 for its collection of tropical and subtropical plants; a collection which has now over two thousand items and is one of the largest in Europe. The gardens are located at the city centre campus, to the rear of the red building; the nearest metro station is Universytet. The Humanities Building or 'Yellow' building of the university is located at 14 Shevchenko boulevard, built in 1850-52 it was designed in the classical style by the architect Alexander Vikentiyovych Beretti (1816–95), son of V. Beretti, the architect of by the main (red) building. The building initially belonged to the First Gymnasium (a grammar school, in which taught M. Berlin and M. Kostomarov, and students of which include: artists Nikolai Ge and V.Levandovskyy, M. Zakrevskii historian, economist M. Bunge, poet M.Herbel, sculptor P. Isabella, writers Bulgakov and K. Paustovsky and future academics E. Tarle and O. Bogomolets, A. Lunacharsky). In 1919 the academic Vernadsky, first president of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, took up residence in part of the building. Since 1959, the building has been part of the Kyiv National University. The Maksymovych Library (58 Vladimirska Street), built in 1939-40, is a neo-classical building designed by architects VA Osmaka and P. Alyoshin as the university's Humanities building. Currently the library holds around 3.5 million books, making it currently the largest research library in Ukraine. Along with the No.1 branch of the National Library of Ukraine (62 Vladimirska Street), which was designed by the same architects in the 1929–30, and the main (red) building of the university, the Maksymovych library forms an important and impressive architectural ensemble which is today considered to be one of Kiev's key collective architectural monuments. In the 1960s it became imperative that the Kyiv National University acquire more space for its greatly expanded number of departments. It was with this in mind that the building of a complex of new buildings for the university started on the southwestern outskirts of Kiev (opposite the National Exhibition Centre of Ukraine). The authors of the final project were architects V E Ladnyi, M P Budylovskyi, V E Kolomiets and engineer V Y Drizo.  The Institute of International Relations and Institute of Journalism's joint building at 36 Melnikova Street, developed by Kyivproect architects O Nosenko, I Shpara, Yu Duhovichny, O Klishchuk and Y Vig, was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine in the field of architecture in 1995. The astronomical observatory of Kyiv National University is located at 3 Observatorna Street; founded in 1845, it was initially planned to place an observatory in the Main Building of the university (as evidenced by existing architectural designs for the red building), however, it was later decided to build for a separate building to house the observatory.

After the breakdown of the Soviet Union, it became the main (and only) military school in Ukraine, preparing engineering and logistics officers for the Ukrainian Air Force. All educational programs had five-year duration and graduates were granted a qualification and a degree of military engineer (corresponding to the western level from Bachelor to Master of Engineering). The same educational programs were used at the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. It was founded on September 1, 1951 as the Kiev Higher Engineering Radio-Technical College of the Soviet Air Force. The academy had a very high reputation; competition for admission was 15 applicants per place. It had academic councils which were awarding Doktor nauk and Candidate of Sciences (Ph.D) degrees. The academy had two locations. The main academic campus was located at 30 Vozdukhoflotskii Avenue in a massive three-story building built in the 1910s, and a second building on Hryhoriia Andriuschenka Street. In addition, the academy had a training airfield near the Kiev Zhuliany Airport. About a dozen planes and helicopters of various types were available there for engineering practice. The flights were not performed. Later, the training airfield was used to establish the Ukraine State Aviation Museum. On July 3, 2000, the military institution has ceased to exist as such, has been reorganized, the staff and students were relocated to the at Kharkiv. The main academic building now houses the Ivan Chernyakhovsky National Defense University of Ukraine. The faculties #1 and #2 admitted officers who previously completed training at the three-year technical military colleges and had experience of service in the Air Force. The faculties of Aviation Equipment and Avionics accepted high school graduates.  Balenko, Alexander A.

{"query": "Robert Brown botanical expeditions instead of plant descriptions", "pos": ["Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)\nRobert Brown (botanist, born 1773) Robert Brown FRSE FRS FLS MWS (21 December 1773 – 10 June 1858) was a Scottish botanist and palaeobotanist who made important contributions to botany largely through his pioneering use of the microscope. His contributions include one of the earliest detailed descriptions of the cell nucleus and cytoplasmic streaming; the observation of Brownian motion; early work on plant pollination and fertilisation, including being the first to recognise the fundamental difference between gymnosperms and angiosperms; and some of the earliest studies in palynology. He also made numerous contributions to plant taxonomy, including the erection of a number of plant families that are still accepted today; and numerous Australian plant genera and species, the fruit of his exploration of that continent with Matthew Flinders. Brown was born in Montrose on 21 December 1773. He was the son of James Brown, a minister in the Scottish Episcopal Church with Jacobite convictions so strong that in 1788 he defied his church's decision to give allegiance to George III. His mother was Helen Brown \"née\" Taylor, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. As a child Brown attended the local Grammar School (now called Montrose Academy), then Marischal College at Aberdeen, but withdrew in his fourth year when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1790. His father died late the following year. Brown enrolled to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but developed an interest in botany, and ended up spending more of his time on the latter than the former. He attended the lectures of John Walker; made botanical expeditions into the Scottish Highlands, alone or with nurserymen such as George Don; and wrote out meticulous botanical descriptions of the plants he collected. He also began corresponding with and collecting for William Withering, one of the foremost British botanists of his day. Highlights for Brown during this period include his discovery of a new species of grass, \"Alopecurus alpinus\"; and his first botanical paper, \"\", read to the Edinburgh Natural History Society in January 1792, but not published in print in Brown's lifetime. Brown dropped out of his medical course in 1793. Late in 1794, he enlisted in the Fifeshire Fencibles, and his regiment was posted to Ireland shortly after. In June 1795 he was appointed Surgeon's Mate. His regiment saw very little action, however, he had a good deal of leisure time, almost all of which he spent on botany. He was frustrated by his itinerant lifestyle, which prevented him from building his personal library and specimen collection as he would have liked, and cut him off from the most important herbaria and libraries. During this period Brown was especially interested in cryptogams, and these would be the subject of Brown's first, albeit unattributed, publication. Brown began a correspondence with James Dickson, and by 1796 was sending him specimens and descriptions of mosses. Dickson incorporated Brown's descriptions into his \"Fasciculi plantarum cryptogamicarum britanniae\", with Brown's permission but without any attribution. By 1800, Brown was firmly established amongst Irish botanists, and was corresponding with a number of British and foreign botanists, including Withering, Dickson, James Edward Smith and José Correia da Serra. He had been nominated to the Linnean Society of London; had contributed to Dickson's \"Fasciculi\"; was acknowledged in a number of other works; and had had a species of algae, \"Conferva brownii\" (now \"Aegagropila linnaei\") named after him by Lewis Weston Dillwyn. He had also begun experimenting with microscopy. However, as an army surgeon stationed in Ireland there seemed little prospect of him attracting the notice of those who could offer him a career in botany. In 1798, Brown heard that Mungo Park had withdrawn from a proposed expedition into the interior of New Holland (now Australia), leaving a vacancy for a naturalist. At Brown's request, Correia wrote to Sir Joseph Banks, suggesting Brown as a suitable replacement: He was not selected, and the expedition did not end up going ahead as originally proposed, though George Caley was sent to New South Wales as a botanical collector for Banks. In 1800, however, Matthew Flinders put to Banks a proposal for an expedition that would answer the question whether New Holland was one island or several. Banks approved Flinders' proposal, and in December 1800 wrote to Brown offering him the position of naturalist to the expedition. Brown accepted immediately. Brown was told to expect to sail at the end of 1800, only a few weeks after being offered the position. A succession of delays meant the voyage did not get under way until July 1801. Brown spent much of the meantime preparing for the voyage by studying Banks' Australian plant specimens and copying out notes and descriptions for use on the voyage. Though Brown's brief was collect scientific specimens of all sorts, he was told to give priority to plants, insects, and birds, and to treat other fields, such as geology, as secondary pursuits. In addition to Brown, the scientific staff comprised the renowned botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer; the gardener Peter Good, whose task was to collect live plants and viable seed for the use of Kew Gardens; the miner John Allen, appointed as mineralogist; the landscape artist William Westall; and the astronomer John Crosley, who would fall ill on the voyage out and leave the ship at the Cape of Good Hope, being belatedly replaced at Sydney by James Inman. Brown was given authority over Bauer and Good, both of whom were instructed to give any specimens they might collect to Brown, rather than forming separate collections. Both men would provide enthusiastic and hard-working companions for Brown, and thus Brown's specimen collections contain material collected by all three men. \"Investigator\" sailed from London on 18 July. They made brief landfalls at Bugio Island (Desertas Islands) and Madeira, but Brown was disappointed to collect almost nothing of note from either site. They arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 October, staying a little over two weeks, during which time Brown made extensive botanical expeditions, and climbed Table Mountain at least twice. Many years later he would write to William Henry Harvey, who was considering emigrating there, that \"some of the pleasantest botanizing he ever had was on Devil's Mountain, near Cape Town, and he thought I could not pitch on a more delightful field of study.\" Amongst the plants collected at the Cape were two new species of \"Serruria\" (Proteaceae), \"S. foeniculacea\" and \"S. flagellaris\".  arrived in King George Sound in what is now Western Australia in December 1801. For three and a half years Brown did intensive botanic research in Australia, collecting about 3400 species, of which about 2000 were previously unknown. A large part of this collection was lost when was wrecked \"en route\" to England. Brown remained in Australia until May 1805. He then returned to Britain where he spent the next five years working on the material he had gathered. He published numerous species descriptions; in Western Australia alone he is the author of nearly 1200 species. The list of major Australian genera that he named includes: Livistona, Triodia, Eriachne, Caladenia, Isolepis, Prasophyllum, Pterostylis, Patersonia, Conostylis, Thysanotus, Pityrodia, Hemigenia, Lechenaultia, Eremophila, Logania, Dryandra, Isopogon, Grevillea, Petrophile, Telopea, Leptomeria, Jacksonia, Leucopogon, Stenopetalum, Ptilotus, Sclerolaena and Rhagodia. In early 1809 he read his paper called \"On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae\" to the Linnean Society of London. This was subsequently published in March 1810 as \"On the Proteaceae of Jussieu\". It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics. This work was extensively plagiarised by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who had memorised much of the Linnean reading and then inserted it in Joseph Knight's 1809 publication \"On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae\". In 1810, he published the results of his collecting in his famous \"Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen\", the first systematic account of the Australian flora. That year, he succeeded Jonas C. Dryander as Sir Joseph Banks' librarian, and on Banks' death in 1820 Brown inherited his library and herbarium. This was transferred to the British Museum in 1827, and Brown was appointed Keeper of the Banksian Botanical Collection. In 1818 he published \"Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, in the vicinity of the Congo\". In 1822, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1827 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, three years later he became associated member. When the institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 Brown joined as foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. In a paper read to the Linnean society in 1831 and published in 1833, Brown named the cell nucleus. The nucleus had been observed before, perhaps as early as 1682 by the Dutch microscopist Leeuwenhoek, and Franz Bauer had noted and drawn it as a regular feature of plant cells in 1802, but it was Brown who gave it the name it bears to this day (while giving credit to Bauer's drawings). Neither Bauer nor Brown thought the nucleus to be universal, and Brown thought it to be primarily confined to Monocotyledons. After the division of the Natural History Department of the British Museum into three sections in 1837, Robert Brown became the first Keeper of the Botanical Department, remaining so until his death. He was succeeded by John Joseph Bennett. He served as President of the Linnean Society from 1849 to 1853. Brown died at 17 Dean Street, Soho Square in London, on 10 June 1858. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Brown's name is commemorated in the Australia herb genus \"Brunonia\" as well as numerous Australian species such as \"Eucalyptus brownii\", \"Banksia brownii\" and the moss Brown's Tetrodontium Moss (\"Tetrodontium brownianum\"), a species which he discovered growing at Roslin near Edinburgh whilst still a student. The plant can still be found at the site of its discovery.  Passing through the suburb of Kingston, south of Hobart, Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen's Land, is Brown's River, named in his honor, upon the banks of which, he collected botanical samples. In South Australia, Mount Brown and Point Brown (near Smoky Bay) were named for him by Flinders during the \"Investigator\" expedition. Mount Brown in British Columbia, Canada is named for him. In 1938 the London County Council commemorated Brown, as well as botanists Joseph Banks and David Don, and meetings of the Linnean Society, with a rectangular stone plaque at 32 Soho Square. In 1827, while examining grains of pollen of the plant \"Clarkia pulchella\" suspended in water under a microscope, Brown observed minute particles, now known to be amyloplasts (starch organelles) and spherosomes (lipid organelles), ejected from the pollen grains, executing a continuous jittery motion. He then observed the same motion in particles of inorganic matter, enabling him to rule out the hypothesis that the effect was life-related. Although Brown did not provide a theory to explain the motion, and Jan Ingenhousz already had reported a similar effect using charcoal particles, in German and French publications of 1784 and 1785, the phenomenon is now known as Brownian motion. In recent years controversy arose over whether Brown's microscopes were insufficient to reveal phenomena of this order. Brown's re-discoveries were denied in a brief paper in 1991. Shortly thereafter, in an illustrated presentation, British microscopist Brian J. Ford presented to Inter Micro 1991 in Chicago a reprise of the demonstration using Brown's original microscope. His video sequences substantiated Brown's observations, suggesting Brown's microscope was sufficient to allow him to see motion. Physicist Phil Pearle and colleagues presented a detailed discussion of Brown's original observations of particles from pollen of \"Clarkia pulchella\" undergoing Brownian motion, including the relevant history, botany, microscopy, and physics.

Brown was born in Camster, Caithness, and studied in the universities of Edinburgh, Leyden, Copenhagen, and Rostock. He took the habit of referring to his home town, Campster (\"Campsterianus\"), to distinguish himself from his famous contemporary of the same name: Robert Brown of Montrose.  He visited Spitzbergen, Greenland, and the western shore of Baffin Bay while still an undergraduate, and subsequently carried on scientific investigations among the islands of the Pacific and on the Venezuelan, Alaskan, and Bering shores, leading an expedition to map the interior of Vancouver Island and writing much on the fauna and flora of those countries. Brown arrived at Fort Victoria in early 1863 to explore the Colony of Vancouver Island. Later that year, he explored from Barkley Sound to Kyuquot. The following year he accepted the leadership of the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition, a venture which covered about 2000 km over four and a half months. The expedition named many of the mountains, rivers and lakes of Vancouver Island.; members of expedition, which included Frederick Whymper as its artist, insisted that Browns River be named after him. They found gold at the Leech River, causing much excitement, but the results were limited to $60,000. Brown attributed more importance to their discovery of coal in the Comox Valley.. He took an interest in Chinook jargon. With Edward Whymper, brother of Frederick, he attempted to penetrate the inland ice of Greenland in 1867, and made many discoveries concerning its nature which were later confirmed by Robert Peary. He traveled in the Barbary States of North Africa, and became the foremost British authority on Morocco almost by accident, having gone there for a holiday but having found himself unable to enjoy idleness. Before he was 30 years old Brown had written over 30 academic papers and an advanced textbook on botany, in addition to more popularising works. He wrote up his Vancouver Island travels and was awarded a doctorate based on this by the University of Rostock in 1869. He was a lecturer on geology, botany, and zoology in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and was a member of many learned societies in England, America, and on the Continent. He was president of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, and a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society. Brown moved to London in 1876 and spent the rest of his life writing, earning his living as a journalist. In addition to botany, he also wrote prolifically on zoology, geology, and geography, for both learned and popular audiences. One example of this ability to write for generalists and specialists is the extensive commentary he contributed to an 1896 reprint of the 1807 slave narrative of John R. Jewitt, in which Brown reflects on the changes in the lives of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast from the time of the first European explorers in the late eighteenth century, to Maquinna's chiefdom and Jewitt's captivity, to his own explorations in 1863, when intertribal warfare was still rife, to the situation in the mid-1890s, by when many of the nations were on the brink of extinction. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Brown's 1886 book \"Spunyarn and Spindrift, A sailor boy’s log of a voyage out and home in a China tea-clipper\" contains the earliest known usage in print of Gadget. Brown had been a strong, confident, fun-loving young man, but worked too hard, and was both incapable of relaxing and at the same time exhausted by London life. He grew jaded that his best work went unrecognised, and died 26 October 1895, only 53 years old, working to the night of his death as a writer. He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. In addition to many scientific papers, articles, and reviews in various languages, his publications included:"]}

The club is the handball department of Paris Saint-Germain. PSG Hand play in the highest tier of French handball, the LNH Division 1. The Stade Pierre de Coubertin, with a seating capacity of 3,402 spectators, is their home ground for LNH matches. For EHF Champions League matches, the club play at the Halle Georges Carpentier, which has a seating capacity of 4,300 spectators. Initially called Patriotes d'Asnières (1941–1942), the club has gone through several name changes: Asnières Sports (1942–1987), Paris-Racing-Asnières (1987–1988), Paris-Asnières (1988–1992), PSG-Asnières (1992–2002), and Paris Handball (2002–2012). After being bought by Paris Saint-Germain owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSi) in 2012, the club became Paris Saint-Germain Handball. Since its inception, the club has won 16 titles. Domestically, Paris SG have clinched five LNH Division 1 titles, four , two , a record three , and two titles. In international club handball, the capital side finished runners-up in the 2016–17 edition of the Champions League. The Parisian club was founded in 1941. Initially, it took the name of Patriotes d'Asnières before becoming Asnières Sports one year later. Asnières Sports was presided by Christian Picard, whose son Gérard Picard took over during the 1975–1976 season and remained president until 2003. In 1987, the club's management succeeded in convincing the Paris City Council to partner Asnières Sports and create a major handball team in the capital. This resulted in the Hauts-de-Seine team moving to Paris and being renamed Paris-Racing-Asnières then Paris-Asnières. Relegated in 1989, Paris-Asnières immediately bounced back to the top flight in 1990 after winning the D2 title. At the time, the club's most notable players were future French internationals Jackson Richardson and Patrick Cazal. In 1992, the club came under the management of Paris Saint-Germain, a partnership that lasted 10 years. This led to another name change, and Paris-Asnières became PSG-Asnières. PSG-Asnières finished second in the LNH Division 1 during the and then reached the French Cup final in 2001, losing to Montpellier. During that time, PSG-Asnières managed to attract several international players such as Stéphane Stoecklin, Denis Lathoud, Gaël Monthurel, Nenad Peruničić and Olivier Girault. The latter set up home in Paris in 1999, playing for the club until 2008 and then coaching the team until 2011. Under yet another name, Paris Handball began 2002 with new club owner Louis Nicollin. During the next decade, the club played in the EHF Champions League during the 2005–06 season, and won its first major trophy in 2007 with star player Kévynn Nyokas.

Under the initiative of Nasser Al-Khelaifi, a new management and playing team was assembled. Jean-Claude Blanc was named General Manager; Philippe Gardent signed as first-team manager; and a host of international stars arrived at the French capital, including Didier Dinart, Luc Abalo, Samuel Honrubia, Mikkel Hansen, José Manuel Sierra and Antonio García. In the 2012–13 season, PSG Handball claimed their maiden league success, which also meant the club secured a spot in the EHF Champions League. However, PSG were denied the double by Montpellier in the French Cup final. Big-name signings kept coming in the 2013–14 season with the arrivals of Daniel Narcisse, Igor Vori, Jakov Gojun, Fahrudin Melić and Gábor Császár.

She was featured in major films such as Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), and William Wyler's \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), playing the mother of Charlton Heston's character in both films. She originated the role of Emily Webb in Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town\" on Broadway in 1938 and later recreated the role in the 1940 film version for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Scott was born in Jamesport, Missouri, the daughter of Letha (née McKinley) and Walter Alva Scott, an engineer and garage owner. Her mother was a second cousin of U.S. President William McKinley. The Scott family remained in Jamesport until Martha was thirteen years old when they moved to Kansas City, Missouri and eventually to Detroit, Michigan. Scott became interested in acting in high school, an interest she furthered by attending the University of Michigan, earning a teaching certificate and a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama in 1934. Scott received a career boost right out of college when she appeared with the Globe Theatre Troupe in a series of Shakespeare productions at the Century of Progress world's fair in Chicago in 1934. Following that she moved to New York City, where she found steady work both in stock stage productions and in radio dramas. In 1938 she made her Broadway debut in the original staging of Thornton Wilder's play \"Our Town\" as Emily Webb, the tragic young woman who dies in childbirth. Two years later Scott reprised the role of Emily in her film debut when \"Our Town\" was made into a movie. Her critically acclaimed performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Scott was up against some of Hollywood's biggest names for the award: Katharine Hepburn, Joan Fontaine, Bette Davis, and the winner Ginger Rogers. With an Oscar nomination on her résumé, Scott found steady movie work for the next four decades, appearing in major epics such as \"The Ten Commandments\", \"Ben-Hur\", \"The Desperate Hours\", and \"Airport 1975\". Charlton Heston was a frequent co-star with Scott on both stage and screen. As she told an interviewer in 1988, \"I played his mother twice and his wife twice. I was his mother in \"Ben Hur\" and \"The Ten Commandments\". I was his wife on the stage in New York in \"Design For a Stained Glass Window\" and \"The Tumbler in London\".\" In 1968, Scott joined Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan in forming a theatrical production company called The Plumstead Playhouse. It later became the Plumstead Theatre Company and moved to Los Angeles. The company produced \"First Monday in October\", both on stage and on film. Scott co-produced both versions. Her last production was \"Twelve Angry Men\", which was performed at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, California. Martha Scott first began appearing in TV roles in the medium's early days. Her first role came in 1950 on \"The Nash Airflyte Theater\", followed by several guest appearances on \"Robert Montgomery Presents\" and other shows of television's \"golden age\", including two episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". This pattern of guest roles continued through the 1960s with appearances on \"Route 66\", \"Ironside\", and \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father\" among others. In the mid-1950s, Scott was the narrator for \"Modern Romances\", an afternoon program on NBC-TV. Scott was also a frequent TV guest star in the 1970s. She had recurring roles as Bob Newhart's mother on \"The Bob Newhart Show\", the mother of Colonel Steve Austin (Lee Majors) on both \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"The Bionic Woman\" as well as Patricia Shepard, Sue Ellen and Kristin's mother on \"Dallas\" during its early years and later during the 1986 season. Scott was cast in single episode guest appearances on several hit shows of the era like \"The Sandy Duncan Show\", \"Columbo: Playback\" (1975), \"The Mod Squad\", \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", and \"The Love Boat\". She played the role of Jennifer Talbot, Terri Brock's nasty grandmother on \"General Hospital\" for six months (1986–1987) which ended when her character was murdered and stuffed in a drain pipe. In the 1980s she had a regular role on the short-lived series \"Secrets of Midland Heights\" and appeared in several television movies and single-episode shows such as \"Magnum, P.I.\", \"The Paper Chase\", and \"Highway to Heaven\". In the late 1980s, she and Jeffrey Lynn acted in an episode of \"Murder, She Wrote\", which was a direct sequel to their 1949 feature film \"Strange Bargain\". Scott's final acting role on television was in 1990 in the movie \"Daughter of the Streets\". Martha Scott was twice-married, first to radio producer and announcer Carleton William Alsop from 1940 to 1946, and then to jazz pianist and composer Mel Powell from 1946 until his death in 1998. She had one child with Alsop, son Carleton Scott Alsop, and two daughters—Mary Powell Harpel and Kathleen Powell,—with her second husband. According to her son, Scott, his mother never forgot about her childhood hometown, using the mental image of a Jamesport cemetery in preparation for her Oscar-nominated role in \"Our Town\". Said Alsop, \"She told me she used that place as her image because it's so serene and beautiful\" and that her deceased McKinley and Scott relatives \"became the Gibbs and the Webbs in the play\". A Democrat, she supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election. Martha Scott died on May 28, 2003, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, aged 90, from natural causes. She was interred next to Powell in the Masonic Cemetery in her native Jamesport, Missouri. For her contribution in the theatre, Scott has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6126 Hollywood Boulevard."], "neg": ["Martha Stephens\nMartha Stephens Martha Stephens (born March 12, 1984) is an American film writer and director.

In the United States, the band is known as A3, to avoid legal conflict with the country music band Alabama. Every member of the group has an alias, the band's founding members adopting the personas Larry Love (Rob Spragg) and The Very Reverend Dr. D. Wayne Love (Jake Black). The band formed when Jake Black met Rob Spragg at an acid house party in Peckham and they decided that a fusion of country music with acid house was a musical possibility. Other members of the band were added over time. Rob Spragg was at university with Piers Marsh, the harmonica player and synthesiser programmer for the band, while Orlando Harrison, the group's current keyboardist, used to live with Jake Black. Prior to the formation of Alabama 3, and following the demise of The Jangletties, Black generated little or no recorded output for several years. Starting their act under the alias the First Presleyterian Church of Elvis the Divine (UK), the group eventually switched names to Alabama 3 and, after having been dismissed by the mainstream media as a novelty act, signed with One Little Indian Records in 1997 for the release of its debut album, \"Exile on Coldharbour Lane\".

It was moved to 1386 kHz with the introduction of 9 kHz spacing on the AM dial in 1978. The station now broadcasts on 1395 kHz. 5AA commenced its life with a \"Beautiful Music\" format and quickly became Adelaide's no 1 rating radio station. In 1976, the only FM competition was the ABC owned Classic FM. AM stations were the ABC owned 5AN, 5DN 972 - \"Licensed to talk\" and music stations 5KA on 1197AM and 5AD on 1323AM.

The station shifted to the TAB headquarters in Pulteney Court, Adelaide, with \"Talk of the Town\" as its slogan. However, it plummeted in popularity as a result of its schizophrenic broadcasting policy. With the advent of narrowcast licences, the TAB purchased frequency 1539AM and shifted all racing there, freeing up 5AA for talk and interviews.

It is one of the stations in the ABC Local Radio network and broadcasts on 105.7MHz on the FM dial. It is an Australian Government sponsored station and is run through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1947, the ABC took over an old Army station, 5DR, and relaunched it as its first station in the Northern Territory. In the early days, its staffers lived in huts without air conditioning, and most programming was flown up on discs. Since there was only one newspaper in the area, 5DR frequently broadcast funeral arrangements because the Northern Territory's humid climate made it impossible to keep a body for any long period of time. In 1960 all Northern Territory radio stations moved from the 5 prefix previously shared with South Australia to the 8 prefix, the station becoming 8DR. The station came into its own in 1974, when Cyclone Tracy slammed into Darwin. Dick Muddimer, one of the station's reporters, was able to get to the studios of local television station NTD-8 and send a message to the ABC studios in Mount Isa asking them to notify Sydney that Darwin had been struck by a cyclone. Due to the great distance between Darwin and the rest of Australia and the fact the storm made landfall on Christmas Day, most of the rest of the nation didn't know about Tracy until mid-afternoon. It was the only station whose transmitter was not completely disabled by the storm, and for the next two days was the only link between Darwin and the outside world.

Seed was born in Chicago and graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Illinois before attending Harvard University, earning his undergraduate degree there in 1949. He later received a master's degree, as well as a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard in 1953. His interests soon shifted to the new frontier of biomedicine. In the 1970s Seed co-founded a company that commercialized a technique for transferring embryos in cattle. Later, he and his brother, Chicago surgeon Randolph Seed, started another company, Fertility & Genetics Research Inc., to help infertile women conceive children using the same technique. These efforts to transplant a human embryo from one woman to an infertile surrogate mother were published in 1984. The cumbersome procedure involved flushing embryos out of the uterus of the egg donor—and was soon eclipsed by in-vitro fertilization. Ultimately the venture failed. On December 5, 1997, Seed announced that he planned to clone a human being before any federal laws could be enacted to ban the process. Seed's announcement added fuel to the raging ethical debate on human cloning that had been sparked by Ian Wilmut's creation of Dolly the sheep, the first clone obtained from adult cells. Seed's plans were to use the same technique used by the Scottish team. Seed's announcement went against President Clinton's 1997 proposal for a voluntary private moratorium against human cloning. In the media frenzy that followed, the story of a 69-year-old eccentric, and maverick scientist emerged, but Seed possessed impressive credentials and was not dismissed immediately. While virtually no mainstream scientist believed Seed would succeed, there began a subtle shift in attitudes after Seed made his announcement. Retired at the time of his announcement to clone the first human, Seed was reported to have dabbled in ill-fated ventures in the past. He claimed at one time to have commitments for $800,000 toward a goal of $2.5 million needed to clone the first human before 2000. Seed first said that he was going to make little baby clones for infertile couples. Later, \"to defuse criticism that I'm taking advantage of desperate women,\" he announced that he would first clone himself. Still later he announced that he would re-create his wife Gloria. \"God made man in his own image,\" he told National Public Radio correspondent Joe Palca in December 1997. \"God intended for man to become one with God. Cloning, is the first serious step in becoming one with God.\" In a later interview on CNN, Seed elaborated: \"Man,\" he said, \"will develop the technology and the science and the capability to have an indefinite life span.\" Seed was awarded the 1998 Ig Nobel Prize in economics, and a performance titled \"The Seedy Opera\" debuted at the event."], "neg": ["Michael Seed\nMichael Seed Father Michael Seed (born 1957) is a Latin Rite Catholic priest, a Franciscan friar, author, and former Ecumenical Advisor for over 25 years to the former Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Basil Hume then to Cormac Murphy-O'Connor. Seed is known for his involvement in helping several British celebrities, members of the Royal Family and politicians decide whether to convert to Catholicism. Michael Seed was born as Steven Wayne Godwin in Manchester, 1957, to a young woman called Marie, and baptised into the Catholic Church as an infant. He was adopted in 1958 by Joseph and Lillian Seed. During his early childhood he and Lillian were subjected to abuse at the hands of his adoptive father, resulting in a number of suicide attempts by his mother. Seed was subjected to relentless bullying during his school years, alongside the constant abuse he faced at home. Following the suicide of his mother in 1966 and the death of his father in 1968, he was raised by his maternal grandmother. In his youth, Seed was involved in several different Christian denominations, including Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, the Salvation Army and the Baptist Union. Eventually, at the age of 18, Seed joined the Society of African Missions in 1976 and spent a year at the novitiate in Cork (city) in Ireland. After the novitiate he went to the SMA's house in New Barnet in north London and attended the now-defunct Missionary Institute in Mill Hill along with members of several religious congregations which prepare men for a lifetime of service to the poor of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Seed struck up a relationship with the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement (the Society of the Atonement) who ran a library close to Westminster Cathedral and eventually left his missionary society and joined the Franciscans, taking his first vows in 1982. He was ordained a priest on 18 January 1986 and, in 1988, Cardinal Basil Hume assigned him the post of Secretary for Ecumenical Affairs at Westminster Cathedral. Whilst at Westminster Cathedral, Seed assisted numerous people, including MPs Ann Widdecombe, John Gummer as well as The Duchess of Kent, in their decision to enter the Catholic Church. He celebrated Masses for the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his family, prior to Blair's conversion to Catholicism in December 2007. He also has many connections with celebrity figures such as Charles Kennedy, and Terry Wogan . In 2003 Seed was painted by artist Christian Furr who has done a portrait of the Queen. In 1991 Seed appeared on an \"After Dark\" television discussion programme about sexaholics. He was later quoted saying: \"I went on a programme called\" After Dark \"on Channel 4 once with a prostitute, a psychiatrist and a gay man. Afterwards they all started coming to see me.\" In 2007, it was rumoured that Seed was in trouble with Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor; allegedly, the Cardinal was upset that Seed had introduced wealthy businessmen to government officials in an attempt to secure financing for Labour's flagship academies. Some speculated that Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor saw this move by Seed as unwarranted support of specific Labour policies. The Cardinal was also reported as being annoyed at Seed's statement that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, would become a Catholic upon leaving Downing Street. As noted above, Blair did indeed become a Catholic shortly after leaving office. However, Michael Seed only vacated his long standing position as Ecumenical Advisor on the retirement of Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor in 2008 when he was succeeded by Cardinal Vincent Nichols as the Archbishop of Westminster. Catholic peer Lord Alton said: \"I hope that any decision taken about his future will ensure that his wonderful gifts are used in the most productive way. Fr Michael is hugely respected at Westminster where he has quietly undertaken very considerable pastoral work.\" Catherine Pepinster, editor of Catholic newspaper \"The Tablet\", added: \"Many Catholics are dismayed by the departure of Fr Seed. He has been a fixture of Catholic life in London for many years and has done much to raise the church's profile.\" In 2004, Pope John Paul II awarded him a cross of honour for his work. Michael Seed has written several books including his autobiography \"Nobody's Child\" in 2008 which has had excellent reviews and has been described as a \"blazing testament to one human's raw courage, and his remarkable ability to finally triumph over the horrors of a stolen childhood.\" Other books include \"Thinking of Becoming a Catholic\" (2007) and \"I Will See You in Heaven\" (1996), \"Will I See You in Heaven\" (1999), and \"Letters from the Heart\" (2000). One of his first books, \"I Will See You in Heaven, Where Animals Don't Bite\" (1991) is a collection of letters about heaven by various famous people with a forward by Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Cardinal Basil Hume was one of the book's contributors and enjoyed a very close relationship with Michael Seed who helped him raise funds for the homeless centre The Passage which is still going strong. One of these fund raising events arranged by Michael Seed was the annual \"A Night Under The Stars\". On 15 July 2009, Seed launched the second volume of his autobiography, \"Sinners and Saints\", at Stringfellows lapdancing club in London's West End. The book received mixed reviews: The \"Telegraph\" \"enjoyed the strange tale of carnality and cardinals\". \"Church Times\" referred to it as an \"unpriestly book\" and \"careless talk\" with A.N. Wilson of \"The Observer\" bluntly stating that \"He has now left Westminster Cathedral but he will surely not have left the public stage. Where two or three Hello!-style celebs are gathered together, Father Michael Seed will surely be there in their midst, managing to be both clumsily sycophantic and intrusive.\" Regarding the alleged claim, by Seed, that Alan Clark became a Catholic on his death bed, Wilson asks \"Which of the two – the dead Clark or God – leaked the story of his deathbed conversion to a newspaper we shall never know.\" Others, such as Peter Stanford, writing in The Independent newspaper point out that if Seed were \"...indiscreet, the queue of people wanting to sit where I am now would quickly disappear.\" Indeed, even regarding his celebration of the Mass in Downing Street Stanford writes: \"Father Seed is eager to portray this special treatment not as a privilege, but as a kind of torture. \"Mrs Blair\" – he never uses their first names – \"absolutely hated it. She hated not being able to go to Mass with everyone else.\" In a 2007 article in the Telegraph an anonymous friend is quoted as saying, \"I've seen him after he has drunk far too much white wine in Soho. And I've seen his deeply spiritual side. He really does care. He is an extraordinary, special chap. A party in my garden once attracted the attention of the noise abatement people. He charmed them to death - they thought he was in fancy dress - and they gave up and went away. He's always up to adventures and mishaps.\"  In 2011, it was reported that, due to financial irregularities, Fr. Seed had been suspended by the Society of the Atonement. As of October 2018, he did not appear in the Society's list of friars."]}

On central Florida's Space Coast, the airport is reached by NASA Boulevard (State Road 508). It is governed by a seven-member board which is appointed by the Melbourne City Council and the private sector. The airport budget is part of the Melbourne municipal budget; the airport receives no local tax dollars. The projected expenses for 2010 is $14.1 million. The executive director of the airport is Greg Donovan, A.A.E. Melbourne International Airport began in 1928 when a Pitcairn Aircraft landed on a cow pasture strip north of Kissimmee Highway. Airmail service started in late 1928 when the airport was designated a fueling stop. In 1933 the City of Melbourne acquired west of Indian River Bluff to develop as a new airport, which was further developed and operated as Naval Air Station Melbourne during World War II. Returned to the city as a Surplus Property Airport after the War, Melbourne Airport was deeded to the city in 1947. It was a municipal airport until 1967 when the city created the Melbourne Airport Authority to plan, operate, maintain, and develop the airport, then called Melbourne Municipal Airport. The name was Cape Kennedy Regional Airport and city officials changed the name to Melbourne Regional Airport in 1973 to better reflect it's role. In January 1951, the airport had runways 4, 9, 13 and 16, all long. Scheduled airline flights began in 1953. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide listed four Eastern Airlines departures, Martin 4-0-4s to Vero Beach, Daytona Beach and Jacksonville. National Airlines arrived in 1959 with Douglas DC-6Bs and scheduled the first jet flights in 1963: Douglas DC-8s Miami-Melbourne-New Orleans-Houston-Los Angeles and Los Angeles-Houston-Melbourne-Miami. In 1960, Meadowlane Elementary School first opened at a Naval hospital on the airport grounds. The school moved to West Melbourne in 1961. In 1969, a National DC-8 flew Los Angeles-Tampa-Melbourne-Miami. Houston and Los Angeles figured in NASA's space program, and Melbourne was close to the NASA Kennedy Space Center. In July 1974 a National Boeing 727 flew Miami-Melbourne-Tampa-New Orleans-Los Angeles-San Diego; National Boeing 727-200s flew direct Houston and New Orleans to Melbourne. In May 1979 National had one flight a day from Melbourne, a 727-200 to Tampa. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Eastern Airlines Boeing 727s, Douglas DC-9s and Lockheed Electras flew out of the airport. In June 1967 Eastern announced \"The Space Corridor\" from Melbourne to three centers in the space program: Huntsville, Alabama, St. Louis and Seattle. Eastern's \"Space Corridor\" was a Melbourne-Orlando-Huntsville-St. Louis-Seattle Boeing 727-100. In June 1967 Eastern flew nonstop Melbourne to Atlanta, Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale and direct to New York City (JFK Airport), Washington, D.C. (Dulles Airport), Boston and Miami. In February 1976 Eastern flew a 727 direct Los Angeles to Melbourne via Atlanta; Eastern eventually dropped Melbourne upon the airlines closure in 1991. In the early 1980s some ending scenes for the film Stranger Than Paradise were shot in the Melbourne area, including several plot scenes shot at the Airport (as listed in the credits). People Express Airlines started nonstops to Newark, Baltimore, Columbus and Buffalo, New York in spring 1982 with Boeing 737 jets. They eventually scaled back to just nonstops to Newark and ended service to MLB in 1986. Delta Air Lines started nonstops to Atlanta in 1983 with DC-9's and upgraded to Boeing 737's and MD-80's. The Authority operated a recreational vehicle site, \"Port O' Call.\" This was closed and the tenants evicted in 2003. The intent was to use the property for commercial development. The Melbourne Airport Authority operates Tropical Haven (formerly Trailer Haven), a 759-site manufactured home park. In 2010 the airport had non-stop flights to Atlanta on Delta Air Lines and regional partner Atlantic Southeast Airlines, as well as non-stops to Charlotte Douglas International Airport on US Airways' regional subsidiary PSA Airlines. Delta used to fly non-stop from Melbourne to its hubs in Cincinnati, New York-JFK and New York-La Guardia, and to Washington-Dulles and Washington-Reagan; all of this was discontinued. USA3000 Airlines briefly served Melbourne with flights to Baltimore/Washington. Presidential Airways (scheduled) had nonstop flights to Daytona Beach and Washington, DC (Dulles) with Boeing 737s and BAE-146 Jets. American Airlines served Melbourne with flights to Raleigh/Durham on MD-80 jets and Continental flew to Newark-Liberty with 727 and 737 aircraft. Direct Air flew to Niagara Falls, NY and Punta Gorda, Fl with 737 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 Jets. Elite Airways began operating at the airport in 2014 with flights to Washington Dulles International Airport. In 2015, there were an estimated 15,000 paid attendees to the annual air show over a two-day weekend. The airport's first scheduled international service was announced by Porter Airlines in September, 2015 to Toronto's island airport. In 2015, the airport changed its name to \"Orlando Melbourne International Airport\". Airport and local tourism officials wanted to brand the airport as a less-congested alternative to Orlando's two airports. They also believed it would attract visitors who wanted to see Walt Disney World, Cape Canaveral, and the area's beaches. The airport is located approximately southeast of the City of Orlando. In 2017, a $20 million upgrade was proposed for the airport, 90 percent coming from FAA funds, almost $1 million from FDOT and $1 million from the airport. Monthly passengers were at a seasonal low in September 2007 at 14,083. A high was experienced in March 2010 of 41,725. Total enplaned and deplaned passengers for 2008 numbered about 286,000. 229,000 passengers used the airport in 2009, a 24% drop from 2008. Passengers rose 70% in 2010 over 2009, as US Airways restarted service and Delta expanded. The airport covers 2,800 acres (1,133 ha) and has three asphalt runways: 9R/27L is 10,181 × 150 ft (3,103 × 46 m), 9L/27R is 6,000 × 150 ft (1,829 × 46 m) and 5/23 is 3,001 × 75 ft (915 × 23 m). The main terminal building is named the Edward L. Foster Air Terminal. In the year ending November 30, 2017 the airport had 101,868 aircraft operations, 279 per day; 90% were general aviation, 5% scheduled commercial, 5% air taxi and <1% military. 262 aircraft at the time were based at this airport: 70% single-engine, 14% multiengine, 12% jet, 2% helicopter and <1% military. The Airport Museum is in the terminal building. The Florida Institute of Technology Research, Science and Technology Park covers about surrounded by airport tenants such as Northrop Grumman Joint Stars, G.E Railway, Rockwell Collins, DRS Technologies, and L-3, and leases property to two hospitals and one hotel. A new Embraer Business Jet Assembly Facility, intended to employ 200 workers, is under construction. Production facilities are for the Phenom 100 and 300, and Legacy 450 and 500. In 2010 two companies, AAR Corporation and MidAirUSA, announced plans for facilities at the airport. The companies intended to respectively employ 225 and 300 people. MidAirUSA went bankrupt in 2015; Aeromod International took over the MidAirUSA hangar in 2016. The airport handled about in January 2014."], "neg": ["Transport in Melbourne\nTransport in Melbourne Transport in Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia, consists of several interlinking modes. Melbourne is a hub for intercity, intracity and regional travel. Road-based transport accounts for most trips across many parts of the city, facilitated by Australia's largest freeway network. Public transport, including the world's largest tram network, trains and buses, also forms a key part of the transport system. Other dominant modes include walking, cycling and commercial-passenger vehicle services such as taxis. Melbourne is a busy regional transport hub for the statewide passenger rail network, coaches and interstate rail services to New South Wales and South Australia. Freight transport also makes up a significant proportion of trips made on the network from the Port of Melbourne, Melbourne Airport and industrial areas across the city. According to the 2016 Australian census, Melbourne has the second-highest rate of public transport usage among Australian capital cities for travel to work at 19 percent, second to Sydney's 27 percent. Melbourne has the most road space per capita of any Australian city, with its freeway network being comparable to Los Angeles and Atlanta in terms of its size and scale. Much of Australia's automotive industry was located in Melbourne until all manufacturing ceased at the end of 2017. The state government, as part of the release of the Melbourne 2030 planning strategy in 2002, set an target for modal share of cars to decrease to 80 percent by 2020. However, increases in car usage since this target was set has not shown the decline that was initially predicted.  Melbourne's public transport system includes rail, tram and bus services. Its tram network is the largest in the world. Almost 300 bus routes and 16 rail lines serve Greater Melbourne. Melbourne has a fully integrated ticketing system across all modes of public transport in the metropolitan area, known as the 'myki' contactless smart card. This requires passengers to touch the card to a reader at each entry and exit point. myki's rollout began on 29 December 2009 on the rail network. It was then progressively rolled out to trams, buses and regional rail. It completely replaced the old magnetic stripe card Metcard system on 30 June 2013. Since World War II Melbourne has become a dispersed, car-oriented city, leading to a decline in public transport use. The original transport patterns of urban development are still reflected Melbourne's prewar areas. The city's public transport system was privatised by the government in 1999. Under this arrangement, rail and tram operations are contracted to private companies while the infrastructure remained under government control. Several operators have been awarded contracts since its commencement, including Connex Melbourne, M>Train and Keolis Downer. Despite initial plans that government subsidies would decrease to zero by 2015, payments to private companies have instead increased significantly. A 2009 space syntax analysis of Melbourne's tram and train network found that only 8.8 percent of residents in Greater Melbourne was within 30 minutes of any location in the greater Melbourne area and only 10–15 percent could access appropriate and timely public transport. Melbourne's public transport system handled seven percent of all trips within the metropolitan area; the figure increased to nine percent in early 2009, with the passenger-kilometre share increasing to 11 percent. The bus network consists of about 50 bus companies under a franchise agreement with the state Government. Approximately 300 routes are in operation, including twenty-one night bus routes that operate on Friday and Saturday nights. Bus patronage is low compared to similar cities around Australia, which some experts have attributed to the presence of the tram network servicing many trips that would normally be taken by bus. Several 'SmartBus' routes were introduced in the late 2000s in an attempt to improve parts of the system with improved bus priority and frequencies and span of service hours better than most other bus routes at the time. Despite its success at significantly increasing bus patronage, the branding was scrapped in 2014 and bus priority gradually removed to give more space to cars. Although all Melbourne buses use the myki ticketing system, the Skybus Super Shuttle between Melbourne Airport and Southern Cross railway station is a non-myki bus service. Several local government councils also operate free community bus services in their local areas including Port Phillip, Nillumbik and Darebin Melbourne has the world's largest tram network, consisting of of track, nearly 500 trams on 28 routes, and 1,813 tram stops. It is operated by Keolis Downer. Two partial-light rail routes are also part of the network. Most of the remaining track is mixes with general traffic which also makes it one of the slowest tram networks in the world. Trams operate mostly in the inner suburbs and generally provide for short to medium-length trips. Heritage trams operate on the free City Circle route and privately run Colonial Tramcar Restaurant. Melbourne has a 16 line urban heavy rail network which is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne and serviced by a fleet of 326 EMU trains. With the exception of the Stony Point line, the entire urban rail network is electrified. The urban network is considered to be a commuter-heavy rail hybrid and not a metro system of high-frequency and high-capacity services. Metropolitan, rural and interstate railway networks link together at the Southern Cross railway station, in Melbourne's central business district, with the other principal station being Flinders Street railway station. Melbourne is the centre of a statewide railway network consisting of lines used for freight and passenger service. Intrastate passenger services are operated by the government-owned V/Line corporation, with a fleet of locomotive-hauled trains and diesel multiple units. Seven passenger railway lines connect Melbourne to towns and cities in Victoria. Portions of lines which are part of the V/Line network and cover the metropolitan area are also covered by myki tickets. The city is also connected to Sydney by the NSW TrainLink XPT, and to Adelaide by Great Southern Rail's \"The Overland\". Melbourne's public-transport system is divided into two zones, in addition to the free tram zone in the central business district and some surrounding areas. Myki has two forms of tickets: myki money (in which money is loaded on a myki and the system selects the \"best fare\") and the myki-pass, where commuters pre-purchase tickets (or passes). The Port of Melbourne is Australia's largest container and general cargo port, handling 33 percent of Australia's container trade. Shipping lines operate to about 300 cities around the world, and 3,200 ships visit the port each year. The port is in Melbourne's inner west, near the junction of the Maribyrnong and Yarra Rivers. Melbourne has an extensive network of railway lines and yards to serve freight traffic. The lines have two gauges – broad gauge and standard gauge – and are not electrified. Freight trains have their own lines in the city's inner western suburbs, but in other areas trains are required to share the tracks with Metro Trains Melbourne and V/Line passenger service. Most freight terminals are in the inner suburbs near the port between Melbourne's central business district and Footscray. A number of suburban stations had their own goods yards, with freight trains running on the suburban network until the 1980s. Melbourne Airport, located in the north-western suburb of Tullamarine, is Australia's second-busiest airport. It serves over 30 airlines and 22 million international and domestic passengers annually. The airport is a hub for passenger airlines Qantas, Jetstar Airways, Tiger Airways Australia and Virgin Australia, and cargo airlines Qantas Freight and Toll Priority. Melbourne's second major passenger airport, Avalon Airport (Melbourne Avalon), is south-west of the city and north-east of Geelong. Avalon Airport, primarily used by Jetstar, operates flights to Brisbane, Sydney and Perth. AirAsia X was expected to begin low-cost flights from Avalon to Kuala Lumpur in October 2009, giving Melbourne a second international airport (unique among Australia's capital cities). The city's first major airport, Essendon Airport, is no longer used for scheduled international flights. Although a small number of regional airlines operate from there, it is primarily used for general aviation and is also home to Victoria's air ambulance. Moorabbin Airport, south of Melbourne, is primarily used for recreational flying and flying lessons. It has some regional-airline service, notably to King Island, Tasmania. Moorabbin is a Class D airport, and its ICAO airport code is YMMB. RAAF Williams, Point Cook, where the Royal Australian Air Force originated, is located near Melbourne's south-western limits. Melbourne is one of the world's most car-dependent cities, with 74 percent of all trips to and from work or education being done by car. Its freeway network is the largest in Australia, with an extensive grid of arterial roads dating back to Melbourne's initial surveying. The city's total road length is . The freeway network began with the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, which included a grid of freeways which would cover the metropolitan area. The plans were reviewed four years later and many inner-city projects were cancelled. Freeways built during the 1960s and 1970s include the South Eastern Arterial (now part of the Monash Freeway), the Tullamarine Freeway, the Lower Yarra Freeway (now the West Gate Freeway) and the Eastern Freeway. Expansion took place over the next thirty years, with the Monash Freeway, CityLink and the Western Ring Road all being constructed during this time. The period also saw freeway expansion into the suburbs with the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, an extension of the Eastern Freeway and the South Gippsland Freeway. In 2008, the EastLink toll freeway opened and existing freeways were further extended. Despite government figures indicating slowed growth in road travel since 2006 (zero growth in 2008–09) and the government's goal to reduce road use to 80 percent of all motorised trips, the State Government have announced several large-scale road infrastructure investments to complete many projects from the original 1969 Plan, including Peninsula Link, East West Link and North East Link). This road construction has continued to increase the use of cars and direct investment away from other transport projects. Melbourne has an extensive network of bicycle paths and bike lanes, which are used for recreation and commuting. Five of the top 10 suburbs for bicycle mode share for journeys to work are located in Melbourne. A series of major off-road paths shared with pedestrians caters for bike riders in the inner suburbs, but infrastructure tends to be less extensive further away into surrounding suburbs. On 31 May 2010, Australia's first public bicycle-sharing system (Melbourne Bike Share) was introduced. The complete system consists of 50 docking stations with 600 bikes located throughout the city's central business district. Singaporean bike-sharing company oBike entered the Melbourne market in mid-2017, but abandoned its program in 2018 following extensive complaints and issues with its business practices. Taxis in Melbourne have since 1 July 2013 been regulated by the Taxi Services Commission, which began operation on 19 July. The Taxi Industry Inquiry resulted in major reforms to Victoria's taxi industry, significantly impacting taxi service in Melbourne. Taxis were required to be painted canary yellow until this requirement was abolished in 2013. Melbourne has 4,660 licensed, metered taxis, including 443 wheelchair-accessible cabs. Ridesharing operators, such as Uber, DiDi, Shofer, Taxify, GoCatch, Shebah, and Ola, also operate in Melbourne. Public Transport Victoria oversees two ferry services in Victoria: the Westgate Punt (between Spotswood and Fishermans Bend) and the French Island Ferry, which operates between the Stony Point railway station, French Island and Cowes on Phillip Island. Cruise ships and ferries (including the Spirit of Tasmania, which crosses Bass Strait to Tasmania) dock at Station Pier on Port Phillip Bay. Privately run ferries and other vessels also travel from Southbank along the Yarra River, to Williamstown, and across Port Phillip Bay. The main transport statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act 2010, which establishes and sets the charters of the state agencies charged with providing transport and managing the state's transport system. The Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources is responsible for the integration and coordination of Victoria's transport system. However, other departments and agencies also have a coordination and implementation role in transport. Other key state agencies are: There are several agencies and organisations tasked with coordinating and delivering transport in Victoria. Many fall within the purview of Transport for Victoria, but others are run from other departments or are independent government organisations. In 2010, the state government resolved to create a new independent agency to coordinate and oversee all aspects of the state's public transport. According to the government, the authority would plan, co-ordinate, manage and administer metropolitan trams and metropolitan and regional buses and trains, replacing the previous structure of multiple agencies. The authority was established in late 2011, and was expected to be fully operational by mid-2012. Public Transport Victoria assumed the rail, tram and bus responsibilities of the former Director of Public Transport and the activities of the Transport Ticketing Authority and MetLink, which were abolished. In 2016, the state government established a new coordinating agency for transport in the state. It serves as an umbrella agency, overseeing the activities of several other transport organisations and agencies across multiple modes of transport. This includes VicRoads, Public Transport Victoria and V/Line. The agency was established in 2017 and operates under the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources. The government announced a Taxi Industry Inquiry and the establishment of a Taxi Services Commission (TSC) in early 2011. The inquiry, headed by Allan Fels, was conducted by the TSC (which succeeded the Victorian Taxi Directorate, part of the office of the Director of Public Transport which – in turn –is part of the Department of Transport). The government introduced the Transport Legislation Amendment (Taxi Services Reform and Other Matters) Act 2011, which was enacted in late June 2011 to empower the inquiry. The TSC, established on 19 July 2011, became the state's taxi and hire-car regulator on 1 July 2013. The government reversed the late-2010 merger of the Port of Melbourne Corporation (PMC) and the Port of Hastings Corporation by establishing the new Port of Hastings Development Authority to oversee development of a new port in Hastings. The Transport Legislation Amendment (Port of Hastings Development Authority) Bill 2011 was passed by the Parliament of Victoria in late 2011, and the authority began operations on 1 January 2012. The safety of rail operations in Melbourne is regulated by the 2006 Rail Safety Act, which applies to commercial passenger and freight operations and tourist and heritage railways. The act created a framework of safety requirements for all rail-industry participants, and requires rail operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation before commencing operations. Accredited rail operators are required to have a safety-management system to guide their operations. Sanctions for violations of the safety requirements established by the Rail Safety Act are outlined in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. Safety regulation of the bus and marine sectors is overseen by the Director, Transport Safety under the 2009 Bus Safety Act and the Marine Act 1988, respectively. The sectors are subject to a no-fault safety-investigation plan conducted by the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety. The safety regulator for Melbourne's rail, bus and marine systems is Transport Safety Victoria, established under the Transport Integration Act 2010. Rail, bus and marine operators in Victoria can be subjected to no-fault investigations by the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety or the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). The chief investigator is charged by Part 7 of the Transport Integration Act 2010 with investigating rail, bus and marine safety matters, including incidents. The ATSB has jurisdiction over rail matters (on a designated interstate rail network), marine matters (if the ship(s) is under Australian or AMSA regulation) and bus-safety matters (by invitation of a jurisdiction). Ticketing requirements for rail, tram and bus service in Victoria are primarily contained in Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006 and the Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual. Rules about safe and fair behaviour on trains and trams in Victoria are generally contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 and Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005. Conduct requirements for buses are set out in that act and Transport (Passenger Vehicles) Regulations 2005.", "Mangalore Airport (Victoria)\nMangalore Airport (Victoria) Mangalore Airport is located west Mangalore, Victoria, Australia. The airport is about 2 hours north of Melbourne by road, and is home to the Helicopter Pilot College, Kestrel Aviation and Moorabbin Aviation Services (Mangalore Campus). It was established in 1939 for training Royal Australian Air Force pilots. In 1947 it became a civil airfield and until 1970 it was an alternative for Essendon Airport. From November 2007 to April 2009, the airport was home to the Australian Airline Pilot Academy (AAPA) owned by Regional Express Airlines. AAPA relocated to Wagga Airport, New South Wales in 2009. In June 2017 Moorabbin Aviation Services Pty Ltd established a campus at Mangalore Airport where they undertake pilot training of international students. One of their major clients being China Southern Airlines, training their airline cadets."]}
{"query": "America band members' musical style and influences outside of Ian Samwell's production work.", "pos": ["America (Simon & Garfunkel song)\nAmerica (Simon &amp; Garfunkel song) \"America\" is a song performed by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel, which they released from their fourth studio album, \"Bookends,\" in 1968. Produced by the duo and Roy Halee, the song was later issued as a single in 1972 to promote the release of \"Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits.\" The song was written and composed by Paul Simon, and concerns young lovers hitchhiking their way across the United States, in search of \"America,\" in both a literal and figurative sense. It was inspired by a 1964 road trip that Simon took with his then girlfriend Kathy Chitty. The song has been regarded as one of Simon's strongest songwriting efforts and one of the duo's best songs. A 2014 \"Rolling Stone\" reader's poll ranked it the group's fourth best song. \"America\" was inspired by a five-day road excursion Simon undertook in September 1964 with his then girlfriend Kathy Chitty. Producer Tom Wilson had called Simon back to the United States to finalize mixes and artwork for their debut studio album, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\" Simon, living in London at the time, was reluctant to leave Chitty, and invited her to come with him, forgetting the album and spending five days driving the country together. Several years later, \"America\" was among the last songs recorded for \"Bookends,\" when production assistant John Simon left Columbia Records, forcing Simon, Garfunkel, and producer Roy Halee to complete the record themselves. In 2004, Bob Dyer, a former disc jockey from Saginaw, Michigan, explained the song's genesis in an interview with \"The Saginaw News.\" According to Dyer, Simon wrote the song while visiting the town in 1966, when he booked him for Y-A-Go-Go, a concert series hosted by the Saginaw YMCA. \"America\" is a song that \"creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals.\" Art Garfunkel once described the song as \"young lovers with their adventure and optimism\". The song has been described as a \"folk song with a lilting soprano saxophone in its refrain as a small pipe organ paints acoustic guitars, framed by the ghostly traces of classic American Songbook pop structures.\" According to EMI Music Publishing's digital sheet music for the song, \"America\" is composed in the key of E-flat major and set in a 6/8 time signature, and has a moderately fast groove of 172 beats per minute. The duo's vocals span from the low note of B♭ to the high note of F. Drummer Hal Blaine, keyboardist Larry Knechtel, and bassist Joe Osborn provide additional instrumentation on the track. The lyrics do not follow any formal rhyme scheme. The song opens, on \"Bookends,\" with a crossfade from \"Save the Life of My Child.\" (This effect is not present on the single versions, which begin with a \"clean\" open.) The song follows two young lovers — \"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance\" — who set out \"to look for America.\" The song makes reference to the town of Saginaw, Michigan, with the protagonist seemingly hailing from the town, but \"[seeking] his fortunes elsewhere.\" The narrator's companion Kathy is a reference to Chitty, linking the song autobiographically to the earlier Simon and Garfunkel hit \"Homeward Bound,\" and to \"Kathy's Song,\" a love song from a previous album, \"Sounds of Silence.\" The narrator spends four days hitchhiking from Saginaw to join Kathy in Pittsburgh, where together they board a Greyhound bus to continue the journey. The narrator begins with a lighthearted and optimistic outlook (\"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together\") that fades over the course of the song. To pass time, he and Kathy play games and try to guess the backgrounds of their fellow passengers. Over the course of their journey, they smoke all their cigarettes. Kathy reads a magazine before falling asleep, leaving the narrator awake to reflect on the meaning of the journey alone. In the final verse, the narrator is able to speak his true emotions to Kathy, now that she is sleeping and cannot hear or answer. \"I'm empty and aching and I don't know why\" captures the longing and angst of the 1960s in nine simple words. The narrator then stares out the window \"counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike.\" Many other empty, aching, and lost souls are on the highway, each on their own journey alone even if someone is traveling with them. The soaring harmony lines and crashing cymbals create a powerful and poignant end to the song's final verse: \"They've all come to look for America.\" Pete Fornatale interprets this lyric as a \"metaphor to remind us all of the lost souls wandering the highways and byways of mid-sixties America, struggling to navigate the rapids of despair and hope, optimism and disillusionment.\" Stephen Holden, in reviewing \"Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest Hits\" in 1972, wrote, \"'America' ... was Simon's next major step forward. It is three and a half minutes of sheer brilliance, whose unforced narrative, alternating precise detail with sweeping observation evokes the panorama of restless, paved America and simultaneously illuminates a drama of shared loneliness on a bus trip with cosmic implications.\" Thom Jurek of Allmusic described the song's central question as an \"ellipsis, a cipher, an unanswerable question,\" a song in which \"sophisticated harmonic invention is toppled by its message.\" David Nichols, in \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die,\" called the song \"a splendid vignette of a road trip by young lovers; both intimate and epic in scale, it traces an inner journey from naive optimism to more mature understanding.\" \"American Songwriter\" deemed the song \"essentially a road-trip song, but like all road trips, it tends to reveal as much about the participants as it does about the lands being traversed.\" Disc jockey and author Pete Fornatale describes \"America\" as one of Paul Simon's \"greatest writing achievements in this phase of his career.\" In 2014, a \"Rolling Stone\" readers poll ranked it fourth among the duo's best compositions, with the magazine writing, \"it captured America's sense of restlessness and confusion during the year that saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, as well as the escalation of the war in Vietnam,\" declaring it one of their most \"beloved\" songs. Amy S. of ClassicRockHistory defined \"America,\" as Simon and Garfunkels best song. The author described the song America as \"perhaps the most representative of Simon & Garfunkel’s music: wistful and optimistic, personal and universal, and most of all, uniquely American.\" The song enjoyed a resurgence in popularity — and was introduced to a new generation — after being featured in Cameron Crowe's critically acclaimed film \"Almost Famous\" in 2000. An early scene in the film, set in 1973, finds the free-spirited character \"Anita\" (Zooey Deschanel) playing the song for her mother (Frances McDormand) to \"... explain why [she] is leaving home to become a stewardess.\" The financial services company American Express also used the song in a series of popular television advertisements in the late 2000s. In 2010, lyrics from the song began appearing spray-painted on vacant buildings and abandoned factories in the town of Saginaw, Michigan, which is mentioned in the song. The group of artists, Paint Saginaw, decided to paint the phrases after the population had dwindled vastly, noting that the song became rather \"homesick\" for the town's residents. The song's entire lyrics are painted on 28 buildings in the city, including railroad tracks and bridge supports. The song was featured in \"America,\" a television advertisement for the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The campaign sought permission to use it from Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel themselves, who both agreed. Garfunkel stated that he was a supporter of Sanders and his campaign, and that the usage of \"America\" did not take away from the song's original premise. The song appears in a 2017 TV commercial for the Volkswagen Atlas. The song was rearranged by the progressive rock band Yes in 1970, performing it in concert on the first tour after Steve Howe replaced Peter Banks. Yes added elements typical to progressive rock, such as changes in time signature and long instrumental segments, while dropping the song's original repeat and fade ending. At one point bassist Chris Squire quotes \"America\" from \"West Side Story\" in the intro. The Yes studio version clocks in at ten and a half minutes, with live versions on the 1970-1971 tour extended to more than fifteen minutes. The studio recording first appeared in 1972 on the sampler album \"The New Age of Atlantic\" and was later included on the compilation album \"Yesterdays\" in 1975, the box set \"\" in 2002, and on the 2003 re-issue of their album \"Fragile.\" An edited version of this recording lasting 4 minutes was released as a single and hit #46 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It also reached #20 in New Zealand. It also appeared on the \"Yesyears\" boxed set and its condensed version \"Yesstory,\" along with \".\" The edited version was also included as a bonus track on the 2003 re-issue of \"Close to the Edge\", while the unedited studio version appears on Steven Wilson's 2013 remix of the same album. A live version of the song was included on 1996's \"Keys to Ascension\" as well as a performance from the final show of the 1970-1971 tour (which preceded the studio recording) on 2005's \"The Word Is Live.\" The earliest known performances of \"America\" came from the band Clouds. In their earlier incarnation as 1-2-3, they had performed a re-written version of the song that included all the elements later used by Yes: changes in time signature, classical interludes, newly written segments etc. A live tape exists of this being performed at the Marquee in April 1967, prior to the release of any known recording by any artist, including the lyricist-composer, Paul Simon, himself. Simon had recorded demos at Levy studios in London in 1965, and tapes of these were passed to the band by a studio engineer (Stu Francis of Radio Luxembourg). In 1966, 1-2-3 also performed Sounds of Silence from this same tape. Folk Singer Bert Sommer, a member of the group the Left Banke, covered the song in the late 1960s, and he also performed the song at Woodstock in 1969. David Bowie performed a minimalist version of the song to open The Concert for New York City in October 2001. Bowie performed seated on the floor, center stage, with a microphone and a Suzuki Omnichord. Bowie was actually in attendance at the Marquee during 1967 when 1-2-3 (later Clouds) performed this song, and Bowie's New York performance is starkly similar to the quiet solo organ section in the 1-2-3 version. He was a friend of Billy Ritchie, the keyboard player/writer, and the band were also at the time, playing a song by a then-unknown David Bowie, \"I Dig Everything.\" American singer-songwriter Josh Groban recorded it on his live album, \"Live at the Greek\" (2003), and has performed the song live on multiple occasions, including a Howard Gilman Opera House for Brooklyn Academy of Music's celebration of Simon's music in 2008, and at the A Capitol Fourth concert in 2011. \"Paul Simon is one of my favorite artists and 'America' has always been a song I've loved,\" he once remarked. Vocalist Alyssa Graham replaces Simon's \"Kathy\" with \"Douglas\" in her version, the leadoff track on her 2008 album \"Echo.\" Lucy Wainwright Roche performs it, together with The Roches, on her 2010 album \"Lucy.\" The band America also released a recording of the song on their 2011 album \"Back Pages.\" The Swedish sister duo First Aid Kit performed the song in honor of Paul Simon at the 2012 Polar Music Prize award ceremony, which earned them a standing ovation from Paul Simon himself. On Black Friday of 2014, First Aid Kit released a 10\" single containing the song as the title track. The Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps of Canton, Ohio featured the song in their 2013 production, \"... to look for America.\" Traverse City, MI singer-songwriter Joshua Davis performed the song on April 13, 2015 on Season 8 of NBC's \"The Voice.\" Sting performs the song on a quarter size acoustic guitar live on stage on the Paul Simon with Sting tour. U2 has snippeted the song on multiple occasions during their 2015 and 2017 world tours."], "neg": ["Anglo-American music\nAnglo-American music Anglo-American music is derived from the English culture of the Thirteen Colonies of the United States and has been a founding influence for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs use the same music, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. Anglo-American songs can also be distinguished from British songs by having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music, dating back to colonial times, includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks (especially in New England) and murder. Folk heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry and Jesse James are also part of many songs. Folk dance of English origin include the square dance, descended from the European high society quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a \"caller\" instructing the dancers. Sea shanties are an important part of Anglo-American music.  The folklorist Alan Lomax described regional differences among rural Anglo-American musicians as included the relaxed and open-voiced northern vocal style and the pinched and nasal southern style, with the west exhibiting a mix of the two.

Sullivan\nTeresa A. Sullivan Teresa Ann \"Terry\" Sullivan (born July 9, 1949) is a retired American sociologist and university administrator. She previously served as the President of the University of Virginia, a position she served from August 1, 2010 until July 31, 2018. Teresa Sullivan was born on July 9, 1949. She received her undergraduate degree from Michigan State University's James Madison College, where she was asked to stay on as an intern in the office of the president by Clifton R. Wharton Jr., then the president. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. She joined the faculty of the University of Texas as an instructor in sociology. At Texas, she held a variety of academic and administrative posts, including the chair of the sociology department, vice provost, and vice president and dean of graduate studies. She then served as the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of Michigan. Sullivan has written or cowritten six books and over 80 scholarly articles in sociology. In 1990, she co-authored \"The Social Organization of Work\" with Randy Hodson, which was described as a \"pathbreaking textbook in the sociology of work\" by Daniel B. Cornfield. She is an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Sullivan was unanimously elected on January 11, 2010, and became the University's first female president on August 1, 2010. However, on June 10, 2012, it was announced to the University that Sullivan would step down from her position on August 15, 2012, after serving only two years of a five-year contract. Leaders of the university’s governing board decided to remove Sullivan, \"largely because of her unwillingness to consider dramatic program cuts in the face of dwindling resources and for her perceived reluctance to approach the school with the bottom-line mentality of a corporate chief executive\". Others presented the dispute as being more about differing views of the academic culture and future direction of the university than immediate financial concerns; whether less popular traditional-classical academic studies should be cut, with funding refocused on more profitable and business-oriented courses and programs. Later news reports presented the resignation as an \"ouster\" organized by Helen Dragas, rector of the university's Board of Visitors; with strong suggestions of Dragas' conflicting views of the future of the university, and personal ambitions playing a role in her actions. Although a formal meeting and vote of the full board was not held at the time, Sullivan was presented with the news of her loss of majority support within the board, and given the 'opportunity' to resign. The public announcement of her resignation was communicated via an email by Dragas on behalf of the Board of Visitors. The message quoted from Sullivan's resignation letter and cited \"philosophical differences\" on how the University was to be run. Large-scale protest against the action, and support for Sullivan from students, faculty, alumni, as well as the national academic community, resulted, including a faculty senate demand for the removal of the Board of Visitors leaders – Rector Helen Dragas and Vice Rector Mark J. Kington – and demands from the student government for an explanation for the ouster. In the face of this pressure, including a statement from Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell that he would remove the entire board if they failed to resolve the issue at their June 26 meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president. In January 2017, Sullivan announced her intention to retire effective September 30, 2018. She was succeeded by James Ryan on August 1, 2018  She is married to legal scholar Douglas Laycock.", "Virginia Gentlemen\nVirginia Gentlemen The Virginia Gentlemen (VGs) is a men's collegiate a cappella group and the oldest a cappella group at the University of Virginia. The group was founded in 1953 as an elite octet of the Virginia Glee Club. Since establishing independence from the Virginia Glee Club in 1987, the group has continued to perform a mix of contemporary pop and classic vocal music. Recognizable by the signature navy blue blazers and orange-and-blue bow ties worn during performances, the VGs offer regular performances across the Charlottesville area and the United States, and conduct annual international tours, having most recently travelled to Southeast Asia, South America, and North Africa. Additionally, the group has performed in recent years at the Sydney Opera House, the Forbidden City, the Grand Palace of Thailand, and at the White House for the Bush and Obama administrations. The Virginia Gentlemen were founded in 1953 and as such are the oldest a cappella group at the University of Virginia. The group was conceived as an elite octet of the Virginia Glee Club and would perform regularly at their concerts, eventually building enough of a reputation to attract its own audiences and perform its own shows. The group existed for over three decades as a subsidiary of the Glee Club until establishing itself as an contracted independent organization in 1987, under the leadership of then-music director Michael Butterman. Since the VGs' independence from the Virginia Glee Club, much changed with the group, the least of which being the group's membership size. From the Glee Club era size of 8 to 12 members, the group now stands regularly between 15 and 19 members per year. The group's musical tastes changed as well, diverging from the classical and barbershop chorus pieces of the Glee Club era to arrangements of modern pop singles and rock ballads that it performs and records today. The VGs maintain a close relationship with the University of Virginia and the city of Charlottesville, performing regularly on campus in concerts and for special occasions and memorials, including the vigil for Yeardley Love after her death. The group recorded its first album in 1988 with \"Live From the Studio\" and has since released 21 studio albums. The VGs most recent album release was in 2014 with \"Full Attire.\" Several Virginia Gentlemen arrangements have been featured on Best of College A Cappella compilations, including their renowned a cappella arrangement of the song \"Insomniac\" by Billy Pilgrim. The Virginia Gentlemen annually perform four concerts throughout the year, typically in Old Cabell Hall. The first of these concerts is the Family Weekend Concert held as part of the events organized for the University's Family Weekend in the middle of the Fall semester. The second is the Holiday Concert held in conjunction with the Virginia Sil'hooettes in December. The third of these is the Winter Classic held in February, which at times has also been held in conjunction with the Hullabahoos and the Academical Village People. The fourth concert of the year is the Spring Concert, held in April. The proceeds from one or more of these concerts is annually donated to charity. The VGs also perform annually at the Annual Christmas Concert of the Virginia Glee Club in honor of the two groups' long-standing relationship. Traditionally, when the Glee Club performs \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" the eighth day is sung by the VGs, an homage to the original octet which formed out of the Glee Club. The group has received requests to perform in several prestigious venues, including the White House, at which the group performed in 1991 for George H. W. Bush, in 2008 for George W. Bush, and in 2011, 2012, and 2013 for Barack Obama, including for the 2013 Presidential Inauguration. The group has travelled extensively since its independence, beginning with regular tours around the country and to the Caribbean in the early years of independence. For the last decade and a half, the group has travelled on an annual international tour, most recently visiting Argentina and Antarctica in January 2016. The Virginia Gentlemen have now traveled to all 7 continents, a feat that has been accomplished by very few performing groups. The Virginia Gentlemen's standard performance attire consists of khakis, blue blazers, and blue and orange bow ties (the UVA colors), for which members of the group are widely recognized around campus. Indeed, several of the a cappella groups founded at the University of Virginia after the Virginia Gentlemen established their identities in response to the formal look taken by the Virginia Gentlemen at concerts. However, the group does not perform exclusively in \"VG attire\" but has performed more informally as suited by the occasion. Over six decades, the Virginia Gentlemen have arranged and performed hundreds of songs, several of which have become group classics. These songs, performed many times annually and recognized by students at the University of Virginia as VG signatures, include \"Insomniac,\" by Billy Pilgrim, the group's most celebrated and acclaimed arrangement; \"On the Turning Away,\" by Pink Floyd, performed during some of the University's most difficult times; and \"Shenandoah,\" a Glee Club standard carried over from the groups' long history together. The first and last song that each Virginia Gentleman sings during his time in the group is \"Lonesome Road\", by James Taylor. At the close of each concert, the Virginia Gentlemen invite all past VGs onstage to join in its singing, and it serves as the final song on \"Gold\", the group's 50th Anniversary Album, released in 2003. Though the song is younger than the group, past members of the Virginia Gentlemen have since learned the arrangement and all members past and present perform the song together whenever the occasion arises.

Grant Broadcasting was founded in 1990 by Milton Grant (May 13, 1923 — April 28, 2007), who, in addition to being President of Grant Broadcasting, also served as President and General Manager for many of his stations. Milton Grant began his career as a radio news director in his hometown of New York City. In the early 1950s he moved to Washington, D.C., where he became the host of several music programs, one of which (America's First Teen Radio Network) was heard simultaneously on four of the city's radio stations, WPGC], WAVA, WINX, and WEEL. Grant moved to television in 1956 when he hosted a popular dance program for WTTG, \"The Milt Grant Show\", which ran until 1961. Grant's first foray into station ownership first came in 1966 when his new company, the Capitol Broadcasting Corporation, established WDCA-TV. That station was sold to the Superior Tube Company in 1969, but Grant remained with the station as its General Manager until WDCA was sold to Taft Broadcasting in 1979. In 1981, Grant was part of an investment group who launched KTXA in Fort Worth, Texas (in 1981) and KTXH in Houston (in 1982). Grant both sold stations to Gulf Broadcasting in 1985 and days later these two stations were sold in a group deal to Taft Broadcasting. In 1985, while preparing for the sale of KTXA and KTXH, Grant started the original Grant Broadcasting System, beginning with the sign-on of WBFS-TV in Miami in 1984, and later with the 1985 acquisitions of WGBO-TV in Joliet, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), and WGBS-TV in Philadelphia. However, in 1987, this first incarnation of Grant Broadcasting went bankrupt, after overpaying for syndicated programming, while its competitors took the best barter programming. It was even worse in Chicago, where all of WGBO's competitors took all the bartered shows available to them, leaving WGBO with holding the bag.  In 1989, Grant's stations were repossessed by its creditors after Grant failed to meet the bankruptcy agreements. The creditors used these stations to form \"Combined Broadcasting\" (no relation to the earlier \"Combined Communications\", which was merged into the Gannett Company in 1979). In 1990, Grant started to rebuild is broadcasting empire, under the name \"Grant Communications\", later renamed \"Grant Broadcasting System II\" (the \"II\" representing his second try to build a chain). His first station was Huntsville, Alabama's WZDX, which he acquired in March 1990. In 1996, Grant acquired Buffalo's WB affiliate, WNYO-TV (now affiliated with MyNetworkTV), but he later sold the station to Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2001.

The sale was completed on December 1, 2014. Grant Broadcasting stations used to share a distinctive logo style: even the original three Grant stations (WBFS, WGBO, and WGBS) used this style.

The station began broadcasting on 1 January 1937. Prior to that, a station owned by the Mockler Brothers, with the call sign 2MK, had existed in Bathurst, first broadcasting on 31 October 1925. 2BS was not always the intended call sign - 2BX was also considered. A station located at Meadow Lane, which was to serve both Bathurst and Lithgow, was also projected to start in 1925 with the call letters \"2LE\". That station never eventuated. In the 1950s it was discovered that 2BS's signal was interfering at night with the signal of Melbourne station 3AK. That forced 3AK to become a daytime-only station, having previously been an overnight station. The problem was fixed in the 1960s by switching to directional antennas, which led to 3AK commencing 24-hour transmission. At that time, Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) owned both stations. In 1969, ACP sold 2BS to Ron Camplin, who continues to own the station today. 2BS is an adult contemporary station with a prime target audience of 25+, playing music from the 1950s onwards.

{"query": "Precooler applications beyond SABRE rocket engine instead of SABRE engine function", "pos": ["Precooled jet engine\nPrecooled jet engine The precooled jet engine is a concept that enables jet engines with turbomachinery, as opposed to ramjets, to be used at high speeds. Precooling restores some or all of the performance degredation of the engine compressor (by preventing rotating stall/choking/reduced flow), as well as that of the complete gas generator (by maintainig a significant combustor temperature rise within a fixed turbine temperature limit), which would otherwise prevent flight with high ram temperatures. For higher flight speeds precooling may feature a cryogenic fuel-cooled heat exchanger before the air enters the compressor. After gaining heat and vapourising in the heat exchanger, the fuel (e.g. H) burns in the combustor. Precooling using a heat exchanger has not been used in flight, but is predicted to have significantly high thrust and efficiency at speeds up to Mach 5.5. Precooled jet engine cycles were analyzed by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955. Pre-cooled engines avoid the need for an air condenser because, unlike liquid air cycle engines (LACE), pre-cooled engines cool the air without liquefying it. For lower flight speeds precooling can be done with mass injection, known as WIPCC (water injection precompressor cooling) This method has been used for short duration (due to limited coolant capacity) increases to an aircraft's normal maximum speed. \"Operation Skyburner\", which gained a world speed record with a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, and the Mikoyan Ye-266 (Mig 25). both used a water/alcohol spray to cool the air ahead of the compressor. Precooling (as well as combustion chamber water injection) is used at the lowest flight speeds, ie during take off, to increase thrust at high ambient temperatures.  One main advantage of pre-cooling is (as predicted by the ideal gas law) for a given overall pressure ratio, there is a significant reduction in compressor delivery temperature (T3), which delays reaching the T3 limit to a higher Mach number. Consequently, sea-level conditions (corrected flow) can be maintained after the pre-cooler over a very wide range of flight speeds, thus maximizing net thrust even at high speeds. The compressor and ducting after the inlet is subject to much lower and more consistent temperatures, and hence may be made of light alloys. This reduces the weight of the engine, which further improves the thrust/weight ratio. Hydrogen is a suitable fuel because it is liquid at deeply cryogenic temperatures, and over its useful range has a very high total specific heat capacity, including the latent heat of vapourisation, higher than water. However, the low density of liquid hydrogen has negative effects on the rest of the vehicle, and the vehicle physically becomes very large, although the weight on the undercarriage and wing loading may remain low. Hydrogen causes structural weakening in many materials, known as hydrogen embrittlement. The weight of the precooler adds to the weight of the engine, thereby reducing its thrust to weight ratio. Passing the intake air through the precooler adds to the inlet drag, thereby reducing the engine net thrust, and so reducing the thrust to weight ratio. Depending on the amount of cooling required, despite its high thermal capacity, more hydrogen may be needed to cool the air than can be burnt with the cooled air. In some cases, part of the excess hydrogen can be burnt in a ramjet with uncooled air to reduce this inefficiency. Unlike a LACE engine, a precooled engine doesn't need to liquefy the oxygen, so the amount of cooling is reduced as there is no need to cover of fusion of the oxygen and a smaller total temperature drop is required. This in turn reduces the amount of hydrogen used as a heat-sink, but unable to be burnt. In addition a condenser isn't required, giving a weight saving. Robert P. Carmichael in 1955 devised several engine cycles that used liquid hydrogen to precool the inlet air to the engine before using it as fuel. Interest in precooled engines saw an emergence in the UK in 1982, when Alan Bond created a precooled air breathing rocket engine design he called SATAN. The idea was developed as part of the HOTOL SSTO spaceplane project, and became the Rolls-Royce RB545. In 1989, after the HOTOL project was discontinued, some of the RB545 engineers created a company, Reaction Engines Ltd, to develop the idea into the SABRE engine, and the associated Skylon spaceplane. In 1987, N Tanatsugu published \"Analytical Study of Space Plane Powered by Air-Turbo Ramjet with Intake Air Cooler.\" part of Japan's ISAS (now JAXA) study into an Air-Turbo Ramjet (ATR, later ATREX after the addition of an expander cycle) intended to power the first stage of a TSTO spaceplane.

Ice cubes are most commonly placed in it to help the contents inside stay cool. Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that stays cold longer than plain ice (absorbing heat as it changes phase).  Coolers are often taken on picnics, and on vacation or holiday. Where summers are hot, they may also be used just for getting cold groceries home from the store, such as keeping ice cream from melting in a hot automobile. Even without adding ice, this can be helpful, particularly if the trip home will be lengthy. Some coolers have built-in cupholders in the lid. They are usually made with interior and exterior shells of plastic, with a hard foam in between. They come in sizes from small personal ones to large family ones with wheels. Disposable ones are made solely from polystyrene foam (such as is a disposable coffee cup) about 2 cm or one inch thick. Most reusable ones have molded-in handles; a few have shoulder straps. The cooler has developed from just a means of keeping beverages cold into a mode of transportation with the ride-on cooler. A thermal bag or cooler bag is very similar in concept, but typically smaller and not rigid. The portable ice chest was invented by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. On February 24, 1951, Laramy filed an application with the United States Patent Office for a portable ice chest (Serial No. 212,573). The patent (#2,663,157) was issued December 22, 1953.  The Coleman Company popularized the cooler with its initial offering of a galvanized cooler in 1954. Three years later, Coleman developed a process to make a plastic liner for coolers and jugs.  Some modern coolers are thermoelectric, plugging into a car's cigarette lighter socket. Rather than using a compressor and refrigerant such as a refrigerator or other heat pump, these use the Peltier effect along with an external fan to draw away the heat. By reversing the current, this concept can also heat the contents instead of cooling them, useful for keeping meals hot from a drive-through, or even to keep items from freezing in severely cold climates. Thermoelectric coolers typically can drop the temperature by about 40 °F or 22 °C below ambient temperature, or can raise it by at least that much; this is really a function of the effectiveness of the box' thermal insulation. Some better units even have digital thermostat controls. They do draw a significant amount of power, however, and can drain a non running car's battery so much so that it cannot start. Most electric coolers have an undervoltage shutoff at around 10 or 10.5 volts to prevent this. Many come with power adapters, which use an electronic transformer to convert AC mains or line voltage down to 12 volts, with a lighter-like socket for the cooler's cord to plug in. Some also have a crossover-connection device to reverse the current for heating service. Rotationally molded (roto-molded) coolers have become popular in recent years. Roto-molded coolers are manufactured using a process called rotational molding, a process by which a heated and softened material is applied into a slowly rotating mold. The mold continues to rotate during the cooling phase, producing a thick and uniform final product. In the case of roto-molded coolers, the heated liquid plastic is applied over a thick layer of insulation. The resulting product has no seals or imperfections and is much stronger and more durable than traditional coolers. Examples of roto-molded coolers include YETI, ORCA or Grizzly coolers. A ride-on cooler is a means of transportation that can store and cool beverages and other food products. There are two main designs for the motor in the cooler: the electric motor, and the gas-powered lawnmower engine. The ride-on cooler is a combination of a low power, or small electric, engine with a go-cart frame which uses the cooler as a seat. Gas engine options include Briggs engines, OHV greyhound Harbor Freight engines, and Honda engines. These small engines can be very powerful, making them suitable for homeowners, recreational users, light-duty professional users, and even racing enthusiasts. The fastest ride-on coolers use modified racing cart engines that produce over and are capable of speeds exceeding . Another option is an electric motor ranging from . The electric motors can be lighter, more energy efficient, and quieter than most gas motors. Without the excess weight of the fuel tank and its contents, the electric-powered coolers can be lighter and silent. The frame also has two design styles: three wheels with a single steering wheel out front, or four wheels, as in the average go-cart. The steering column of a gas-powered ride-on cooler is very similar to that of a go-cart. One major difference is the position of the steering wheel. For the go-cart, the steering wheel is angled toward the driver, enabling him to sit lower to the ground and maintain control at higher speeds. For the ride-on cooler, the steering column is vertical because the seat is higher and the driver sits more vertical. The ride-on cooler has the ability to transport food and drinks short distances and can be used in a small backyard, a neighborhood, or at large outdoor parties. The ride-on cooler can be equipped with a trailer hitch, allowing it to tow an extra cooler as a trailer. The extra trailer has more holding capacity than the drivable cooler due to the lack of an engine. The electric ride-on coolers are advertised as being capable of holding 24 12-ounce cans and a bag of ice. The trailer can hold up to 72 of cans and a bag of ice. Larger gas-powered coolers are capable of carrying up to 72 drinks and of ice in the front cooler compartment. Both the gas and electric motors can have a wide range of power. The electric motors range from to and generally use 12- to 60-volt batteries. However, the gas-powered engines range from . The gas-powered Cruzin Cooler is advertised as having a top speed of and up to of travel on a single tank of gasoline. It holds up to , therefore, the mileage is . CoolerRacer.com builds a race version with a top speed of and a gas tank with enough capacity to last from several hours to all weekend, depending on the speed and terrain to which it is subjected. The size of the engine greatly affects the initial weight of the cooler. The smaller electric engines can weigh as little as , and the larger engine's unloaded weight can reach almost . Most of the ride-on coolers can support up to while still running at full capacity. The legal status of the ride-on cooler varies from country to country and in the US from state to state. In some jurisdictions, a driver license is required to operate any form of motor vehicle on public roads, and a driver can be convicted of driving under the influence for riding one."]}
{"query": "Roberto Matta surrealist paintings rather than influence on Valerio Adami", "pos": ["Roberto Matta\nRoberto Matta Roberto Sebastián Antonio Matta Echaurren (; November 11, 1911 – November 23, 2002), better known as Roberto Matta, was one of Chile's best-known painters and a seminal figure in 20th century abstract expressionist and surrealist art. Matta was of Spanish, Basque and French descent. Born in Santiago, he studied architecture and interior design at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago, and graduated in 1935. That spring, he journeyed from Peru to Panama and completed surreal drawings of many of the geographical features he witnessed. He first encountered Europe while serving in the Merchant Marine after graduating. His travels in Europe and the USA led him to meet artists such as Arshile Gorky, René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, André Breton, and Le Corbusier. It was Breton who provided the major spur to the Chilean's direction in art, encouraging his work and introducing him to the leading members of the Paris Surrealist movement. Matta produced illustrations and articles for Surrealist journals such as \"Minotaure\". During this period he was introduced to the work of many prominent contemporary European artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp. The first true flowering of Matta's own art came in 1938, when he moved from drawing to the oil painting for which he is best known. This period coincided with his emigration to the United States, where he lived until 1948. His early paintings, such as \"Invasion of the Night\", give an indication of the work he would continue, with diffuse light patterns and bold lines on a featureless background. This is also the period of the \"inscape\" series, and the closely related \"psychological morphologies\". Prof. Claude Cernuschi (see Boston College Matta exhibition external link below) writes, \"Matta's key ambition to represent and evoke the human psyche in visual form was filtered through the writings of Freud and the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'.\" According to the essay on Matta in \"Crosscurrents of Modernism\" (see references below), the inscapes' evocative forms \"are visual analogies for the artist's psyche\" (p. 241). During the 1940s and 1950s, the disturbing state of world politics found reflection in Matta's work, with the canvases becoming busy with images of electrical machinery and distressed figures. The addition of clay to Matta's paintings in the early 1960s lent an added dimension to the distortions. In his art Matta creates new dimensions in a blend of organic and cosmic lifeforms (see biomorphism). He was one of the first artists to take this abstract leap. Matta's connections with Breton's surrealist movement were severed following a private disagreement concerning Arshile Gorky and his family. Matta was accused of indirectly causing Gorky's suicide (in response to Matta's relationship with the Armenian-American painter's wife). This led to his expulsion from the group, but by this time Matta's own name was becoming widely known. He divided his life between Europe and South America during the 1950s and 1960s, successfully combining the political and the semi-abstract in epic surreal canvases. Matta believed that art and poetry can change lives, and was very involved in the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He was a strong supporter of the socialist government of president Salvador Allende in Chile. A 4x24 meter mural of his entitled \"The First Goal of the Chilean People\", was painted over with 16 coats of paint by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet following their violent overthrow of Salvador Allende in 1973. In 2005 the mural was discovered by local officials. In 2008 the mural was completely restored at a cost of $43,000, and is displayed today in Santiago at the La Granja city hall. Throughout his life, Matta worked with many different types of media, including ceramic, photography, and video production. Matta died in Civitavecchia, Italy on 23 November 2002. Matta was married twice: his first wife was Patricia Echaurren, an American (who later married Pierre Matisse), and his second wife was Germana Ferrari. He is the father of six children. Two died prematurely, leaving his creative legacy to artists Gordon Matta-Clark and his twin brother Sebastian, Ramuntcho Matta, Federica Matta, designer Alisée and writer Pablo Echaurren, whose surname was wrongly recorded at birth."], "neg": ["Eva and Franco Mattes\nEva and Franco Mattes Eva and Franco Mattes (both born in Italy in 1976) are a duo of artists based in New York City. Since meeting in Berlin in 1994, they have never separated. Operating under the pseudonym 0100101110101101.org, they are counted among the pioneers of the Net Art movement and are renowned for their subversion of public media. They produce art involving the ethical and political issues arising from the inception of the Internet. The work investigates the fabrication of situations, where fact and fiction merge into one. They are based in Brooklyn, New York, but also travel frequently throughout Europe and the United States. From 1995–97, the Mattes toured the world's most important museums in Europe and the United States, and stole 50 fragments from well-known works by artists such as Duchamp, Kandinsky, Beuys, and Rauschenberg. This work, titled \"Stolen Pieces\", exhibited the stolen fragments in glass cabinets: a porcelain piece of Duchamp's urinal, skin from an Alberto Burri painting, etc. They have manipulated video games, internet technologies and street advertising to reveal truths concealed by contemporary society. Their media facades were believable enough to elicit embarrassing reactions from governments, the public, and the art world. In addition, they have orchestrated several unpredictable mass performances, staged outside art spaces, and involved unwitting audiences in scenarios that mingle truth and falsehood to the point of being indistinguishable. Their off-the-wall performances—for which they have been sued multiple times—include affixing fake architectural heritage plaques (\"An Ordinary Building\", 2006), rolling out a media campaign for a non-existent action movie (\"United We Stand\", 2005) and even convincing the people of Vienna that Nike had purchased the city's historic Karlsplatz and was about to rename it \"Nikeplatz\" (\"Nike Ground\", 2003). Their art has been featured at the Biennale of Sydney (2016), Whitechapel Gallery, London (2016), Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2016), Minneapolis Institute of Art (2013), SITE Santa Fe (2012), Sundance Film Festival (2012), MoMA PS1, New York (2009), Performa, New York (2007, 2009), National Art Museum of China (2008), Collection Lambert, Avignon (2006), New Museum, New York (2005), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2001), Manifesta, Frankfurt (2002) and the Venice Biennale (2001). The couple first gained notoriety in 1998 by taking the domain name \"vaticano.org\", in order to undermine the Catholic Church's official website. They then went on a cloning spree, copying and remixing other artists' works, e.g., Jodi.org. They also targeted \"closed\" websites, such as Hell.com, thereby turning private art into public art. This activity is born out of their desire to create truly interactive works (as opposed to most net.art that they believe only poses as interactive). They define this in an interview with Jaka Zelenznikar where they discuss audiences reaching a website, regardless of it being the subject of net.art or not, and \"by their mouse clicks they choose one of the routes fixed by the author(s), they only decide what to see before and what after\". They argue that this is not true interactivity and compare it to a gallery space, suggesting that it too could be called interactive since one is able to decide what room to look at and when. Their definition of interactivity is more associated with the freedom the user has to not only govern their own movements but to duplicate, manipulate and simulate the subject matter. This includes doing something that is not predicted by the author of the website, \"the beholder becomes an artist and the artist becomes a beholder: a powerless witness of what happens to his work.\" Their 2010 work, \"No Fun\" epitomizes the sentiment in the previous quote because it utilizes the social networking and video chat website Chatroulette to exhibit Franco Mattes staging a false suicide (hanging) in part of the screen and people's responses to it in other parts of the screen. Another example of their work, where the audience is the subject, is \"Emily's video\" (2012) where they invited volunteers to watch what they called \"the worst video ever,\" combined of clips from the Darknet. The viewers were filmed whilst watching it and the original video was destroyed. What remains are the reactions of the viewers, recorded on webcams. When displayed in a gallery setting the monitor is positioned on its side with the reaction playing on the top half while the bottom section remains black. This space is where the original video would be positioned and also allows for the live audience to catch their reflection. The work is also set up to face away from the gallery's entrance in order to enable new visitors to first see the reactions of the live audience before watching the ones on the screen. The Mattes shocked the mainstream art world with the invention of \"Darko Maver\", a reclusive radical artist, who achieved cult status and was paid tribute to in the 48th Venice Biennale, before being exposed as pure fiction. The fiction was that this Serbian artist created very gruesome and realistic models of murder victims and positioned them so to obtain media attention. He was exposing the brutality of war in the Balkans to the world. The 'reality' was that the documentary photos of his artworks were photographs of real life atrocities found on rotten.com. They mutated reality to mimic fiction but in doing so produced an alternative reality. Their message to the world was: while artists are making shocking artwork, absorbed by the market, real violence is being perpetrated and ignored by a media-anesthetized world. There are also clear parallels between the invention of this character and the fabrication of reasons to instigate a war; from a 'suspected' terrorist attack to a message from God. Eva and Franco produced several works employing the video game Second Life. The first of these being the series titled \"Portraits\", photographs taken of avatars in the game printed onto canvas. In an interview with Domenico Quaranta they explained that they \"see Avatars as 'self-portraits'. Unlike most portraits, though, they are not based on the way you 'are', but rather on the way you 'want to be'. Actually, our works are not portraits, but rather 'pictures of self-portraits'.\" The Mattes wanted to stress that our culture revolves around plagiarism. They followed up by saying that their project was not a completely original piece. In fact, they stated that anyone who claims that their work is an original, should really \"start doubting\" their mental health, because practically everything in this world, not just art, is a reproduction or remix of something that has been released before. One of these portraits went on to be destroyed by a young artist at the MAMbo Museum, Bologna. He was reportedly a fan of their work but not the prints. The, now destroyed, portrait has become a new work, 'Killing Zoe', another edition to their attempts to debunk originality; this has only become something new due it being a part of a new event, all the subject matter is the same but it comes in a new form. Inviting other members of Second Life to participate or watch, the Mattes created \"Synthetic Performances\". Before scripting their own performances, in 2007 they started out with \"Reenactments\" of historical performances: \"Marina Abramović's Imponderabilia\", \"Gilbert&George's The Singing Sculpture\", \"Valie Export's Tapp und Tastkino\", \"Vito Acconci's Seedbed\" and \"Chris Burden's Shoot\"."]}
{"query": "Structure Preservation Principle applications in computational linguistics instead of theoretical syntax", "pos": ["Treebank\nTreebank In linguistics, a treebank is a parsed text corpus that annotates syntactic or semantic sentence structure. The construction of parsed corpora in the early 1990s revolutionized computational linguistics, which benefitted from large-scale empirical data. The exploitation of treebank data has been important ever since the first large-scale treebank, The Penn Treebank, was published. However, although originating in computational linguistics, the value of treebanks is becoming more widely appreciated in linguistics research as a whole. For example, annotated treebank data has been crucial in syntactic research to test linguistic theories of sentence structure against large quantities of naturally occurring examples. The term \"treebank\" was coined by linguist Geoffrey Leech in the 1980s, by analogy to other repositories such as a seedbank or bloodbank. This is because both syntactic and semantic structure are commonly represented compositionally as a tree structure. The term \"parsed corpus\" is often used interchangeably with the term treebank, with the emphasis on the primacy of sentences rather than trees. Treebanks are often created on top of a corpus that has already been annotated with part-of-speech tags. In turn, treebanks are sometimes enhanced with semantic or other linguistic information. Treebanks can be created completely manually, where linguists annotate each sentence with syntactic structure, or semi-automatically, where a parser assigns some syntactic structure which linguists then check and, if necessary, correct. In practice, fully checking and completing the parsing of natural language corpora is a labour-intensive project that can take teams of graduate linguists several years. The level of annotation detail and the breadth of the linguistic sample determine the difficulty of the task and the length of time required to build a treebank. Some treebanks follow a specific linguistic theory in their syntactic annotation (e.g. the BulTreeBank follows HPSG) but most try to be less theory-specific. However, two main groups can be distinguished: treebanks that annotate phrase structure (for example the Penn Treebank or ICE-GB) and those that annotate dependency structure (for example the Prague Dependency Treebank or the Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank). It is important to clarify the distinction between the formal representation and the file format used to store the annotated data. Treebanks are necessarily constructed according to a particular grammar. The same grammar may be implemented by different file formats. For example, the syntactic analysis for \"John loves Mary\", shown in the figure on the right, may be represented by simple labelled brackets in a text file, like this (following the Penn Treebank notation): This type of representation is popular because it is light on resources, and the tree structure is relatively easy to read without software tools. However, as corpora become increasingly complex, other file formats may be preferred. Alternatives include treebank-specific XML schemes, numbered indentation and various types of standoff notation. From a computational perspective, treebanks have been used to engineer state-of-the-art natural language processing systems such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, semantic analyzers and machine translation systems. Most computational systems utilize gold-standard treebank data. However, an automatically parsed corpus that is not corrected by human linguists can still be useful. It can provide evidence of rule frequency for a parser. A parser may be improved by applying it to large amounts of text and gathering rule frequencies. However, it should be obvious that only by a process of correcting and completing a corpus by hand is it possible then to identify rules absent from the parser knowledge base. In addition, frequencies are likely to be more accurate. In corpus linguistics, treebanks are used to study syntactic phenomena (for example, diachronic corpora can be used to study the time course of syntactic change). Once parsed, a corpus will contain frequency evidence showing how common different grammatical structures are in use. Treebanks also provide evidence of coverage and support the discovery of new, unanticipated, grammatical phenomena. Another use of treebanks in theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics is interaction evidence. A completed treebank can help linguists carry out experiments as to how the decision to use one grammatical construction tends to influence the decision to form others, and to try to understand how speakers and writers make decisions as they form sentences. Interaction research is particularly fruitful as further layers of annotation, e.g. semantic, pragmatic, are added to a corpus. It is then possible to evaluate the impact of non-syntactic phenomena on grammatical choices. A semantic treebank is a collection of natural language sentences annotated with a meaning representation. These resources use a formal representation of each sentence's semantic structure. Semantic treebanks vary in the depth of their semantic representation. A notable example of deep semantic annotation is the Groningen Meaning Bank, developed at the University of Groningen and annotated using Discourse Representation Theory. An example of a shallow semantic treebank is PropBank, which provides annotation of verbal propositions and their arguments, without attempting to represent every word in the corpus in logical form.  A deep syntax treebank is a treebank lying at the interface between syntax and semantics, where the representation structure can be interpreted as a graph, representing subject of infinitival phrases, extraction, it-clef construction, shared subject ellipsis and so on. (to extend)  Many syntactic treebanks have been developed for a wide variety of languages: To facilitate the further researches between multilingual tasks, some researchers discussed the universal annotation scheme for cross-languages. In this way, people try to utilize or merge the advantages of different treebanks corpora. For instance,  The universal annotation approach for dependency treebanks; and the universal annotation approach for phrase structure treebanks. One of the key ways to extract evidence from a treebank is through search tools. Search tools for parsed corpora typically depend on the annotation scheme that was applied to the corpus. User interfaces range in sophistication from expression-based query systems aimed at computer programmers to full exploration environments aimed at general linguists. Wallis (2008) discusses the principles of searching treebanks in detail and reviews the state of the art."], "neg": ["Computational linguistics\nComputational linguistics Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions. Traditionally, computational linguistics was performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. Today, computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, which can include regular linguists, experts in the target language, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others. Computational linguistics has theoretical and applied components. Theoretical computational linguistics focuses on issues in theoretical linguistics and cognitive science, and applied computational linguistics focuses on the practical outcome of modeling human language use. The Association for Computational Linguistics defines computational linguistics as: Computational linguistics is often grouped within the field of artificial intelligence, but actually was present before the development of artificial intelligence. Computational linguistics originated with efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English. Since computers can make arithmetic calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was thought to be only a short matter of time before they could also begin to process language. Computational and quantitative methods are also used historically in attempted reconstruction of earlier forms of modern languages and subgrouping modern languages into language families. Earlier methods such as lexicostatistics and glottochronology have been proven to be premature and inaccurate. However, recent interdisciplinary studies which borrow concepts from biological studies, especially gene mapping, have proved to produce more sophisticated analytical tools and more trustworthy results. When machine translation (also known as mechanical translation) failed to yield accurate translations right away, automated processing of human languages was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed. Computational linguistics was born as the name of the new field of study devoted to developing algorithms and software for intelligently processing language data. The term \"computational linguistics\" itself was first coined by David Hays, founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics. When artificial intelligence came into existence in the 1960s, the field of computational linguistics became that sub-division of artificial intelligence dealing with human-level comprehension and production of natural languages. In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the grammar of both languages, including both morphology (the grammar of word forms) and syntax (the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the semantics and the lexicon (or 'vocabulary'), and even something of the pragmatics of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers. Nowadays research within the scope of computational linguistics is done at computational linguistics departments, computational linguistics laboratories, computer science departments, and linguistics departments.  Some research in the field of computational linguistics aims to create working speech or text processing systems while others aim to create a system allowing human-machine interaction. Programs meant for human-machine communication are called conversational agents. Just as computational linguistics can be performed by experts in a variety of fields and through a wide assortment of departments, so too can the research fields broach a diverse range of topics. The following sections discuss some of the literature available across the entire field broken into four main area of discourse: developmental linguistics, structural linguistics, linguistic production, and linguistic comprehension. Language is a cognitive skill which develops throughout the life of an individual. This developmental process has been examined using a number of techniques, and a computational approach is one of them. Human language development does provide some constraints which make it harder to apply a computational method to understanding it. For instance, during language acquisition, human children are largely only exposed to positive evidence. This means that during the linguistic development of an individual, only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and not evidence for what is not correct. This is insufficient information for a simple hypothesis testing procedure for information as complex as language, and so provides certain boundaries for a computational approach to modeling language development and acquisition in an individual. Attempts have been made to model the developmental process of language acquisition in children from a computational angle, leading to both statistical grammars and connectionist models. Work in this realm has also been proposed as a method to explain the evolution of language through history. Using models, it has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span. This was simultaneously posed as a reason for the long developmental period of human children. Both conclusions were drawn because of the strength of the artificial neural network which the project created. The ability of infants to develop language has also been modeled using robots in order to test linguistic theories. Enabled to learn as children might, a model was created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words. Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure, vastly simplifying the learning process and shedding light on information which furthers the current understanding of linguistic development. It is important to note that this information could only have been empirically tested using a computational approach. As our understanding of the linguistic development of an individual within a lifetime is continually improved using neural networks and learning robotic systems, it is also important to keep in mind that languages themselves change and develop through time. Computational approaches to understanding this phenomenon have unearthed very interesting information. Using the Price Equation and Pólya urn dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution, but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modern-day languages. This modeling effort achieved, through computational linguistics, what would otherwise have been impossible. It is clear that the understanding of linguistic development in humans as well as throughout evolutionary time has been fantastically improved because of advances in computational linguistics. The ability to model and modify systems at will affords science an ethical method of testing hypotheses that would otherwise be intractable. In order to create better computational models of language, an understanding of language’s structure is crucial. To this end, the English language has been meticulously studied using computational approaches to better understand how the language works on a structural level. One of the most important pieces of being able to study linguistic structure is the availability of large linguistic corpora, or samples. This grants computational linguists the raw data necessary to run their models and gain a better understanding of the underlying structures present in the vast amount of data which is contained in any single language. One of the most cited English linguistic corpora is the Penn Treebank. Derived from widely-different sources, such as IBM computer manuals and transcribed telephone conversations, this corpus contains over 4.5 million words of American English. This corpus has been primarily annotated using part-of-speech tagging and syntactic bracketing and has yielded substantial empirical observations related to language structure. Theoretical approaches to the structure of languages have also been developed. These works allow computational linguistics to have a framework within which to work out hypotheses that will further the understanding of the language in a myriad of ways. One of the original theoretical theses on internalization of grammar and structure of language proposed two types of models. In these models, rules or patterns learned increase in strength with the frequency of their encounter. The work also created a question for computational linguists to answer: how does an infant learn a specific and non-normal grammar (Chomsky Normal Form) without learning an overgeneralized version and getting stuck? Theoretical efforts like these set the direction for research to go early in the lifetime of a field of study, and are crucial to the growth of the field. Structural information about languages allows for the discovery and implementation of similarity recognition between pairs of text utterances. For instance, it has recently been proven that based on the structural information present in patterns of human discourse, conceptual recurrence plots can be used to model and visualize trends in data and create reliable measures of similarity between natural textual utterances. This technique is a strong tool for further probing the structure of human discourse. Without the computational approach to this question, the vastly complex information present in discourse data would have remained inaccessible to scientists. Information regarding the structural data of a language is available for English as well as other languages, such as Japanese. Using computational methods, Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of log-normality was found in relation to sentence length. Though the exact cause of this lognormality remains unknown, it is precisely this sort of intriguing information which computational linguistics is designed to uncover. This information could lead to further important discoveries regarding the underlying structure of Japanese, and could have any number of effects on the understanding of Japanese as a language. Computational linguistics allows for very exciting additions to the scientific knowledge base to happen quickly and with very little room for doubt. Without a computational approach to the structure of linguistic data, much of the information that is available now would still be hidden under the vastness of data within any single language. Computational linguistics allows scientists to parse huge amounts of data reliably and efficiently, creating the possibility for discoveries unlike any seen in most other approaches. The production of language is equally as complex in the information it provides and the necessary skills which a fluent producer must have. That is to say, comprehension is only half the problem of communication. The other half is how a system produces language, and computational linguistics has made some very interesting discoveries in this area. In a now famous paper published in 1950 Alan Turing proposed the possibility that machines might one day have the ability to \"think\". As a thought experiment for what might define the concept of thought in machines, he proposed an \"imitation test\" in which a human subject has two text-only conversations, one with a fellow human and another with a machine attempting to respond like a human. Turing proposes that if the subject cannot tell the difference between the human and the machine, it may be concluded that the machine is capable of thought. Today this test is known as the Turing test and it remains an influential idea in the area of artificial intelligence. Some projects are still trying to solve the problem which first started computational linguistics off as its own field in the first place. However, the methods have become more refined and clever, and consequently the results generated by computational linguists have become more enlightening. In an effort to improve computer translation, several models have been compared, including hidden Markov models, smoothing techniques, and the specific refinements of those to apply them to verb translation. The model which was found to produce the most natural translations of German and French words was a refined alignment model with a first-order dependence and a fertility model[16]. They also provide efficient training algorithms for the models presented, which can give other scientists the ability to improve further on their results. This type of work is specific to computational linguistics, and has applications which could vastly improve understanding of how language is produced and comprehended by computers. Work has also been done in making computers produce language in a more naturalistic manner. Using linguistic input from humans, algorithms have been constructed which are able to modify a system's style of production based on a factor such as linguistic input from a human, or more abstract factors like politeness or any of the five main dimensions of personality. This work takes a computational approach via parameter estimation models to categorize the vast array of linguistic styles we see across individuals and simplify it for a computer to work in the same way, making human-computer interaction much more natural. Many of the earliest and simplest models of human-computer interaction, such as ELIZA for example, involve a text-based input from the user to generate a response from the computer. By this method, words typed by a user trigger the computer to recognize specific patterns and reply accordingly, through a process known as keyword spotting. Recent technologies have placed more of an emphasis on speech-based interactive systems. These systems, such as Siri of the iOS operating system, operate on a similar pattern-recognizing technique as that of text-based systems, but with the former, the user input is conducted through speech recognition. This branch of linguistics involves the processing of the user's speech as sound waves and the interpreting of the acoustics and language patterns in order for the computer to recognize the input. Much of the focus of modern computational linguistics is on comprehension. With the proliferation of the internet and the abundance of easily accessible written human language, the ability to create a program capable of understanding human language would have many broad and exciting possibilities, including improved search engines, automated customer service, and online education. Early work in comprehension included applying Bayesian statistics to the task of optical character recognition, as illustrated by Bledsoe and Browing in 1959 in which a large dictionary of possible letters were generated by \"learning\" from example letters and then the probability that any one of those learned examples matched the new input was combined to make a final decision. Other attempts at applying Bayesian statistics to language analysis included the work of Mosteller and Wallace (1963) in which an analysis of the words used in \"The Federalist Papers\" was used to attempt to determine their authorship (concluding that Madison most likely authored the majority of the papers). In 1971 Terry Winograd developed an early natural language processing engine capable of interpreting naturally written commands within a simple rule governed environment. The primary language parsing program in this project was called SHRDLU, which was capable of carrying out a somewhat natural conversation with the user giving it commands, but only within the scope of the toy environment designed for the task. This environment consisted of different shaped and colored blocks, and SHRDLU was capable of interpreting commands such as \"Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box.\" and asking questions such as \"I don't understand which pyramid you mean.\" in response to the user's input. While impressive, this kind of natural language processing has proven much more difficult outside the limited scope of the toy environment. Similarly a project developed by NASA called LUNAR was designed to provide answers to naturally written questions about the geological analysis of lunar rocks returned by the Apollo missions. These kinds of problems are referred to as question answering. Initial attempts at understanding spoken language were based on work done in the 1960s and 1970s in signal modeling where an unknown signal is analyzed to look for patterns and to make predictions based on its history. An initial and somewhat successful approach to applying this kind of signal modeling to language was achieved with the use of hidden Markov models as detailed by Rabiner in 1989. This approach attempts to determine probabilities for the arbitrary number of models that could be being used in generating speech as well as modeling the probabilities for various words generated from each of these possible models. Similar approaches were employed in early speech recognition attempts starting in the late 70s at IBM using word/part-of-speech pair probabilities. More recently these kinds of statistical approaches have been applied to more difficult tasks such as topic identification using Bayesian parameter estimation to infer topic probabilities in text documents. Modern computational linguistics is often a combination of studies in computer science and programming, math, particularly statistics, language structures, and natural language processing. Combined, these fields most often lead to the development of systems that can recognize speech and perform some task based on that speech. Examples include speech recognition software, such as Apple's Siri feature, spellcheck tools, speech synthesis programs, which are often used to demonstrate pronunciation or help the disabled, and machine translation programs and websites, such as Google Translate. Computational linguistics can be especially helpful in situations involving social media and the Internet. For example, filters in chatrooms or on website searches require computational linguistics. Chat operators often use filters to identify certain words or phrases and deem them inappropriate so that users cannot submit them. Another example of using filters is on websites. Schools use filters so that websites with certain keywords are blocked from children to view. There are also many programs in which parents use Parental controls to put content filters in place. Computational linguists can also develop programs that group and organize content through Social media mining. An example of this is Twitter, in which programs can group tweets by subject or keywords. Computational linguistics is also used for document retrieval and clustering. When you do an online search, documents and websites are retrieved based on the frequency of unique labels related to what you typed into a search engine. For instance, if you search \"red, large, four-wheeled vehicle,\" with the intention of finding pictures of a red truck, the search engine will still find the information desired by matching words such as \"four-wheeled\" with \"car\". Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (recognition) or synthesizing language (generation). Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages. The possibility of automatic language translation, however, has yet to be realized and remains a notoriously hard branch of computational linguistics. Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include: The subject of computational linguistics has had a recurring impact on popular culture:", "Persistence (linguistics)\nPersistence (linguistics) Persistence in linguistics refers to one of the five principles by which grammaticalisation can be detected while it is taking place. The other four are: layering, divergence, specialisation, and de-categorialisation. \"When a form undergoes grammaticalization from a lexical to a grammatical function, as long as it is grammatically viable some traces of its original lexical meanings tend to adhere to it, and details of its lexical history may be reflected in constraints on its grammatical distribution.\" (Hopper 1991: 22) \"The principle of persistence relates the meaning and function of a grammatical form to its history as a lexical morpheme. This relationship is often completely opaque by the stage of morphologisation, but during intermediate stages it may be expected that a form will be polysemous, and that one or more of its meaning will reflect a dominant earlier meaning.\" (Hopper 1991: 28) In other words, grammaticalisation can be a 'diachronic' explanatory parameter for certain otherwise hard-to-explain 'synchronic' (semantic and distributional) properties of grammatical signs. The lexical roots of a grammaticalised feature may remain visible in its grammatical function and may influence its grammatical distribution.", "Computational semantics\nComputational semantics Computational semantics is the study of how to automate the process of constructing and reasoning with meaning representations of natural language expressions. It consequently plays an important role in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Some traditional topics of interest are: construction of meaning representations, semantic underspecification, anaphora resolution, presupposition projection, and quantifier scope resolution. Methods employed usually draw from formal semantics or statistical semantics. Computational semantics has points of contact with the areas of lexical semantics (word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling), discourse semantics, knowledge representation and automated reasoning (in particular, automated theorem proving). Since 1999 there has been an ACL special interest group on computational semantics, SIGSEM.", "Structural linguistics\nStructural linguistics Structural linguistics is an approach to linguistics originating from the work of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure and is part of the overall approach of structuralism. Structural linguistics involves collecting a corpus of utterances and then attempting to classify all of the elements of the corpus at their different linguistic levels: the phonemes, morphemes, lexical categories, noun phrases, verb phrases, and sentence types.  Saussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\", published posthumously in 1916, stressed examining language as a static system of interconnected units. He is thus known as a father of modern linguistics for bringing about the shift from diachronic (historical) to synchronic (non-historical) analysis, as well as for introducing several basic dimensions of semiotic analysis that are still important today. Two of these are his key methods of syntagmatic and paradigmatic analysis (or 'associations' as Saussure was still calling them), which define units syntactically and lexically, respectively, according to their contrast with the other units in the system. Structural linguistics begins with the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\" in 1916, which was compiled from lectures by his students. The book proved to be highly influential, providing the foundation for both modern linguistics and semiotics. Structuralist linguistics is normally seen as giving rise to independent European and American traditions. In Europe, Saussure influenced: (1) the Geneva School of Albert Sechehaye and Charles Bally, (2) the Prague School of Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy, whose work would prove hugely influential, particularly concerning phonology, (3) the Copenhagen School of Louis Hjelmslev, and (4) the Paris School of Algirdas Julien Greimas. Structural linguistics also had an influence on other disciplines in Europe, including anthropology, psychoanalysis and Marxism, bringing about the movement known as structuralism. First, in America, linguist Leonard Bloomfield's reading of Saussure's course proved influential, bringing about the Bloomfieldean phase in American linguistics that lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Bloomfield \"bracketed\" all questions of semantics and meaning as largely unanswerable, and encouraged a mechanistic approach to linguistics. Those working in more or less the tradition of Bloomfield included Charles Hockett, Robert A. Hall, Jr., and Zellig Harris. Bloomfieldean linguistics in America was challenged by generative grammar, initially articulated in the publication of Noam Chomsky's \"Syntactic Structures\" in 1957. The foundation of structural linguistics is a \"sign\", which in turn has two components: a \"signified\" is an idea or concept, while the \"signifier\" is a means of expressing the signified. The \"sign\" is thus the combined association of signifier and signified. Signs can be defined only by being placed in contrast with other signs, which forms the basis of what later became the paradigmatic dimension of semiotic organization (i.e., collections of terms/entities that stand in opposition). This idea contrasted drastically with the idea that signs can be examined in isolation from a language and stressed Saussure's point that linguistics must treat language synchronically. Paradigmatic relations hold among sets of units that (in the early Saussurian renditions) exist in the mind, such as the set distinguished phonologically by variation in their initial sound \"cat, bat, hat, mat, fat\", or the morphologically distinguished set \"ran, run, running\". The units of a set must have something in common with one another, but they must contrast too, otherwise they could not be distinguished from each other and would collapse into a single unit, which could not constitute a set on its own, since a set always consists of more than one unit. Syntagmatic relations, in contrast, are concerned with how units, once selected from their paradigmatic sets of oppositions, are 'chained' together into structural wholes. One further common confusion here is that syntagmatic relations, assumed to occur in time, are anchored in speech and are considered either diachronic (confusing syntagmatic with historical) or are part of parole (\"everyday speech\": confusing syntagmatic with performance and behaviour and divorcing it from the linguistic system), or both. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic organizations both belong to the abstract system of language \"langue\" (French for \"Language;\" or an abstract, Platonic ideal). Different linguistic theories place different weight on the study of these dimensions: all structural and generative accounts, for example, pursue primarily characterisations of the syntagmatic dimension of the language system (syntax), while functional approaches, such as systemic linguistics, focus on the paradigmatic. Both dimensions need to be appropriately included, however. Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations provide the structural linguist with a tool for categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs \"cat\" and \"cats\" are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of \"cat\". Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an \"S\" to the end of the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma (\"I should\") and (\"Should I?\") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take syntagmatic evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of paradigmatic relations (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for syntagmatic configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of systemic functional grammar, where paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as head-driven phrase structure grammar, similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization. Saussure developed structural linguistics, with its idealized vision of language, partly because he was aware that it was impossible in his time to fully understand how the human brain and mind created and related to language:  Those working in the generativist tradition often regard Structuralist approaches as outdated and superseded. For example, Mitchell Marcus writes that structural linguistics was \"fundamentally inadequate to process the full range of natural language\". Holland writes that Chomsky had \"decisively refuted Saussure\". Similar views have been expressed by Jan Koster, Mark Turner, and others. Others however stress the continuing importance of Saussure's thought and Structuralist approaches. In 2012, Gilbert Lazard dismissed the Chomskyan approach as passé while applauding a return to Saussurrean structuralism as the only course by which linguistics can become more scientific. Matthews (2001) notes the existence of many \"linguists who are structuralists by many of the definitions that have been proposed, but who would themselves vigorously deny that they are anything of the kind\", suggesting a persistence of the structuralist paradigm. In the 1950s Saussure's ideas were appropriated by several prominent figures in Continental philosophy, anthropology, and from there were borrowed in literary theory, where they are used to interpret novels and other texts. However, several critics have charged that Saussure's ideas have been misunderstood or deliberately distorted by continental philosophers and literary theorists and are certainly not directly applicable to the textual level, which Saussure himself would have firmly placed within parole and so not amenable to his theoretical constructs."]}

By the 1990s the company had grown into a fashion empire that was producing a multimillion-dollar turnover from 200 stores and nineteen women and men's fashion labels. In 1994, David Bardas, lost control of the group when the banks moved to secure the assets that underpinned their outstanding loans. Prime among these was the expensive Sportsgirl Centre in Collins Street, which had put the group under intense financial strain. As a result, a South African company, Truworths, was able to buy 90 per cent of the group. However, by 1999 declining sales and growing losses resulted in Truworths ceasing funding of the business. The company was put into voluntary administration in November that year. The core retail brands, Sportscraft, Sportsgirl and David Lawrence were sold individually in 2000 to respectively, Apparel Group, Sussan Corporation and Webster Holdings."]}

He acquired such fame that he was made court painter and - uniquely - made a member of the Order of Santiago, which then excluded all painters and other manual labourers. The most successful of his portraits of the king is the painting officially entitled \"The family of Philip IV\" - better known as \"Las Meninas\" - showing a typical scene in a mid-16th-century court. The king and his second wife Mariana of Austria are shown reflected in a mirror in the work. It is Velázquez's best-known work, a symbol of his whole oeuvre, and has gradually come to be recognised as a masterpiece of Spanish art. The majority of Velazquez's paintings of the king and his relatives and nobles originally adorned the Palacio del Buen Retiro then, on its fall, moved to the Prado. Other royal subjects of his included Philip's first wife Elisabeth of France and their son Balthasar Charles, as well as Gaspar de Guzmán y Pimentel along with the infantes Carlos and Fernando de Austria, Philip's younger brothers.

(which resulted from the merger of \"Winthrop Chemical Company Inc.\" and \"Frederick Stearns & Company\"). It was formerly known as \"Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals\", whose primary product lines included diagnostic imaging agents, hormonal products, cardiovascular products, analgesics, antihistamines and muscle relaxants. Chemical compounds produced by this company were often known by their manufacturing code which consisted of the abbreviation WIN (for Winthrop) followed by a number. For example, WIN 18,320 was nalidixic acid, the first quinolone antibiotic. The Company was established in 1901 (then called \"Neuralgyline Co.\") in Wheeling, West Virginia, by Albert H. Diebold and William E. Weiss, a pharmacist. At the end of World War I in 1918, Sterling purchased the US assets of a German company now known as Bayer AG for US $5.3 million. This purchase was directed under the Alien Property Custodian Act. In 1919, Sterling sold its dye division for $2.5 million to the \"Grasselli Chemical Company\" (based in Linden, New Jersey), which employed many former Bayer personnel. A 1920 agreement between Sterling and Bayer AG granted Sterling the rights to the \"Bayer\" brand to sell aspirin. In return, Bayer was allowed back into its former Latin American markets. In 1922, 50% of Sterling's new holding company, \"Winthrop\", was given to the German Bayer company, while the American Bayer retained the rights to use Bayer brand. In 1923 Sterling purchased a 25% interest in The Centaur Company, manufacturer of Charles Henry Fletcher's, Fletcher's Castoria In 1940, a cross-contamination from equipment sharing resulted in Winthrop Chemical producing contaminated sulfathiazole tablets contaminated with phenobarbital. Each sulfathiazole tablet was contaminated with about 350 mg of phenobarbital. An investigation by US Food and Drug Administration and the findings resulted in actions. The incident was influential in the introduction of Good Manufacturing Practices for drugs. In 1967, Sterling Drug acquired Lehn & Fink, the makers of Lysol, Resolve, and d-CON. In 1974, Sterling opened a manufacturing plant in McPherson, Kansas. The various companies which would eventually acquire Sterling chose to keep the factory open. In 1988, Sterling was acquired by Eastman Kodak for $5.1 billion. In 1993, Eastman Kodak/Sterling Winthrop partnered with a French pharmaceutical company Elf Sanofi (now known as Sanofi Aventis). In June 1994, Eastman Kodak sold the prescription drug business of its Sterling Winthrop subsidiary to Sanofi for US $1.675 billion and the return of Kodak's minority stake in Sterling Health Europe. A week later, Sanofi announced that it was not interested in the diagnostic imaging business, which it sold to the Norwegian company Hafslund Nycomed AS for US$450 million. In August 1994, Kodak sold the remainder of Sterling Winthrop, including its over the counter drug business which had been generating about $1 billion in revenue annually, to the British firm SmithKline Beecham for US $2.925 billion cash. Bayer was a losing bidder for the purchase of Sterling Winthrop, but in September 1994, it purchased the over the counter division of Sterling Winthrop in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico from SmithKline Beecham for $1 billion. Bayer also re-acquired the brand rights to the \"Bayer Aspirin\" name it had lost because of World War I. Spinoffs from the sale of Sterling include Starwin Products, created in 1987 from Sterling’s original branch in Ghana.

Wolfe is an American physician and the co-founder and director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer and health advocacy lobbying organization. He has publicly crusaded against many pharmaceutical drugs, which he and his organization believe to be a danger to public health. After earning his medical degree at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, Wolfe completed an internship and residency in internal medicine. Beginning in 1966 he did research on aspects of blood-clotting and alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health. He met consumer advocate Ralph Nader in Washington, D.C. at a meeting of the American Patients Association, began advising Nader on health problems in the United States, and helped in the recruitment of medical student volunteers who worked for Nader. Wolfe co-founded the consumer lobbying organization Health Research Group with Nader in 1971 and has been its Director ever since. Since 1995 he has been an Adjunct Professor of Internal Medicine at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. For more than 30 years, Wolfe campaigned to have propoxyphene (\"Darvon\", \"Darvocet\") removed from the American market, because it can cause heart arrhythmias. In 2009, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel recommended that it be withdrawn from the market. The recommendation to ban the drug was ultimately not upheld and instead manufacturers were required to place additional warning labels on packaging. In 2009, Wolfe was appointed to the FDA's Drug Safety and Risk Management Committee. On November 19, 2010, the FDA recommended against continued prescribing and use of propoxyphene. Other drugs that Wolfe has campaigned against include Yaz, Yasmin, Phenacetin, Oraflex, Zomax, Vioxx, Baycol and many others. Wolfe has been interviewed on television by Phil Donahue, Barbara Walters, Bill Moyers, and Oprah Winfrey. He writes for the \"Huffington Post\".

Stz), sold under many brand names, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which was derived from dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It was developed by American pharmaceutical company Winthrop Laboratories (Sterling Drug) in 1962, and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use, though it is no longer marketed in the USA. It is also used in veterinary medicine. Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued, and remains available in only a few countries. It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals. Unlike most injectable AAS, stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension, or in oral tablet form. The drug has a high oral bioavailability, due to a C17α alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested. It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form. Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and many other sporting bodies. Additionally, stanozolol has been used in US horse racing. Stanazol has been used with some success in treated venous insufficiency. It stimulates blood fibrinolysis and has been evaluated for the treatment of the more advanced skin changes in venous disease such as lipodermatosclerosis. Several randomized trials noted improvement in the area of lipodermatosclerosis, reduced skin thickness, and possibly faster ulcer healing rates with stanozolol. Stanozolol is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. Side effects of stanozolol include virilization (masculinization), hepatotoxicity, and others. As an AAS, stanozolol is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and DHT. It is not a substrate for 5α-reductase as it is already 5α-reduced, and so is not potentiated in so-called \"androgenic\" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. This results in a greater ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity compared to testosterone. In addition, due to its 5α-reduced nature, stanozolol is non-aromatizable, and hence has no propensity for producing estrogenic effects such as gynecomastia or fluid retention. Stanozolol also does not possess any progestogenic activity of significance. Because of the presence of its 17α-methyl group, the metabolism of stanozolol is sterically hindered, resulting in it being orally active, although also hepatotoxic. Stanozolol has high oral bioavailability, due to the presence of its C17α alkyl group and the resistance to gastrointestinal and liver metabolism that it results in. The medication has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 5% of that of testosterone and 1% of that of DHT. Stanozolol is metabolized in the liver, ultimately becoming glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Its biological half-life is reported to be 9 hours when taken by mouth and 24 hours when given by intramuscular injection in the form of an aqueous suspension. It is said to have a duration of action of one week or more via intramuscular injection. Stanozolol, also known as 17α-methyl-2<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"H\"-androst-2-eno[3,2-\"c\"]pyrazol-17β-ol, is a synthetic 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a derivative of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with a methyl group at the C17α position and a pyrazole ring attached to the A ring of the steroid nucleus. Chemical syntheses of stanozolol have been published. Stanozolol is subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary metabolites are unique to stanozolol and are detectable in the urine for up to 10 days after a single 5–10 mg oral dose. Methods for detection in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In 1962, Stanozolol was brought to market in the US by Winthrop under the tradename \"Winstrol\" and in Europe by Winthrop's partner, Bayer, under the name \"Stromba\". Also in 1962, the Kefauver Harris Amendment was passed, amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness of their drugs before approval. The FDA implemented its Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program to study and regulate drugs, including stanozolol, that had been introduced prior to the amendment. The DESI program was intended to classify all pre-1962 drugs that were already on the market as effective, ineffective, or needing further study. The FDA enlisted the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate publications on relevant drugs under the DESI program. In June 1970 the FDA announced its conclusions on the effectiveness of certain AAS, including stanozolol, based on the NAS/NRC reports made under DESI. The drugs were classified as probably effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis but only as an adjunct, and in pituitary dwarfism (with a specific caveat for dwarfism, \"until growth hormone is more available\"), and as lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness for several other indications. Specifically, the FDA found a lack of efficacy for stanozolol as \"an adjunct to promote body tissue-building processes and to reverse tissue-depleting processes in such conditions as malignant diseases and chronic nonmalignant diseases; debility in elderly patients, and other emaciating diseases; gastrointestinal disorders resulting in alterations of normal metabolism; use during pre-operative and postoperative periods in undernourished patients and poor-risk surgical cases due to traumatism; use in infants, children, and adolescents who do not reach an adequate weight; supportive treatment to help restore or maintain a favorable metabolic balance, as in postsurgical, postinfectious, and convalescent patients; of value in pre- operative patients who have lost tissue from a disease process or who have associated symptoms, such as anorexia; retention and utilization of calcium; surgical applications; gastrointestinal disease, malnourished adults, and chronic illness; pediatric nutritional problems; prostatic carcinoma; and endocrine deficiencies.\" The FDA gave Sterling six months to stop marketing stanozolol for the indications for which there was no evidence for efficacy, and one year to submit further data for the two indications for which it found probable efficacy. In August and September 1970, Sterling submitted more data; the data was not sufficient but the FDA allowed the drug to be continued to be marketed, since there was an unmet need for drugs for osteoporosis and pituitary dwarfism, but Sterling was required to submit more data. In 1980 the FDA removed the dwarfism indication from the label for stanozolol since human growth hormone drugs had come on the market, and mandated that the label for stanozolol and other steroids say: \"As adjunctive therapy in senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis. AAS are without value as primary therapy but may be of value as adjunctive therapy. Equal or greater consideration should be given to diet, calcium balance, physiotherapy, and good general health promoting measures.\" and gave Sterling a timeline to submit further data for other indications it wanted for the drug. Sterling submitted data to the FDA intended to support the effectiveness of Winstrol for postmenopausal osteoporosis and aplastic anemia in December, 1980 and August 1983 respectively. The FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee considered the data submitted for osteoporosis in two meetings held 1981 and the data for aplastic anemia in 1983. In April 1984, the FDA announced that the data was not sufficient, and withdrew the marketing authority for stanozolol for senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis and for raising hemoglobin levels in aplastic anemia. In 1988, Sterling was acquired by Eastman Kodak for $5.1 billion and in 1994 Kodak sold the drug business of Sterling to Sanofi for $1.675 billion. Sanofi had stanzolol manufactured in the US by Searle, which stopped making the drug in October 2002. Even with no drug in production, Sanofi sold the stanozolol business to Ovation Pharmaceuticals in 2003, along with the two other drugs. At that time, the drug had not been discontinued and was considered a treatment for hereditary angioedema. In March 2009, Lundbeck purchased Ovation In 2010, Lundbeck withdrew stanozolol from the market in the US; as of 2014 no other company is marketing stanozolol as a pharmaceutical drug in the US but it can be obtained via a compounding pharmacy. Pfizer had marketed stanozolol as a veterinary drug; in 2013 Pfizer spun off its veterinary business to Zoetis and in 2014 Pfizer transferred the authorizations to market injectable and tablet forms of stanozolol as a veterinary drug to Zoetis. It is used in veterinary medicine as an adjunct in the management of wasting diseases, to stimulate the formation of red blood cells, arouse appetite, and promote weight gain, but the evidence for these uses is weak. It is used as a performance-enhancing drug in race horses. Its side effects include weight gain, water retention, and difficulty eliminating nitrogen-based waste products and it is toxic to the liver, especially in cats. Because it may promote the growth of tumors, it is contraindicated in dogs with enlarged prostates. Stanozolol and other AAS were commonly used to treat hereditary angioedema attacks, until several drugs were brought to market specifically for treatment of that disease, the first in 2009: Cinryze, Berinert, ecallantide (Kalbitor), icatibant (Firazyr) and Ruconest. Stanozolol is still used long-term to reduce the frequency of severity of attacks. \"Stanozolol\" is the generic name of stanozolol in English, German, French, and Japanese and its , , , , , and , while \"stanozololum\" is its name in Latin, \"stanozololo\" is its name in Italian and its , and \"estanozolol\" is its name in Spanish. \"Androstanazole\", \"androstanazol\", \"stanazol\", \"stanazolol\", and \"estanazolol\" are unofficial synonyms of stanozolol. It is also known by its former developmental code name \"WIN-14833\". Brand names under which stanozolol is or has been marketed include Anaysynth, Menabol, Neurabol Caps., Stanabolic (veterinary), Stanazol (veterinary), Stanol, Stanozolol, Stanztab, Stargate (veterinary), Stromba, Strombaject, Sungate (veterinary), Tevabolin, Winstrol, Winstrol Depot, and Winstrol-V (veterinary). The tradename Anabol should not be confused with Anabiol. In the United States, like other AAS, stanozolol is classified as a controlled substance under federal regulation; they were included as Schedule III controlled substances under the Anabolic Steroids Act, which was passed as part of the Crime Control Act of 1990. In New York, the state legislature classifies AAS under DEA Schedule III. Stanozolol and other synthetic steroids were first banned by the International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1974, after methods to detect them had been developed. There are many known cases of doping in sports with stanozolol by professional athletes. Stanozolol is especially widely used by the athletes from post-Soviet countries."], "neg": ["Gentech Pharmaceutical\nGentech Pharmaceutical Gentech Pharmaceutical is a company that develops and markets branded dietary supplements.

{"query": "Gold-leaf cone name origin instead of scientific classification", "pos": ["Correct name\nCorrect name In botany, the correct name according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the one and only botanical name that is to be used for a particular taxon, when that taxon has a particular circumscription, position and rank. Determining whether a name is correct is a complex procedure. The name must be validly published, a process which is defined in no less than 16 Articles of the ICN. It must also be \"legitimate\", which imposes some further requirements. If there are two or more legitimate names for the same taxon (with the same circumscription, position and rank), then the correct name is the one which has priority, i.e. it was published earliest, although names may be conserved if they have been very widely used. Validly published names other than the correct name are called synonyms. Since taxonomists may disagree as to the circumscription, position or rank of a taxon, there can be more than one correct name for a particular plant. These may also be called synonyms. The correct name has only one correct spelling, which will generally be the original spelling (although certain limited corrections are allowed). Other spellings are called orthographical variants. The zoological equivalent of \"correct name\" is \"valid name\". Different taxonomic placements may well lead to different correct names. For example, the earliest name for the fastest growing tree in the world is \"Adenanthera falcataria\" L.

The sole species, Pseudolarix amabilis, is commonly known as the golden larch, though it is not a true larch (\"Larix\"), being more closely related to \"Keteleeria\", \"Abies\" and \"Cedrus\". It is native to eastern China, occurring in small areas in the mountains of southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and eastern Sichuan, at altitudes of . Golden larch is sometimes known under an old scientific name \"Pseudolarix kaempferi\", but this may cause confusion with \"Larix kaempferi\", the Japanese larch. It is a deciduous coniferous tree reaching tall, with a broad conic crown. The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots and short shoots similar to a larch, though the short shoots are not so markedly short, lengthening about 5 mm annually. The leaves are bright green, 3–6 cm long and 2–3 mm broad, with two glaucous stomatal bands on the underside; they turn a brilliant golden yellow before falling in the autumn, hence the common name. The leaves are arranged spirally, widely spaced on long shoots, and in a dense whorl on the short shoots. The cones are distinctive, superficially resembling a small globe artichoke, 4–7 cm long and 4–6 cm broad, with pointed triangular scales; they mature about 7 months after pollination, when (like fir and cedar cones) they disintegrate to release the winged seeds. The male cones, as in \"Keteleeria\", are produced in umbels of several together in one bud. Golden larch is a very attractive ornamental tree for parks and large gardens, commonly referenced as the \"Koosh Ball tree.\" Unlike the true larches, it is very tolerant of summer heat and humidity, growing very successfully in the southeastern United States where most larches and firs do not succeed. In Europe growth is most successful in the Mediterranean region with notable specimens in northern Italy; further north in the United Kingdom it will grow, but only very slowly due to the cooler summers. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Golden Larch is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in Chinese herbology, where it is called \"jīn qián sōng\" (). \"Pseudolarix amabilis\" is used in traditional Chinese medicine as dermatologic antifungal remedy.", "Conifer cone\nConifer cone A cone (in formal botanical usage: strobilus, plural strobili) is an organ on plants in the division Pinophyta (conifers) that contains the reproductive structures. The familiar woody cone is the female cone, which produces seeds. The male cones, which produce pollen, are usually herbaceous and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The name \"cone\" derives from the fact that the shape in some species resembles a geometric cone. The individual plates of a cone are known as \"scales\". The male cone (microstrobilus or pollen cone) is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species to species. Extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls (modified leaves). Under each microsporophyll is one or several microsporangia (pollen sacs). The female cone (megastrobilus, seed cone, or ovulate cone) contains ovules which, when fertilized by pollen, become seeds. The female cone structure varies more markedly between the different conifer families, and is often crucial for the identification of many species of conifers. The members of the pine family (pines, spruces, firs, cedars, larches, etc.) have cones that are imbricate (that is, with scales overlapping each other like fish scales). These are the \"archetypal\" cones. The scales are spirally arranged in fibonacci number ratios. The female cone has two types of scale: the bract scales, derived from a modified leaf, and the seed scales (or ovuliferous scales), one subtended by each bract scale, derived from a highly modified branchlet. On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first, and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive gametophytes, then close during fertilization and maturation, and then re-open again at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6–8 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18–24 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and golden larch) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, cylindrical or ovoid (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2–60 cm long and 1–20 cm broad. After ripening, the opening of non-serotinous pine cones is associated with their moisture content—cones are open when dry and closed when wet. This assures that the small, wind disseminated seeds will be dispersed during relatively dry weather, and thus, the distance traveled from the parent tree will be enhanced. A pine cone will go through many cycles of opening and closing during its life span, even after seed dispersal is complete. This process occurs with older cones while attached to branches and even after the older cones have fallen to the forest floor. The condition of fallen pine cones is a crude indication of the forest floor's moisture content, which is an important indication of wildfire risk. Closed cones indicate damp conditions while open cones indicate the forest floor is dry. As a result of this, pine cones have often been used by people in temperate climates to predict dry and wet weather, usually hanging a harvested pine cone from some string outside to measure the humidity of the air. Members of the Araucariaceae (\"Araucaria\", \"Agathis\", \"Wollemia\") have the bract and seed scales fully fused, and have only one ovule on each scale. The cones are spherical or nearly so, and large to very large, 5–30 cm diameter, and mature in 18 months; at maturity, they disintegrate to release the seeds. In \"Agathis\", the seeds are winged and separate readily from the seed scale, but in the other two genera, the seed is wingless and fused to the scale. The cones of the Podocarpaceae are similar in function, though not in development, to those of the Taxaceae (q.v. below), being berry-like with the scales highly modified, evolved to attract birds into dispersing the seeds. In most of the genera, two to ten or more scales are fused together into a usually swollen, brightly coloured, soft, edible fleshy aril. Usually only one or two scales at the apex of the cone are fertile, each bearing a single wingless seed, but in \"Saxegothaea\" several scales may be fertile. The fleshy scale complex is 0.5–3 cm long, and the seeds 4–10 mm long. In some genera (e.g. \"Prumnopitys\"), the scales are minute and not fleshy, but the seed coat develops a fleshy layer instead, the cone having the appearance of one to three small plums on a central stem. The seeds have a hard coat evolved to resist digestion in the bird's stomach. Members of the cypress family (cypresses, arborvitae, junipers, redwoods, etc.) differ in that the bract and seed scales are fully fused, with the bract visible as no more than a small lump or spine on the scale. The botanical term galbulus (plural galbuli; from the Latin for a cypress cone) is sometimes used instead of strobilus for members of this family. The female cones have one to 20 ovules on each scale. They often have peltate scales, as opposed to the imbricate cones described above, though some have imbricate scales. The cones are usually small, long, and often spherical or nearly so, like those of Nootka cypress, while others, such as western redcedar and California incense-cedar, are narrow. The scales are arranged either spirally, or in decussate whorls of two (opposite pairs) or three, rarely four. The genera with spiral scale arrangement were often treated in a separate family (Taxodiaceae) in the past. In most of the genera, the cones are woody and the seeds have two narrow wings (one along each side of the seed), but in three genera (\"Platycladus, Microbiota\" and \"Juniperus\"), the seeds are wingless, and in \"Juniperus\", the cones are fleshy and berry-like. The cones and seeds of \"Sciadopitys\" (the only member of the family) are similar to those of some Cupressaceae, but larger, 6–11 cm long; the scales are imbricate and spirally arranged, and have 5-9 ovules on each scale. Members of the yew family and the closely related Cephalotaxaceae have the most highly modified cones of any conifer. There is only one scale in the female cone, with a single poisonous ovule. The scale develops into a soft, brightly coloured sweet, juicy, berry-like aril which partly encloses the deadly seed. The seed alone is poisonous. The whole 'berry' with the seed is eaten by birds, which digest the sugar-rich scale and pass the hard seed undamaged in their droppings, so dispersing the seed far from the parent plant. Though not included under the conifers, this group of cone-bearing plants retains some types of 'primitive' characteristics. Its leaves unfurl, much like ferns. There are three extant families of Cycads of about 305 species. It reproduces with large cones, and is related to the other conifers in that regard, but it does not have a woody trunk like most cone-bearing families. Like the Cycads, this unique cone-bearing plant is not considered a conifer, but belongs in the Order Welwitschiales. Welwitschia mirabilis is often called a living fossil and is the only species in its genus, which is the only genus in its family, which is the only family in its Order. The male cones are on male plants, and female cones on female plants. After emergence of the two cotyledons, it sets only two more leaves. Those two leaves then continue to grow longer from their base, much like fingernails. This allows it great drought tolerance, which is likely why it has survived in the desert of Namibia, while all other representatives from its order are now extinct. For most species found in Australia, male and female cones occur on the same plant (tree or shrub), with female usually on the higher branches towards the top of the plant. This distribution is thought to improve chances of cross-fertilization, as pollen is unlikely to be blown vertically upward within the crown of one plant, but can drift slowly upward in the wind, blowing from low on one plant to higher on another plant. In some conifers, male cones additionally often grow clustered in large numbers together, while female cones are more often produced singly or in only small clusters. A further characteristic arrangement of pines is that the male cones are located at the base of the branch, while the female at the tip (of the same or a different branchlet). However, in larches and cedars, both types of cones are always at the tips of short shoots, while both sexes of fir cones are always from side buds, never terminal. There's also some diversity in bearing in Cupressaceae. Some, \"Cupressus\" for instance, has little or no differentiation in the positions of male and female cones. Cone crop potential can be predicted in various ways. An early indication of a potential crop can be a period of abnormally hot, dry weather at the time of bud differentiation, particularly if the current and preceding cone crops have been poor (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Estimates of cone crop potential can be made by counting female reproductive buds in fall or winter, and an experienced observer can detect the subtle morphological differences and distinguish between reproductive buds and vegetative buds (Eis 1967b). White spruce seed collection is expensive, and collection from cone caches of red squirrels is probably the cheapest method. The viability of seed from cached cones does not vary during current caching, but viability drops essentially to zero after being in caches for 1 or 2 years (Wagg 1964). Collection of cones in seed orchards has been facilitated by the counter-intuitive technique of “topping” and collection of cones from the severed crown tops at one-third the cost of collection from untopped trees and without decreasing cone production (Slayton 1969, Nienstaedt 1981). Norway and Sitka spruce are prone to the formation of Pineapple gall pseudocones caused by the woolly aphid, \"Adelges abietis\". These are not cones, although they closely resemble them. Alder trees are not even conifers, however the mature seed bearing structures closely resemble cones. Because of their widespread occurrence, conifer cones have been a traditional part of the arts and crafts of cultures where conifers are common. Examples of their use includes seasonal wreaths and decorations, fire starters, bird feeders, toys, etc. An intriguing derivation of the impossible bottle mechanical puzzle takes advantage of the fact that pine cones open and close based on their level of dryness. In constructing \"the pine cone in the bottle\" display, a closed, damp cone of suitable size is inserted into a narrow-mouthed bottle and allowed to open upon drying. \"Cone cows\" are traditional homemade toys, made by children using material found in nature. The most common design is a spruce or pine cone with sticks or matches for legs, which can easily be attached by forcing them between the cone scales. Playing with cone cows often includes building an animal enclosure from sticks. For the most part, cone cows have been displaced by manufactured toys, at least in affluent countries, but the creation of cone cows still enjoys some popularity as an outdoor activity for children. Cone cows are a part of children's culture in Finland where they are known as \"Käpylehmä\" (plural: \"Käpylehmät\") and Sweden where they are known as \"kottkor\" or \"kottdjur\" (cone animals). Schools and other institutions teach children how to make cone cows as part of outdoors education on nature and history. In Finland there is a fairground with cone cow sculptures large enough for children to ride on. In Sweden, a video game was released in which the player may build virtual cone cows. Swedish artist Lasse Åberg has created artwork with cone cows, which has been included in an alphabet book and featured on a Swedish postage stamp among other classic toys. Cones are also occasionally used as a charge in heraldic coats of arms. Pinecones are symbolic for the Pineal Gland. Pinecones were also used as symbols of fertility in ancient Assyrian art. In Christian symbolism, they were closely symbolically related to the tree of life.", "Avanton Gold Cone\nAvanton Gold Cone The Avanton Gold Cone or Avanton Cone ( or ) is a late Bronze Age artefact, belonging to the group of Golden hats, only four of which are known so far.  The Avanton Cone was the second such object to be discovered (after the Golden Hat of Schifferstadt). It was found in 1844 in a field near the village of Avanton, about 12 km north of Poitiers, France. The object was damaged; comparison with other finds suggests that a part (the brim) is missing. The remaining part of the Avanton cone is 55 cm long and weighs 285 g.

{"query": "Rules and judging criteria of 16th century musical contests instead of contest outcomes", "pos": ["International classical guitar competitions\nInternational classical guitar competitions International classical guitar competitions are public events designed to identify and award outstanding classical guitar soloists, ensembles, and composers. They allow artists to promote themselves and gain exposure. Some competitions also have newly composed \"set\" pieces which serve to increase the classical guitar repertoire. The guitar seems to be the absentee in musical competitions until the Second World War.  In the recent years, much international classical guitar competitions were established.  Modern criticism of guitar competitions is actually quite common. Some criticisms are that they are often judged by unqualified judges, that reward people for being technically proficient without regard to musicality. But concerning the judging of musicality, this is in itself controversial, as the question arises, on how to judge art on any objective level.  Analysis of data at a piano competition, with many high-level participants, has made it doubtful that judges are able to make fully objective judgments; because there was a small correlation between the order of appearance of participants and their ranking: On the other hand, if a competition has many professional-level artistic participants, it may not even be possible to make an objective judgement of who is \"best\"; because: given numerous professional-level artistic performers, there may not even be room for the concept of comparison; since this presumes the existence of a \"best\" interpretation, which is itself questionable (and would be a commercialization of art; viewing it from a mass-consumption or absolutist point of view).", "Juried (competition)\nJuried (competition) A juried competition is a competition in which participants' work is judged by a person or panel of persons convened specifically to judge the participants' efforts, either by the competition's stated rubric or by a subjective set of criteria dependent upon the nature of the competition or the judges themselves. For example, in a juried competition where participants compete against each other for a monetary prize, for inclusion in a show or publication, or for representation by a gallery, the work presented is judged by one or more persons, often experts, for such prize, inclusion, or representation. The phrase 'juried competition' is usually used to describe creative contests: artistic and literary competitions rather than sports tournaments or academic and scholarship competitions, although such competitions have similarities. Generally, juried competitions are contests that individuals actively enter to compete for prizes, rather than events in which the competitors are passively nominated by others, such as the Academy Awards or the Turner Prize. The Guggenheim Fellowship is an example of an award which straddles the line between a scholarship contest and a juried art competition. The phrase 'juried competition' is also applied to non-fine-arts contests which yet encompass distinctively creative endeavors: a cook-off is one such contest. Juried competitions also include contests in film and television, as well as new media. Britain's Got Talent and American Idol are both juried competitions, as is the Disposable Film Festival. In very early juried competitions in Greece, under Aeschylus and his successors, theatrical contests \"advanced to a high degree of importance\" and were \"placed under the superintendence of\" (juried by) \"the magistracy\". The Greek god Agôn personifies solemn contests. During the Middle Ages in 1441, a public poetry competition called the Certame Coronario was held in Florence with the intention of proving that the spoken Italian language was not inferior to Latin. More recently, but before the advent of the Internet, national and international juried competitions were (and still are) advertised in trade publications, with jurists selected from among the artistic or literary elite. Before digitized images became widely available, competitions of visual works accepted primarily photographic slides from competitors to represent the work entered because of the cost-prohibitive nature of sending and receiving whole artworks. After judging, only the selected works were sent on for public viewing if the competition included such a venue for the selected works. Written works such as poetry and prose, being less bulky, were entered in competitions via post and received in their original format. Since the advent of the Internet, many competitions for visual works began accepting entries in digital form as well as slide form, while literary competitions began to accept works submitted online as well as by post. The growth of the Internet also saw service firms appear offering organizational tools for juried competitions allowing for such conveniences as online storage and access of digital images. Juried competitions also benefit from the immediacy of the Internet in that competitions listings are aggregated by some sites making such listings more widely accessible than when they were enumerated primarily in trade publications. Some juried competitions in art and literature exist entirely online, or both online and in print."], "neg": ["Freestyle to Music\nFreestyle to Music Freestyle to Music, sometimes known as Musical Kur or simply kur (from German \"kür\", \"freestyle\") is a form of dressage competition where the horses paces are set to music to create a competitive \"dance\". Movements and figures are choreographed to meet the technical requirements of the particular level with carefully chosen music that highlights the horse/rider combination. Musical Freestyles are entertaining and offer great audience appeal. International level competition comprises Prix St. Georges for Young Riders, Intermediate I and Grand Prix through the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI). As well as the international levels, Young Rider (Prix St. George), Intermediate I and Grand Prix, most National Federations (i.e. USDF, British Dressage have their own freestyle levels which usually correspond to their various levels of training.  Each level has its own list of mandatory movements and paces that must appear in all programs, however their order and timing is free to the rider's discretion, albeit within certain margins. Additionally, movements of the same or lower level which are not listed as compulsory may be included to demonstrate the skills and harmony of horse and rider. Incorporating movements of a higher level than the intended level is forbidden, with penalties varying from elimination in lower levels to specific deductions and limits in FEI events. For example, an Intermediare I rider is not permitted to include passage, piaffe, or a pirouette greater than 360 degrees, and a Grand Prix rider may not do a pirouette that exceeds 720 degrees or advanced airs above the ground. If a rider does so, he or she receives a zero for the element, and in addition the score for Choreography and Degree of Difficulty will not receive a score higher than a 5. Musical Freestyles are a component of the dressage competition at the Olympics, and the World Equestrian Games, where the Grand Prix Freestyle is used. The scoring of the freestyle is divided up into two major sections, known as Technical Execution, and Artistic Presentation. The technical section is made up of scores for each of the compulsory movements. The technical requirements of each level mirror the level of training and balance expected in the compulsory tests at that level. Competence and ease in the execution of the movements is crucial to a successful program. While the Technical Execution is divided so as to make up half the final score (50%), the technical components of rhythm, energy and elasticity and harmony between horse and rider are scored on the artistic portion score sheet as replacement for the collective marks on a set test, additionally, poor technical execution can negatively affect the degree of difficulty, Choreography and Music scores, thus the technical execution make up nominally 70% of the final score, and can affect all of the marks. The Artistic score is usually divided into 5 sections each with a coefficient of four at International competitions, They are: The Rhythm, Energy and Elasticity mark comprises the first two collective marks from a set test, that being Paces and Impulsion, while the Harmony between Horse & Rider mark is made up of the second two: Submission and Rider. The remaining scores are somewhat connected to the technical execution, but are for the most part dependent on the artistic qualities of the test. The choreography must incorporate all the technical requirements for the level but is otherwise open to creative choices and highlighting the horse's strong points. Good marks are awarded to inventive choreography which contains movements not taken directly out of the set tests, but has an element of surprise and adventure to their placement. However, there should still be a logical order and flow to the movements, such as symmetry and without too many changes between the paces. A chaotic freestyle would score worse than a basic one. The music chosen will depend on the horse's movement, type, personality, and the rider's own musical tastes but should serve to accentuate all of them. Music for freestyles can be found in a variety of styles; Classical music, show tunes, movie scores, orchestral versions of pop and contemporary music are common choices. Generally, it is preferred that the music for all three gaits should be of the same genre. The interpretation of the music means that it should enhance the horse's way of going and match the tempos of his gaits. The music should suggest the movements; transitions should correspond to the transitions in the music. It is imperative that the choreography interpret the music. Movements and figures should be started and finished at obvious musical phrases. The level of difficulty should correspond to the horse's abilities so that the ride looks easy. A horse which is more advanced horse for any given level will be able to perform more complex movement combinations, or more extreme movements (e.g. 720° pirouette, 2:3 Half-Pass etc.) which are rewarded as being more difficult. However, this comes at the increased risk of loss of rhythm or a mistake in sequence, which would result in more marks lost that would have been gained. A good freestyle program is entertaining to the audience and pleasing to perform."]}

Her name \"Zhiruo\" is derived from her birthplace, Zhijiang. Her mother died when she was very young. When she was 10, her father was killed by Yuan soldiers but she was saved by Zhang Sanfeng. She meets the young Zhang Wuji, who was travelling with Zhang Sanfeng, and they develop a friendship. Zhang Wuji leaves them later and follows Chang Yuchun to Butterfly Valley to seek treatment from Hu Qingniu. Zhang Sanfeng brings Zhou Zhiruo back to Wudang and recommends her to join the Emei Sect. She becomes an apprentice of Abbess Miejue, the leader of Emei. Zhou Zhiruo meets Zhang Wuji several years later and falls in love with him. However, Miejue dislikes Zhang Wuji because of his affiliation with the \"evil\" Ming Cult. She forces Zhou Zhiruo to swear that she must not marry Zhang Wuji or have any romantic feelings for him. The oath is as follows: Miejue names Zhou Zhiruo the new leader of Emei and tells her the secret behind the Heaven Reliant Sword and the Dragon Slaying Saber. She tells Zhou Zhiruo to extract the martial arts manuals and the \"Book of Wumu\" concealed in the weapons' blades and master those skills, and use them to glorify Emei. Zhou Zhiruo is unwilling to harm Zhang Wuji, but is bound by her oath to do so. On Divine Serpent Island, she steals the weapons and breaks them by clashing them together, obtaining the secret items hidden inside. She apparently murders Yin Li and frames Zhao Min for the deed. Zhou Zhiruo practises the skills detailed in the \"Nine Yin Manual\", mastering a quick-learning, unorthodox and \"evil\" version of the skill, known as the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw', as well as the 'Heart Shattering Palm' and 'White Boa Whip Skill'. As the story progresses, she develops a closer relationship with Zhang Wuji, until she decides to break her oath and marry him. However, Zhao Min shows up and disrupts the wedding. Zhou Zhiruo attacks Zhao Min in anger but Zhang Wuji intervenes and stops her. Zhou Zhiruo feels that Zhang Wuji has betrayed her love, and begins to see him and Zhao Min as her sworn enemies. She pretends to marry Song Qingshu of the Wudang Sect, who has a crush on her, and passes him the Nine Yin Manual, telling him to learn 'Nine Yin Skeleton Claw′ and use it to defeat Zhang Wuji. During the Lion Slaying Ceremony held at Shaolin Monastery, Zhou Zhiruo defeats all martial artists who attended and emerges as champion of the \"wulin\" (martial artists' community).

The Xuaming Elders attempt to steal the manual from Zhou Zhiruo after seeing how her martial arts have improved from learning it. They injure her with their 'Xuanming Divine Palm', but Zhang Wuji saves her and heals her with his 'Nine Yang Divine Skill', which inadvertently negates her \"Yin\" inner energy and restores her back to her original state. Zhou Zhiruo feels guilty for her sins, especially when she encounters the \"ghost\" of Yin Li and admits to Zhang Wuji her past deeds and her love towards him. Towards the end of the story, Zhang Wuji tells her that he has decided that Zhao Min is his true love, making her give up on him.

{"query": "November Revolution causes and global consequences outside of Hesse politics", "pos": ["World revolution\nWorld revolution World revolution is the Marxist concept of overthrowing capitalism in all countries through the conscious revolutionary action of the organized working class. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allowed a revolutionary party to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a workers' state based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools, such as Trotskyism, the essentially international character of the class struggle and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of socialism in one country. The end goal of such internationally oriented revolutionary socialism is to achieve world socialism, and later, stateless communism. The October Revolution of 1917 in Russia sparked a revolutionary wave of socialist and communist uprisings across Europe, most notably the German Revolution, the Hungarian Revolution, Biennio Rosso and the revolutionary war in Finland with the short lived Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic, which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also Revolutions of 1917-23. Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that capitalism would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the Comintern, founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the Russian Civil War into an essentially Soviet-sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide. With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see \"Socialism in one country\". After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again. As fascism grew in Europe in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the Comintern opted for a Popular Front with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of World War II in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's Western allies. A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the aftermath of World War II, though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as Greece, France, and Italy had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of anti-fascist resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in Eastern Europe, meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, Western media criticized the lack of liberal democratic elements in their rise to power. Nonetheless, Communist movements in Eastern Europe proliferated, even with some local cases independent of the USSR, such as the Yugoslav Partisans, who also were integral in repelling fascism during World War II. Revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the establishment of the New Left together with the Civil Rights Movement, the militancy of the Black Panther Party and similar armed/insurrectionary \"Liberation Front\" groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the labor movement for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, \"The East is Red, and the West is Ready\". However, this radical left spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain right-wing, economically conservative ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by Thatcherism in the United Kingdom and Reaganomics in the United States) and also free-market reforms in China and in Vietnam. Within Marxist theory, Lenin's concept of the labor aristocracy and his description of imperialism, andseparately, but not necessarily unrelatedlyTrotsky's theories regarding the deformed workers' state, offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of proletarian internationalism."], "neg": ["November 1916 (novel)\nNovember 1916 (novel) November 1916 is a novel by famed Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

The novel picks up on the brink of the Russian Revolution, depicting characters from all walks of life — from soldiers and peasants to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and Lenin. Unlike the first novel, the book does not revolve around any specific historical events. Instead, the book portrays everyday lives and politics as they were in the period between Imperial Russia's peak and the February Revolution. The novel's original Russian title is Oktyabr 1916 — October 1916; during the period in which the novel is set, Russia had not yet adopted the Gregorian calendar, and so its dates were somewhat out of step with the rest of the world. (And the February Revolution, mentioned above, occurred in late February 1917 according to the calendar then in use, but early March according to the Gregorian calendar.) In \"November 1916\", the novel literary form is used as a device to link together what are best described as a series of essays and polemics. Solzhenitsyn uses long and detailed conversations (typically dialogues) between the characters in this novel as a way of presenting political and philosophical arguments. Several of the fictional characters, especially those engaged in the dialogs, are very thinly disguised historical personages. The dialogue device brings out many of the issues which were important topics of dissention in pre-revolutionary Russia. Although Solzhenitysn himself is openly contemptuous of the leftist/liberal tendency in Russian political thought and public life in this period, he gives these views full airing along with other views more in sympathy with his own, especially in his long dialogues."]}

About north-east of New Guinea, it is located mid-ocean at 7 degrees North latitude, and is part of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia. The atoll consists of a protective reef, around, enclosing a natural harbour , with an area of . It has a land area of , with a population of 36,158 people and a maximal height of 443 m. Weno city on Moen Island functions as the atoll's capital and also as the state capital and is the largest city in the FSM with its 13,700 people. Chuuk means \"mountain\" in the Chuukese language. The lagoon was known mainly as Truk (a mispronunciation of Ruk), until 1990. Other names included Ruk, Hogoleu, Torres, Ugulat, and Lugulus. Chuuk Lagoon is part of the larger Caroline Islands group. The area consists of eleven major islands (corresponding to the eleven municipalities of Truk lagoon, which are Tol, Udot, Fala-Beguets, Romanum, and Eot of Faichuk group, and Weno, Fefan, Dublon, Uman, Param, and Tsis of Namoneas group) and forty-six smaller ones within the lagoon, plus forty-one on the fringing coral reef, and is known today as the Chuuk islands, part of the Federated States of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean. This is the following list of islands, villages and population following the 2010 census: It is not known when the islands of Chuuk were first settled, but archaeological evidence indicates that islands of Feefen and Wééné Islands had human settlements in the first and second century BC. Later evidence indicates that widespread human settlements appeared in Chuuk during the 14th century AD. The first recorded sighting by Europeans was made by Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra on board of the ship \"Florida\" during August or September 1528. They were later visited by Spaniard Alonso de Arellano on 15 January 1565 on board of galleon patache \"San Lucas\". As part of the Caroline Islands, Truk was claimed by the Spanish Empire, which made an effort to control the islands in the late 19th century. Chuuk lagoon was then inhabited by several tribes that engaged in intermittent warfare, as well as a small population of foreign traders and missionaries. Spanish control over the islands was nominal. The Spaniards stopped to raise a flag over Chuuk in 1886, and returned in 1895 as part of an attempt to assert control and negotiate peace between warring Chuukese tribes. No permanent Spanish settlement was ever established, and tribal violence continued until the German colonial era.  The Caroline Islands were sold to the German Empire in 1899, after Spain withdrew from the Pacific in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.  Chuuk then became a possession of the Empire of Japan under a mandate from the League of Nations following Germany's defeat in World War I. During World War II, Truk Lagoon was the Empire of Japan's main base in the South Pacific theatre. Truk was a heavily fortified base for Japanese operations against Allied forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, serving as the forward anchorage for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Truk Lagoon was considered the most formidable of all Japanese strongholds in the Pacific. On the various islands, the Japanese Civil Engineering Department and Naval Construction Department had built roads, trenches, bunkers and caves. Five airstrips, seaplane bases, a torpedo boat station, submarine repair shops, a communications center and a radar station were constructed during the war. Protecting these various facilities were coastal defense guns and mortar emplacements. The Japanese garrison consisted of 27,856 IJN men, under the command of Vice Admiral Masami Kobayashi, then Vice Admiral Chuichi Hara, and 16,737 IJA men, under the command of Major General Kanenobu Ishuin. Due to its heavy fortifications, both natural and manmade, the base at Truk was known to Allied forces as \"the Gibraltar of the Pacific.\" A significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based at Truk, with its administrative center on Tonoas (south of Weno). At anchor in the lagoon could be found the IJN's battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, tankers, cargo ships, tugboats, gunboats, minesweepers, landing craft, and submarines. In particular, \"Yamato\" and \"Musashi\", the largest battleships ever built, were stationed at Truk for months around 1943, unable to participate in battle due to lack of air cover. Some have described Truk as Japan's equivalent of the Americans' Pearl Harbor, in that it was their respective nation's largest forward naval base. In 1944, Truk's capacity as a naval base was destroyed through naval air attack. Forewarned by intelligence a week before the US raid, the Japanese had withdrawn their larger warships (heavy cruisers and aircraft carriers) to Palau. Once the American forces captured the Marshall Islands, they used them as a base from which to launch an early morning attack on February 17, 1944 against Truk Lagoon. Operation Hailstone lasted for three days, as American carrier-based planes sank twelve smaller Japanese warships (light cruisers, destroyers, and auxiliaries) and thirty-two merchant ships, while destroying 275 aircraft, mainly on the ground. The consequences of the attack made \"Truk lagoon the biggest graveyard of ships in the world.\" The attacks for the most part ended Truk as a major threat to Allied operations in the central Pacific. The Japanese garrison on Eniwetok was denied any realistic hope of reinforcement and support during the invasion that began on February 18, 1944, greatly assisting U.S. forces in their conquest of that island. Truk was isolated by Allied (primarily U.S.) forces, as they continued their advance towards Japan, by invading other Pacific islands, such as Guam, Saipan, Palau and Iwo Jima. It was attacked again from 12 to 16 June 1945 by part of the British Pacific Fleet during Operation Inmate. Cut off, the Japanese forces on Truk and other central Pacific islands ran low on food and faced starvation before Japan surrendered in August 1945. In 1969, William A. Brown and French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and his team explored Truk Lagoon. Following Cousteau's 1971 television documentary about the lagoon and its ghostly remains, the place became a scuba diving paradise, drawing wreck diving enthusiasts from around the world to see its numerous, virtually intact sunken ships. The shipwrecks and remains are sometimes referred to as the \"Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon\". Scattered mainly around the Dublon, Eten, Fefan and Uman islands within the Truk group, a number of the shipwrecks lie in crystal clear waters less than below the surface. In waters devoid of normal ocean currents, divers can easily swim across decks littered with gas masks and depth charges and below deck can be found evidence of human remains. In the massive ships' holds are the remnants of fighter aircraft, tanks, bulldozers, railroad cars, motorcycles, torpedoes, mines, bombs, boxes of munitions, radios, plus thousands of other weapons, spare parts, and other artifacts. Of special interest is the wreck of the submarine \"I-169 Shinohara\" which was lost when diving to avoid the bombing. The submarine had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. On 13 November 1973, Kimiuo Aisek, a native Chuukese from Tonoas (Dublon), opened the first dive operation in Micronesia, Blue Lagoon Dive Shop. As a 17-year-old he had witnessed the American \"Operation Hailstone\" attack Feb. 17–18, 1944. Prior to the attack he had worked with the Japanese as a stevedore and spoke fluent Japanese. Aisek's biography, \"Witness To War: Truk Lagoon's Master Diver Kimiuo Aisek\" was published by Dianne M. Strong on the 40th anniversary of the dive shop, 13 November 2013. Aisek had purchased the former Truk Continental Hotel in 1998 from Continental Airlines. Aisek had revered the wrecks as grave sites and was an early proponent of conservation and the Truk Lagoon National Monument, founded by the Truk District Legislature in 1972. Known as a wreck finder and dive guide, Aisek hosted many celebrities, including William A. Brown and his three sons in 1988, underwater photographers Al Giddings and Chuck Nicklin, oceanographer-conservationist Dr. Sylvia Earle, John Kennedy Jr., Special Olympics founder Timothy Shriver, NASA's 3-time Hubble astronaut Kathy Sullivan, \"Titanic\"'s James Cameron, 1980 Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly, TV and film star Bill Paxton, and Australia's \"Crocodile Hunter\" Steve Irwin. Aisek died at age 73 on 4 January 2001. In 2009 Aisek was the first to be inducted posthumously into the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame in Grand Cayman. On 13 September 2014 Aisek's son, Gradvin, dedicated the 2400-square foot Kimiuo Aisek Memorial Museum. Located next to the Truk Blue Lagoon Resort and Dive Shop, it is the first museum in Chuuk State. It contains Micronesia's greatest collection of nautical artifacts, and includes a Chuukese ethnographic exhibit. The coral encrusted wrecks attract a diverse array of marine life, including manta rays, turtles, sharks and corals. In 2007, 266 species of reef fish were recorded by an Earthwatch team and in 2006 the rare coral \"Acropora pichoni\" was identified. On 12 April 2011, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program Foreign Correspondent screened a report on Chuuk Lagoon likening the effect of the impending massive release of tens of thousands of tonnes of oil from the rusting Japanese warships into the coral reef to that of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. However, given the poor state of the Japanese war effort in 1944, many of the ships may have had relatively small amounts of fuel in their bunkers. Environmental protection organizations are surveying the wrecks while also consulting with Japanese researchers to try to determine how much oil is likely to be in the hulks, particularly in three sunken oil tankers. The ships are classified as a Japanese war grave, requiring Japanese government involvement in the eventual clean-up. Most of the roads and transportation systems are poor or in disrepair; an extensive infrastructural redevelopment plan has begun. It consists of a five-phase project to completely reconstruct the existing sewer, water and storm drainage systems as well as pour 10\" concrete roadways in the majority of the villages of Weno. Final contractual bidding was complete in late 2008 and construction began in June 2009. Completion of Phase 1, which extends from the Chuuk International Airport through downtown into Mwan Village and encompassing the roadways to the financial center, hospital, governmental center and projected site of the College of Micronesia is slated for completion by 2012. Surveying for Phase 2, which extends from Mwan Village to Wiichap is underway. The cost for a taxi ranges between a dollar ($1) to two dollars ($2) depending on the distance traveled. Presently, a drive from the airport to the Blue Lagoon resort and dive shop could take up to 35 minutes to complete, although the distance is less than 5 miles. Chuuk International Airport (IATA airport code TKK) is on the administrative island of Moen. It is served by United Airlines, formerly Continental Micronesia, locally known as Air Mike. The government of the state operates a radio station. Interisland communication is often accomplished using citizens' band radio. Telephone services are limited on Chuuk, though a cellular network is established within some islands of the lagoon and in the near future on the outer islands. High speed Internet access via ADSL has been made available on a monthly subscription basis on the Island of Moen from May 2010. Tourism, especially scuba diving among the many wrecks of Truk Lagoon, is the island's main industry with live-aboard dives amongst the most popular ways to see the hundreds of wrecks located in the shallow waters of the lagoon. Copra, dried coconut meat, is the only cash crop and output is relatively insignificant. Most of the inhabitants of outlying islands engage in subsistence activity only."], "neg": ["Herald Shoal\nHerald Shoal Herald Shoal is a region of high benthic productivity on the Chukchi Sea shelf. It serves as rich foraging habitat for many species of marine mammals and birds.  Herald Shoal is approximately 50 meters deep in most places. The shoal diverts warm water flowing northward from the Bering Sea and holds colder water long into the summer season, which allows sea ice to persist in this area longer. Herald Shoal is no longer covered by continuous pack ice, but along with Hanna Shoal, has some of the most reliable ice present on the entire Chukchi shelf. Herald Shoal has relatively colder, saltier, and more nutrient rich water compared to more easterly water, and during the spring ice retreat this region experiences high primary productivity from phytoplankton blooms. This leads to the region’s rich seafloor, making it a significant food resource for many marine species. In early to mid-summer, Herald Shoal has a high-concentration of walrus that are either migrating through the region or foraging for food. Beluga whales have been observed concentrating around the Shoal in the fall before they migrate southward into the Bering Sea. Like Hanna Shoal, Herald Shoal is likely to be important as ocean conditions change. Identified as an important area by scientists, Herald shoal will likely provide ecosystem resilience to climate change due to the unique characteristics of the region that makes it so productive."]}

The word host is an archaic word for army. The Cossack host consisted of a certain territory with Cossack settlements that had to provide military regiments for service in the Imperial Russian Army and for border patrol. Usually the hosts were named after the regions of their dislocation. The \"stanitsa\", or village, formed the primary unit of this organization. In the Russian Empire, the Cossacks constituted eleven separate hosts, settled along the frontiers: the Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, Ural, Orenburg, Siberian, Semiryeche, Transbaikal, Amur, and Ussuri.  There was also a small number of the Cossacks in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, who would form the Yenisey Cossack Host and Irkutsk Cossack Regiment of the Ministry of the Interior in 1917.

Early in his career at HUL, he did two stints as an Area Sales Manager, and worked in Brooke Bond and several skincare brands. One of his biggest achievements in HUL was \"Project Bharat\", a successful rural-reach strategy that incentivized people in rural areas to try HUL's products. In 2006, he was roped in by Sunil Mittal (founder and Group CEO of Bharti Enterprises) to join Bharti Airtel as the head of marketing. His first stint at Airtel lasted only two years, till 2008. During this period, he redefined the relationship between operations and marketing in the organization, and changed Bharti's marketing strategy to cater to the mass market. His other major achievements during this period included segmenting customers to develop targeted offerings, and bundling mobile handsets with Airtel offers. In 2008, Vittal was persuaded to return to HUL by its CEO, Nitin Paranjpe. He was reappointed head of the home and personal care (HPC) businesses and given a board seat, superseding several company executives. In the period before Vittal, HPC businesses were growing at only 5-6 percent per annum at HUL. Vittal turned around the businesses, and between 2008 and 2012, the segment grew at a compounded annual rate of 14.7 per cent. Vittal, who was seen in HUL as second only to Paranjpe, left the company again in early 2012, a few months before the latter received a five-year extension as CEO. In early 2012, Vittal re-joined Bharti Airtel, as a Director in charge of special projects and international business strategy. He spent most of 2012 and early 2013 at SingTel. In early 2013, Airtel announced that Vittal would be the next CEO of Airtel India.

A member of the Republican Party, she previously served in the South Dakota House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011. Noem successfully ran for the 2018 gubernatorial election and is the Governor-elect of South Dakota. Upon her accession to the governorship, she will be the first woman to hold the office. Kristi Arnold was born to Ron and Corrine Arnold in Watertown, South Dakota and raised with her siblings on the family ranch and farm in rural Hamlin County. She graduated from Hamlin High School in 1990, and won the South Dakota Snow Queen title. She credited the experience with helping her polish her public speaking and promotional skills. After high school, she enrolled at Northern State University. She married Byron Noem at age 20. At age 22, Noem left college to help run her family's ranch after her father was killed in a farm machinery accident. Noem said that upon her father's death, she and her family members decided to take out a loan to pay taxes owing on the estate, noting that \"for 10 years that loan really impacted our ability to make a profit\". Over the years, Noem added a hunting lodge and restaurant to the property, and all of her siblings have moved back to assist in expanding the businesses. After her father's accident, Noem stopped attending college full-time but, over the years, took classes at the Watertown campus of Mount Marty College, and South Dakota State University. After being elected to Congress, she continued her education, taking online courses and receiving credits for her work as a representative – leading the \"Washington Post\" to dub her Capitol Hill's \"Most Powerful Intern.\" She earned a B.A. from the Department of Political Science at South Dakota State University in December 2011. Noem entered political life by serving on local committees and boards. In 2006, she won a seat in the South Dakota House of Representatives representing the 6th District (comprising parts of Beadle, Clark, Codington, Hamlin, and Kingsbury counties, but not including the city of Watertown). In 2006, she won with 39% of the vote. In 2008, she won re-election to a second term, with a plurality of 41% of the vote. Noem served for four years, from 2007 to 2010, and was an Assistant Majority Leader during her last year. According to the \"Daily Caller\", Noem was noted for being a tough and knowledgeable state legislator. She publicly accused a state senator of a conflict of interest during a legislative hearing thus killing his effort to stop the construction of an Indian casino. In 2009 and 2010 she sponsored bills to lower the age of compulsory education in South Dakota to 16, after it had been raised to 18 in 2008, arguing that requiring school attendance until age 18 has not been proven to improve graduation rates. Supporters of the higher age argue that it increases graduation rates and provides motivation for students who would otherwise drop out.  On June 8, 2010, Noem ran for South Dakota's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She won the Republican primary with a plurality of 42% of the vote against South Dakota Secretary of State Chris Nelson and State Representative Blake Curd. According to Sabato's Crystal Ball blog, Noem's \"victory over two A-list opponents\" was impressive. Her primary opponents endorsed her in the general election. Noem's opponent, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, emphasized her own record of independence from the Democratic caucus including her no votes on health care reform, the Wall Street bailouts, and the cap-and-trade energy bill. In response, Noem repeatedly highlighted Herseth Sandlin's vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. A \"Washington Post\" story on the race described Noem as \"a made-for-Fox News star\" and described her as a \"mama grizzly\" in the mold of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. During the 2010 election cycle, Noem out-raised Herseth Sandlin $2.3 million to $2.1 million. Of those totals, Noem received 84 percent of her cash from individual contributors while Herseth Sandlin received 56% from political action committees. Mitt Romney's PAC made a donation to Noem's campaign, and Romney endorsed her. Gallup polls in June 2010 showed Republican candidates ahead of their Democratic counterparts due to dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama. Polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports consistently gave a Noem a slight edge over Herseth Sandlin following the June GOP primary, with Noem pulling ahead 47 percent to 44 percent in early October. Critics said the Rasmussen firm's surveying methods were erratic and tended to favor Republican candidates. Noem defeated Herseth Sandlin 48%–46%.  Noem won re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Matthew Varilek 57%–43%.  Noem won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Corinna Robinson 67%–33%.  Noem won re-election to a fourth term, defeating Democrat Paula Hawks 64%–36%. Noem is the fourth woman to represent South Dakota in the U.S. Congress. Noem and fellow freshman U.S. Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, were elected by acclamation of the 2011 House Republican 87-member freshman class to be liaisons to the House Republican leadership—making Noem the second woman member of House GOP leadership. According to \"The Hill\" Noem's role was to push the leadership to make significant cuts to federal government spending and to help Speaker John Boehner manage the expectations of the freshman class. In March 2011, Republican U.S. Representative Pete Sessions from Texas named Noem one of the twelve regional directors for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2012 election campaign. Noem has promoted legislation to combat human trafficking and sexual slavery. Noem is a co-sponsor of H.R.4058 in the 113th Congress Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act and other U.S. House resolutions designed to end human trafficking. Noem fulfilled a campaign promise by voting in January 2011 to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Though the repeal was not signed into law, she has stated that she will work with the House members to defund the health care reform, while retaining measures she supports such as the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the provision allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plan into their 20s and the high-risk pools. New provisions that Noem wants to add to federal law include limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and allowing patients to buy health insurance plans from other states. She supports cuts to Medicaid funding proposed by Republican Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan that would reduce benefits for South Dakota Medicaid recipients by 55 percent. Noem calls the budget deficit one of the most important issues facing Congress, and is a cosponsor of H.J.Res. 2, which would require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts. She cites the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, high-speed rail projects, cap-and-trade technical assistance, and subsidies for the Washington Metro rapid transit system as examples of a federal programs where she would like to see spending cuts. She indicated that she would vote to raise the federal spending limit. She wants to eliminate the estate tax, lower the corporate tax rate, and simplify the tax code to make it less cumbersome. She has also stated that she would not raise taxes to balance the budget. Noem opposes abortion. She has the support of Susan B. Anthony List. She stated after her election that she hopes to maintain a 100 percent pro-life voting record.  Noem has stated that the U.S. must end its dependence on foreign oil. To achieve that goal, Noem says Congress should encourage conservation of existing resources. She supports continuing ethanol subsidies that benefit her state. Noem opposes ending federal subsidies for oil companies. Noem supports the Keystone XL Pipeline and has promised to continue to work for its construction even though the U.S. Senate voted down legislation to advance the pipeline through the U.S. Congress. Noem helped the House pass the legislation on November 14, 2014. Noem opposes a bill introduced by South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson that would designate over of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland as protected wilderness. Noem supports the current designation of the land as a national grassland. She points out that the land is already managed as roadless areas similar to wilderness. Noem argues that raising the land's designation from protected grassland to wilderness will further limit leaseholders access to the land and further imperil grazing rights. She supports off-shore oil drilling. She co-sponsored three bills that she argues will reduce American dependence on foreign oil by ending the 2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and re-opening sales on oil leases in the Gulf and off the coast of Virginia. In 2011, Noem sponsored a measure to block Environmental Protection Agency funding for tighter air pollution standards for coarse particulates. Noem supported the American military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war, but questioned whether America intervened to protect civilians, or whether the U.S. military would try to remove Libya's leader, Muammar Gaddafi. In March 2011, Noem called on the President to provide more information about America's role in the conflict, characterizing his statements as vague and ambiguous. Since her election, Noem has raised 56 percent of donations from individuals and 44 percent from political action committees. On March 8, 2011, Noem announced the formation of a leadership political action committee called KRISTI PAC. Noem said she will use the PAC to pay expenses and support other Republican candidates. Former South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Steve Kirby is the treasurer of the PAC. Noem was among the top freshman Republicans in PAC fundraising in the first quarter of 2011, raising $169,000 from PACs and hosting at least 10 Washington fundraisers. She has said she has no plans to join the House Tea Party Caucus. In August 2013, conservative \"Newsmax\" magazine named Noem among the \"25 most influential women in the GOP\".  On November 14, 2016, she announced that she would not seek re-election to Congress but instead run for Governor of South Dakota in 2018. She defeated incumbent South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley in the June 5th primary, winning by a margin of 56% to 44%. Noem defeated Democratic challenger, Billie Sutton in the general election. Noem supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order that suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and banned all travel to the U.S. by nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. Noem said that she supported a temporary ban on accepting refugees from \"terrorist-held\" areas, but \"did not address whether she supports other aspects of the order, which led to the detention of legal U.S. residents such as green-card holders and people with dual citizenship as they reentered the country\" in the aftermath of the order's issuance. In 2017, Noem was part of the conference committee for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. She worked closely with Ivanka Trump to preserve the Child Care Credit and was influential in finalizing the home mortgage interest deduction, the Adoption tax Credit, continuing credit for charitable contributions, and retaining popular retirement savings options. Noem was a steady advocate for fully repealing the estate tax. While the final bill did not include a full repeal, it doubled exemption levels and maintained the stepped-up basis, which she says provides some relief for South Dakota farmers and ranchers. In 2018, Kristi Noem, a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, was reported to have \"pitched the idea to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus\" to attach her online sales tax bill to the government funding package at the time, as part of an omnibus. A court case under consideration in the South Dakota Supreme Court involved requiring \"certain out-of-state retailers to collect its sales taxes.\" Noem considers that South Dakota businesses (and by extension businesses nationwide) \"could be forced to comply with 1,000 different tax structures nationwide without the tools necessary to do so\", adding that her legislation \"provides a necessary fix.\" Noem lives with her husband and their three children on the Racota Valley Ranch near Castlewood. As of 2009, she had a 16.9 percent ownership stake in the ranch. Her recreational interests include hunting. From 1989 to 2010, Noem received 27 traffic citations, including 20 for speeding and other violations. Noem said, \"I'm not proud of my driving record, but [I've] been working hard to be a better example to young kids and young drivers out there.\" She had paid her fines and penalties by August 2010."], "neg": ["Ruth Peetoom\nRuth Peetoom Gerhardine Ruth Peetoom (born 25 July 1967) is a Dutch politician of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).

Mattern moved to New York City as a young adult in 1971 with ambitions of becoming a fashion designer, briefly attending Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and working as a hairdresser for a while. Mattern soon became fascinated with NYC nightlife especially the work of DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage. After adopting the pseudonym \"Junior Vasquez\", he began his career in music production in the 1980s. Vasquez worked with DJ and pop remixer/producer Shep Pettibone, and together they co-produced and edited numerous singles from artists like Madonna, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, MC Hammer, Prince, Pet Shop Boys and others. Vasquez landed a brief residency at Club Bassline, where he began to make a name for himself as a live DJ. Many of Junior Vasquez's earliest underground hits were released under the name \"Ellis D\", including the gay house track, \"Work This Pussy\". Vasquez also released the tracks \"Just Like a Queen\", \"My Lolleata\", \"It's Scratched\", and \"Took My Love Away\". From 1989 to 1995, Vasquez was the DJ at the original Sound Factory, a club he co-founded with Richard Grant, which was located at 530 W. 27th St in the Chelsea district. Major record labels began soliciting Vasquez to produce club-friendly remixes for their top singers using his personal beat-driven house style. Due to a rise in demand from these labels, many singer and musicians like C+C Music Factory, David Morales, Björk, Marilyn Manson, and Madonna were known to frequent his Sunday morning events. Working with many popular artists allowed Vasquez to create his own repertoire of exclusive \"Private Collection\" of authorized remixes (along with several unofficial remixes) which were not released to the market and thus made his live sets even more distinctive to his following due to the fact that they could only be heard at Vasquez's Sound Factory events. Junior Vasquez also was closely associated at this time with The House of Xtravaganza, a gay ballroom \"house\" which enjoyed a great prominence in New York City at this time. In the early 1990s, Vasquez released his single \"X\", which sampled Danny Xtravaganza say the word \"extravaganza!\" (the voice sample was taken from Danny Xtravaganza's 1990 single \"Love the Life You Live\"). After the Sound Factory was closed in February 1995, Vasquez held residencies at the Tunnel (1995-1996), and at ArenA (held at the Palladium) (1996–1997) where his suspended booth was custom designed by designers Dolce & Gabbana. In 1997, he returned to the former site of the original Sound Factory, now called Twilo. Remodeled to include a custom-designed DJ booth for Vasquez's exclusive use and fitted with new cutting-edge audio technology known as \"Phazon\", Vasquez's residency at Twilo lasted until May 2001 when the venue was closed by order of the city. In 1997, Ian Jenkinson and Inner Rhythm Artists Tribal Gathering enlisted Vasquez for the largest single artist DJ even in UK history at the London Arena. Problems with the venue saw the event split between the two clubs: Ministry of Sound and Cream. Vasquez held shorter-lived residencies at the various clubs in New York, including Discothèque, Sound Factory (so-named by Richard Grant who retained legal rights to the name) and opened in a new space located in Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. In addition to his work as a DJ and remixer, he has co-produced albums for John Mellencamp, For Real, Lisa Lisa, and Cyndi Lauper as well as individual LP tracks for Madonna, Cher, Wild Orchid, and Kristine W. Vasquez, along with his record label Junior Vasquez Music, is also known for introducing new artists, including many crossover singers, to dance/pop music scene, including Vernessa Mitchell, Jason Walker, Casey Stratton, Quentin Elias, Vivian Green, and Sam Harris. Vasquez had a public falling out with Madonna in 1996, after the release of an unauthorized single titled \"If Madonna Calls\". The original version that Vasquez plays at nightclubs contains what is widely believed to be an actual phone message from Madonna left on Vasquez's answering machine. The song's lyrics are as follows: (voice recording ostensibly left by Madonna on Vasquez's answering machine at his home in New York): \"Hello, Junior. This is Madonna. Are you there? (short pause) Call me in Miami.\" This is followed by the voice of vocal house artist, author of song Franklin Fuentes, which says:\"If Madonna calls, I'm not here.\" This is followed by hard tribal rhythms, with the samples of the message still playing in the loop of the track, and the male singer repeating the words shown above along with \"Hola, Señorita Cosa\" (\"Hello, Ms. Thing\"). Toward the end of the song, the words change, and the male voice concludes by saying: \"If Madonna calls…actually, if she calls, just disconnect her. That's right—if she calls, tell her I'm not here.\" Note: The industry standard by which a remix is considered commercially released is the track has been made available legally for retail sale. This can mean the remix was released on a CD single, 12\" vinyl single, cassette single, or it can mean the remix was released on one of the artist's albums (usually on a greatest hits compilation or as a bonus track to a studio album's international release). Other times it was included on a compilation or soundtrack album. The tracks listed below have all been released commercially in one of the aforementioned forms, with a few exceptions which are indicated with a note in parenthesis explaining the track's status. With the advent of Internet-selling using programs such as iTunes, that type of release is also considered commercial as it results in a profit and the artist and management oversee what is available on such programs."]}

Their home uniform is white with powder blue and gold trim, and features the team nickname. It was used from 1948–58. The original MPLS uniforms were later used as throwback uniforms in the 2001–02 and 2017–18 seasons. In their final years in Minneapolis, the uniforms were tweaked, eliminating gold and replaced the city abbreviation with the team nickname on their road uniforms; the uniform featured four stars surrounding the front of the jersey. The shade of blue used in the home uniforms was changed to royal blue. The powder blue version was used during the 2004–05 season as throwback uniforms. Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1960, they retained the blue and white scheme. The uniforms now feature a cursive 'Los Angeles' lettering. The road uniforms were royal blue with white and powder blue trim, while the home uniforms were white with royal and powder blue trim. The shorts feature the wordmark 'Lakers' on either side of the leg. The uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 1996–97 and 2003–04 seasons. In 1967, Jack Kent Cooke purchased the Lakers and moved to The Forum. Cooke made some drastic changes to the Lakers' look by outfitting them in purple (known as Forum blue until the early 1980s) and gold uniforms.  The initial purple and gold look featured a slanted \"Lakers\" script and white numbers with either gold or purple drop shadows. With a few changes in the striping scheme, this look would be used by the Lakers until the 1977–78 season.  The 1971–72 version of the gold uniforms were used as throwback uniforms in the 2010–11 season. However, this uniform featured sans-serif player names and a straight \"Lakers\" script, whereas the originals had serifed player names and a slanted \"Lakers\" script. The gold uniforms were overhauled prior to the 1978–79 season, switching from white numbers to purple numbers with white drop shadows. The new look was unveiled a year before Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers and Magic Johnson launched the Showtime era. During the early 1980s, the Lakers wore mismatched shades of purple in their uniforms. On most occasions, the jersey was rendered in a darker shade whereas the shorts were lighter in hue and vice versa. This color issue was corrected later in the decade, during this time the \"Lakers\" script gradually realigned to a straight arrangement. The Lakers revived the \"Showtime\" gold uniforms as throwbacks during the 2007–08 and 2016–17 seasons. In a home game against the Boston Celtics on December 30, 2007, the Lakers wore short shorts to match their throwback uniforms in the first half before switching to the baggy-styled shorts in the second half. Prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers unveiled a new uniform set. The side stripes now extend towards the jersey, the drop shadows were removed, a modernized \"Lakers\" script was introduced, and white numbers returned to the gold uniform.  At the time of its unveiling, Nike served as the Lakers' uniform provider along with several other teams. The enduring feature of this uniform was the \"wishbone\" collar, which was also adopted by the Dallas Mavericks, Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat and Toronto Raptors upon releasing their respective uniforms. In the 2002–03 season, the Lakers unveiled a white alternate uniform. The white jerseys were designed by Lakers owner Jerry Buss' daughter Jeanie Buss, in tribute to Chick Hearn, who was regarded as the voice of the team for forty years until his death in August 2002.  Along with the unveiling of the white alternate uniform, the Lakers released a new alternate logo featuring the purple \"L\" outside a gold basketball. This logo was then placed on the purple and gold uniforms prior to the 2004–05 season. These jerseys are only played on Sunday games. From the 2013–14 to the 2016–17 seasons, the Lakers wore a black uniform that was inspired from the Hollywood night life. Dubbed 'Hollywood Nights', the uniform was black with purple and gold trim. They debuted the uniform on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on November 27, 2013, and were used for select Friday home dates. A variation of the 'Hollywood Nights' jerseys, featuring sleeves, was unveiled for the 2014–15 season. From the 2007–08 to the 2016–17 seasons, the Lakers wore special edition white uniforms for NBA's Noche Latina events. The uniforms were similar to the Sunday whites, but with the wordmark \"Los Lakers\". During the 2013–14 season, the Lakers wore a sleeved version of the Noche Latina uniforms, with \"Los Lakers\" in gold with purple trim, and greyscale patterns at the back. The Lakers wore special Christmas-themed uniforms as part of the NBA's Christmas games from 2012 to 2016. They wore the following one-off Christmas uniforms:  For the 2017–18 season, Nike took over the league's uniform contracts and the NBA did away with the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designation. The Lakers white jersey became the team's \"Association\" jersey (named as such because every NBA team has a white jersey), the gold became the \"Icon\" jersey, and the purple became the \"Statement\" jersey that each team has. In addition, Nike has a \"City\" uniform that pays tribute to each team's local culture and heritage. The Lakers' \"City\" uniforms are known as the \"Lore Series\" designed to honor its greatest players. In the 2017–18 season, their \"City\" uniform paid tribute to Kobe Bryant. The following season, the Lakers unveiled a new \"Lore Series\" uniform focusing on Magic Johnson. Just before the 2018–19 season, the Lakers updated their uniforms. The side stripes were removed from the gold \"Icon\" and white \"Association\" uniform (the shorts retain this feature), while black side stripes with gold and white trim flank the purple \"Statement\" uniform.  In addition, drop shadows return to the uniform numbers for the first time since 1999. And in another first for the franchise, the Lakers will feature gold numbers with white drop shadows on the purple uniform, while the gold uniforms will return to purple numbers with white drop shadows. Even though the Lakers have traditionally worn purple on the road, gold at home and more recently white on Sunday home games, there have been a few instances where the Lakers eschewed tradition. During the 2007–08 season, the Lakers wore their classic gold uniforms for two away games: December 22 against the Philadelphia 76ers, and December 23 against the New York Knicks. The home team wore their white throwback uniforms. Similarly, they wore their 1971–72 gold uniforms for three away games: February 10, 2011 against the Celtics, February 11 against the Knicks, and February 13 against the Orlando Magic. With the exception of the Magic, the Lakers' opponents wore throwback uniforms for the occasion. In recent years, the Lakers occasionally broke out their gold uniforms for a few away contests against teams that wore their dark primary, alternate or throwback uniforms. But after Nike became the league's outfitter for 2017 and beyond, the Lakers were forced to use only their gold \"Icon\" and white \"Association\" uniforms on either home or away games for the first two months of the season, after which the purple \"Statement\" uniforms were added to the rotation.  In another break from tradition, the Lakers wore their purple \"Statement\" uniforms for the first time in a home game on November 29, 2017 against the Golden State Warriors.", "1987–88 Los Angeles Lakers season\n1987–88 Los Angeles Lakers season The 1987–88 season saw the Lakers win their eleventh NBA championship, defeating the Detroit Pistons in a hard-fought seven games in the NBA Finals to become the NBA’s first repeat champions since the Boston Celtics did it in the 1968–69 NBA season. In doing so, the Lakers made good on Pat Riley's famous promise to repeat as champions. “I'm guaranteeing everybody here,” Riley said at the civic celebrations following the Lakers’ 1987 championship win, “next year we’re gonna win it again.” Before the Lakers could make good on Riley's guarantee, they swept the San Antonio Spurs in the opening round of the playoffs. The following two rounds however would not be as easy for the Lakers, but they still managed to get through a tough seven-game series against both the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Semis and the Dallas Mavericks Western Conference Finals. By the time the Lakers had finished their season they had played an NBA record 106 games including another record 24 playoff games, winning 77 and losing 29. The Lakers went 62–20 in the regular season and 15–9 in the playoffs. The 1988 Finals was the last time the Showtime-era Lakers won an NBA championship. It was also the final time that the franchise won a championship at The Forum. They did not win another league title until 2000, when they were playing at the Staples Center. Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were all selected to play in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game held in Chicago. Pat Riley was chosen to coach the Western Conference All-Stars.

The team was owned by Bert Lina, owner of the Federal Express franchise in the Philippines. The team moniker was taken as a reference for the province's proximity to Laguna de Baý, a similar action taken by the then-Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball Association. The team played its home games at the San Luis Sports Complex. In 1998, the Metropolitan Basketball Association was formed as a regional-based professional league which also challenged the commercial Philippine Basketball Association. The Lakers of coach Bonnie Garcia were paraded by former University of Manila stars Biboy Simon and Jovy Sese, Manuel Luis Quezon University standout Wynne Arboleda and the former Letran Knights high-flying Mike Garcia, known for wearing different shoe colors and his dunks. The Lakers went 14–8 in the inaugural year but failed to enter the Northern Conference Finals. Simon recorded an MBA record 54 points in one game, which remained until the league's closure. In 1999, the Lakers went 16–14 in the elimination round and made the playoffs for the second straight year. The team added fil-Americans Cris Clay and Rudy Hatfield to bolster their lineup. However, Laguna was eliminated by the Pampanga Dragons, in a hard-fought three-game Wildcard series which saw Dragons point guard Roel Bravo hitting a three-pointer to give Pampanga the win. In 2000, Laguna made its only MBA finals appearance in the Crossover Conference tournament, losing to the San Juan Knights in the finals. The Lakers made it to the National Playoffs, only to be eliminated by the same Knights team, 2–0. Jeff Flowers joined the team to power the Lakers frontline. Laguna was renamed as the FedEx-Laguna Lakers for the 2001 season but lost to San Juan in the playoffs for the third-straight time. The Laguna Lakers competed at the William Jones Cup as the Philippine representative in 2000 and 2001. In the 2001 edition, the Fed-Ex Laguna Lakers, with some players from the Philippine national youth team, finished fourth after losing to Russian basketball team, Lokomotiv Novosibirsk in the de facto third place play-off with the final score of 71-81. In 2001, the PBA's Tanduay Rhum Masters sold its PBA franchise to the Lina group for a reported 60–75 million pesos. The development led to the Lina group's departure from the MBA to concentrate on their new PBA franchise, which became named as the FedEx Express. The MBA, as a result, lost its Laguna franchise and one of its biggest sponsors, FedEx, before closing shop at the middle of the 2002 season."]}
{"query": "University of Chicago academic programs instead of Elayne Rapping's personal life there", "pos": ["College of the University of Chicago\nCollege of the University of Chicago The College of the University of Chicago is the university's sole undergraduate institution and one of its oldest components, emerging contemporaneously with the university's Hyde Park campus in 1892. Instruction is provided by faculty from across all graduate divisions and schools for its 6,300 students, but the College retains a select group of young, proprietary scholars who teach its core curriculum offerings. Unlike many major American research universities, the College is small in comparison to the University's graduate divisions, with graduate students outnumbering undergraduates at a 2:1 ratio. The College is most notable for its core curriculum pioneered by Robert Maynard Hutchins, which remains among the most expansive of highly ranked American colleges, as well as its emphasis on preparing students for continued graduate study since 85% of graduates go onto graduate study within 5 years of graduation, which is higher than any other school, and around 15-20% of graduates go on to receive PhDs. For 2016, 2017, and 2018, \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked the University of Chicago as 3rd in the nation for undergraduate education, behind Princeton and Harvard, and tied with Yale. In 2012, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked the University of Chicago's undergraduate program 4th in the country, ahead of every Ivy League institution except Princeton; it was also ranked 1st in the Midwest, 3rd among research universities, and 4th among private colleges. In 2010, \"Forbes\" also named the University of Chicago a \"billionaire university,\" ranking the university as the 6th most successful in the country for producing billionaire alumni. In 2007 \"Princeton Review\" named the College as having the \"Best Undergraduate Academic Experience\" in the United States. In the 2012 edition of \"The Best 376 Colleges\", the Princeton Review ranked UChicago 7th for politically active students, 9th for students who study the most, 13th for the best college library, and named it a \"best-value college\"; the Princeton Review moreover finds that in general applicants to UChicago also simultaneously apply to Ivy League institutions and their associates. In 2012, \"Newsweek\" ranked UChicago 5th for having happy students, 9th for academic rigor, and 12th for being stressful. In 2012, the \"QS World University Rankings\" ranked the University of Chicago as the 4th best institution of higher learning in the United States, after MIT, Harvard, and Yale, as well as 8th in the entire world. In addition, \"College Crunch\", an online college admissions resource, ranked the University of Chicago as 1st in the country among colleges and universities for its undergraduate college. The University also has the highest SAT ranges for admitted students of any school in the nation. For the class of 2015, the middle 50% range for combined math and reading SAT scores was 1420-1530. Up until the 2007-2008 admissions cycle the school exclusively used a self-dubbed \"Uncommon Application\", and did not accept the more popular, nationalized Common Application, which can be sent to multiple institutions, for collegiate admissions. However, in 2009, the school adopted the Common Application and included a supplement that kept the spirit of the Uncommon Application. The cornerstone of the previously used Uncommon Application and the current supplement is a unique set of essay questions that have attracted a lot of attention for the school. Prompts have ranged from the bizarre, \"Write an essay somehow inspired by super-huge mustard,\" to intentionally vague prompts such as \"Find X\" to esoteric quotes by famous individuals such as \"mind that does not stick\" - Zen Master Shoitsu (in this prompt, only the quote was provided; no question was asked). In the 2011-2012 season, there was a question that referenced a game in which students use Wikipedia to draw connections between seemingly unrelated things: \"What does Play-Doh have to do with Plato?\" The school's acceptance rate fell to a record low of 7.2% for the class of 2022. In comparison, the acceptance rate was 8.7% for the class of 2021. The yield also hit a record-high 72% for the class of 2021, ranking as the fourth-highest in the country, behind only Harvard, Stanford and MIT. In June 2018, as part of its new Empower initiative, the University announced that it would become the first major American research university to adopt a test-optional policy for undergraduate applicants, along with guaranteeing free tuition to students whose families made under $125000 per year and expanding scholarships to veterans, as well as the children of police officers and firefighters. The college offers 52 majors (originally called 'concentrations,' but changed in 2004). A primary departmental or committee affiliation is denoted for those whose names differ from that of their field designation. A student is awarded either the A.B. or S.B. degree. The college notably does not offer majors in pre-professional areas such as engineering (with the exception of the newly introduced Molecular Engineering program) or finance; however, the school contends that students going on to graduate study in these fields often can select work in related areas such as physics or economics in order to receive adequate preparation within the liberal arts tradition. The college recently introduced minors in a select numbers of fields, and also offers several joint bachelors / masters programs to high performing students in a variety of subjects. The University of Chicago requires all undergraduates to fulfill the Common Core, which demands work across all areas of the liberal arts for both A.B. and B.S. concentrators, albeit in a form reduced from the Hutchins era. Currently, 15 courses are required in addition to tested foreign language proficiency (one year of \"de novo\" study being expected as preparation) if no Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate examinations are used for exemption (a reduction of six credits, or two full-time quarters, may be achieved via this method). While the science curriculum has largely followed the intellectual evolution of its respective fields, the requisite humanities and social science sequences now have several variants that encompass non-Western, non-canonical, and critical theory texts. This is a departure from the school's traditional ties to texts of the European tradition such as Plato and Locke. While in totality the core curriculum's goal is to impart an education that is both timeless and a vehicle for interdisciplinary debate, the increasing number of options to students within its confines produces a wide variety of backgrounds amongst graduates. The College often publishes literature that emphasizes the \"life of the mind,\" drawing attention to the school's serious academic environment. Alternatively, a popular phrase with students is \"where fun comes to die,\" describing the school's lack of a stereotypical college party culture. Efforts in the 1990s, under President Hugo F. Sonnenschein to change some of these perceptions of the College were controversial, though ultimately successful. Although Greek life is not predominant among the undergraduate population, there are several active fraternities and sororities that have established histories with the College, including Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Upsilon, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Phi Gamma Delta, Zeta Psi, Psi Upsilon and Sigma Chi fraternities, as well as alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi sororities. The campus is also home to three coeducational professional Greek organizations, which are Alpha Phi Omega, a community service fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity, and Phi Alpha Delta, a pre-law fraternity, in addition to the Epsilon Club, a local social fraternity that was formerly the University of Chicago chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon.  The annual University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt is a multi-day event in which large teams compete to obtain all of the notoriously esoteric items on a list. Held every May since 1987, it is considered to be the largest scavenger hunt in the world. Established by student Chris Straus, \"Scav\" (as it is known among University students) has become one of the university's most popular traditions and has typically pushed the boundaries of absurdity. Each year, the list includes roughly 300 items, each with an assigned point value; the items vary widely, and often include performances, large-scale construction, technological construction, competition, and travel, as well as the traditional \"find this item\" listings. Most teams fall well short of completing half of the list and instead compete for total points amassed. The more difficult and time-consuming items earn more points, and teams typically devote more resources into these items. Notable extracurricular groups include the University of Chicago College Bowl Team, which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national championships, leading both categories internationally. The Chicago Debate Society has had a top four team at the American Parliamentary Debate Association's National Championship tournament four out of the past five years. The University's competitive Model United Nations team was the top ranked team in North America in 2013-14, 2014-15, and Fall 2015. The Model UN community also hosts two major conferences per year: MUNUC (Model United Nations at the University of Chicago), held in February for high school students, and ChoMUN (Chicago Model United Nations), held in April for college students. Another notable organization is the Chicago Society, established in 2001. Chicago Society invites world-renowned speakers on a variety of issues and topics to campus. Recent invitees have included Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Steven Levitt, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, and Anwar Ibrahim. Their events have appeared in newspapers around the world. The university's independent student newspaper is the \"Chicago Maroon\". Founded in 1892, the same year as the university, the newspaper is published every Tuesday and Friday. \"South Side Weekly\" is a student-run alternative weekly covering issues and arts on the South Side of Chicago. Undergraduates publish a number of periodicals as well, including \"Sliced Bread\", an annual arts and literature publication and the University's largest magazine, \"The Chicago Shady Dealer\", a humor magazine, \"Vita Excolatur\", an erotic magazine, and \"Euphony\", a literary journal. The University of Chicago's University Theater is one of the oldest student-run theatre organizations in the country, involving as many as 500 members of the university community, producing 30 to 35 shows a year, and selling on the order of 10,000 tickets. It also operates Off-Off Campus, one of the University's two improv comedy troupes, started in 1986 by Bernard Sahlins, one of the founders of The Second City. WHPK, a student-run and University-owned radio station, broadcasts out of the Reynolds Club on the university campus. DJ \"JP Chill\" has had a rap and hip hop show on WHPK since 1986. It was one of the earliest rap shows in the country and the first in Chicago. The administration has controversially worked to combat the university's reputation as a place \"where fun comes to die\", which some claim have discouraged top students from taking the university into serious consideration when researching colleges. The university also hosts Doc Films, the country's oldest student-run film society. The school's NCAA Division III teams, most of which are members of the University Athletic Association, are not a major focus on campus today, appearing almost \"minimal\" in their role on campus to \"non-existent\" according to students. However, in the first half of the twentieth century, the school was a powerhouse in Big Ten Conference play, notably in football where the school won numerous national championships, and produced the very first Heisman Trophy winner, Jay Berwanger. President Robert Maynard Hutchins suspended sports for several years though during his tenure fearing their digressive nature from academic endeavors, ending the prominence of most athletic programs. Today the many programs aim to cultivate the \"student-athlete,\" the emphasis being on balance between the two. Varsity sports offered are baseball, football and wrestling for men, softball and volleyball for women, and basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming, tennis and track and field for both men and women. The college employs a house system whereby undergraduates living in dormitories are assigned to a block of students of usually no more than 70 which serves as a focal point for university events. Most campus dormitories contain multiple houses, though Stony Island has only one, the eponymous Stony Island House. Each building is overseen by a resident master, and should there be more than one house, each a resident head. One or two upper division undergraduates are then selected to serve in addition as resident assistants for each house. All first years are required to live in housing, however, the availability of affordable, off campus apartments makes them a popular option with a sizable segment of the student body. Moreover, students are free to bid or request switches amid houses both between academic years and during them.

She received her bachelor's degree in education and history from Framingham State College in 1970 and also a master's degree in education, supervision and administration from Bowie State University in 1978. She took a teaching position as a social studies teacher at Concord High School in New Hampshire in 1983. In 1985, she was selected from more than 11,000 applicants to participate in the NASA Teacher in Space Project and was scheduled to become the first teacher in space. As a member of mission STS-51-L, she was planning to conduct experiments and teach two lessons from Space Shuttle \"Challenger\". On January 28, 1986, the shuttle broke apart 73 seconds after launch. After her death, schools and scholarships were named in her honor, and in 2004 she was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. Sharon Christa Corrigan was born on September 2, 1948, in Boston, Massachusetts. She was the eldest of the five children of accountant Edward Christopher Corrigan (1922–1990) of Irish descent and Grace Mary Corrigan ( 1924-2018 ) (née George), a substitute teacher, whose father was of Lebanese Maronite descent. McAuliffe was a great niece of Lebanese-American historian Philip Khuri Hitti. She was known by her middle name from an early age, although in later years she signed her name \"S. Christa Corrigan\", and eventually \"S. Christa McAuliffe\". The year she was born, her father was completing his sophomore year at Boston College. Not long thereafter, he took a job as an assistant comptroller in a Boston department store, and they moved to Framingham, Massachusetts, where she attended and graduated from Marian High School in 1966. As a youth, she was inspired by Project Mercury and the Apollo moon landing program. The day after John Glenn orbited the Earth in \"Friendship 7\", she told a friend at Marian High, \"Do you realize that someday people will be going to the Moon? Maybe even taking a bus, and I want to do that!\" She wrote years later on her NASA application form: \"I watched the Space Age being born, and I would like to participate.\" In 1970, she married her longtime boyfriend whom she had known since high school, Steven J. McAuliffe, a 1970 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, and they moved closer to Washington, D.C., so that he could attend the Georgetown University Law Center. They had two children, Scott and Caroline, who were nine and six, respectively, when she died. She obtained her first teaching position in 1970, as an American history teacher at Benjamin Foulois Junior High School in Morningside, Maryland. From 1971 to 1978, she taught history and civics at Thomas Johnson Middle School in Lanham, Maryland. In addition to teaching, she completed a Master of Arts in education supervision and administration from Bowie State University in Maryland. In 1978, she moved to Concord, New Hampshire, when Steven accepted a job as an assistant to the New Hampshire Attorney General. McAuliffe taught 7th and 8th grade American history and English in Concord, New Hampshire, and 9th grade English in Bow, New Hampshire, before taking a teaching post at Concord High School in 1983. She was a social studies teacher, and taught several courses including American history, law, and economics, in addition to a self-designed course: \"The American Woman\". Taking field trips and bringing in speakers were an important part of her teaching techniques. According to \"The New York Times\", she \"emphasized the impact of ordinary people on history, saying they were as important to the historical record as kings, politicians or generals.\" In 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced the Teacher in Space Project, and Christa learned about NASA's efforts to find their first civilian, an educator, to fly into space. NASA wanted to find an \"ordinary person,\" a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit. McAuliffe became one of more than 11,000 applicants. NASA hoped that sending a teacher into space would increase public interest in the Space Shuttle program, and also demonstrate the reliability of space flight at a time when the agency was under continuous pressure to find financial support. President Reagan said it would also remind Americans of the important role that teachers and education serve in their country. The Council of Chief State School Officers, a non-profit organization of public officials in education, was chosen by NASA to coordinate the selection process. Out of the initial applicant pool, 114 semi-finalists were nominated by state, territorial, and agency review panels. McAuliffe was one of two teachers nominated by the state of New Hampshire. The semi-finalists gathered in Washington, DC, from June 22–27, 1985, for a conference on space education and to meet with the Review Panel that would select the 10 finalists. On July 1, 1985, she was announced as one of the 10 finalists, and on July 7 she traveled to Johnson Space Center for a week of thorough medical examinations and briefings about space flight. The finalists were interviewed by an evaluation committee composed of senior NASA officials, and the committee made recommendations to NASA Administrator James M. Beggs for the primary and backup candidates for the Teacher in Space Project. On July 19, 1985, Vice President George H. W. Bush announced that she had been selected for the position. Another teacher, Barbara Morgan, served as her backup. According to Mark Travis of the \"Concord Monitor\", it was her manner that set her apart from the other candidates. NASA official Alan Ladwig said \"she had an infectious enthusiasm\", and NASA psychiatrist Terrence McGuire told \"New Woman\" magazine that \"she was the most broad-based, best-balanced person of the 10.\" Later that year, she and Morgan each took a year-long leave of absence from teaching in order to train for a space shuttle mission in early 1986. (NASA paid both their salaries.) While not a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, McAuliffe was to be part of the STS-51-L crew, and would conduct experiments and teach lessons from space. Her planned duties included basic science experiments in the fields of chromatography, hydroponics, magnetism, and Newton's laws. She was also planning to conduct two 15-minute classes from space, including a tour of the spacecraft, called \"The Ultimate Field Trip\", and a lesson about the benefits of space travel, called \"Where We've Been, Where We're Going, Why.\" The lessons were to be broadcast to millions of schoolchildren via closed-circuit TV. To record her thoughts, McAuliffe intended to keep a personal journal like a \"woman on the Conestoga wagons pioneering the West.\" After being chosen to be the first teacher in space, she was a guest on several television programs, including \"Good Morning America\"; the \"CBS Morning News\"; the \"Today Show\"; and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", where, when asked about the mission, she stated, \"If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. Just get on.\" She had an immediate rapport with the media, and the Teacher in Space Project received popular attention as a result. On January 28, 1986, McAuliffe boarded \"Challenger\" with the other six crew members of STS-51-L. Just 73 seconds into its flight at an altitude of 48,000 feet, the shuttle broke apart, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members. According to NASA, it was in part because of the excitement over her presence on the shuttle that the accident had such a significant effect on the nation. Many schoolchildren were viewing the launch live, and media coverage of the accident was extensive. The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" Accident—also known as the Rogers Commission—was formed to investigate the disaster. It determined that the accident was due to a failure of rubber O-rings made by Morton-Thiokol that provided a pressure seal in the aft field joint of the shuttle's right Solid Rocket Booster. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a design flaw, as their performance could be too easily compromised by factors that included the low temperature on the day of launch. The Commission found that O-ring resiliency is directly related to temperature and due to the low temperature at launch—36 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees lower than the next coldest previous launch—it was probable the O-rings had not provided a proper seal. Barbara Radding Morgan, her backup, became a professional astronaut in January 1998, and flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-118, to the International Space Station, on August 8, 2007, aboard \"Endeavour\", the orbiter that replaced \"Challenger\". McAuliffe was buried at Blossom Hill Cemetery in her hometown, Concord. She has since been honored at many events, including the Daytona 500 NASCAR race in 1986. The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord and the Christa Corrigan McAuliffe Center for Education and Teaching Excellence at Framingham State University are named in her memory, as are the asteroid 3352 McAuliffe, the crater McAuliffe on the Moon, and a crater on the planet Venus, which was named McAuliffe by the Soviet Union. Approximately 40 schools around the world have been named after her, including the Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Scholarships and other events have also been established in her memory. The Christa McAuliffe Technology Conference has been held in Nashua, New Hampshire, every year since 1986, and is devoted to the use of technology in all aspects of education. The Nebraska McAuliffe Prize honors a Nebraska teacher each year for courage and excellence in education. Grants in her name, honoring innovative teachers, are provided by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and the National Council for the Social Studies. In 1990, she was portrayed by Karen Allen in the TV movie \"Challenger\". The spaceship on the 1996–1997 children's science-fiction series \"Space Cases\", about a group of students lost in space, was called \"Christa\". In 2006, a documentary film about her and Morgan called \"Christa McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars\" aired on CNN in the \"CNN Presents\" format. The film, produced by Renee Sotile and Mary Jo Godges, commemorated the 20th anniversary of her death. It was narrated by Susan Sarandon, and included an original song by Carly Simon. Her parents worked with Framingham State College to establish the McAuliffe Center. Her husband Steven J. McAuliffe remarried and in 1992 became a federal judge, serving with the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire in Concord. Her son, Scott, completed graduate studies in marine biology, and her daughter, Caroline, went on to pursue the same career as her mother: teaching. On July 23, 2004, she and all the other 13 astronauts lost in both the \"Challenger\" and \"Columbia\" disasters were posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush. On January 28, 2016, Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" was honored once again, but in a uniquely memorable way. Dozens of teachers who competed alongside the fallen Christa McAuliffe traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, to remember those lost on that day 30 years ago. Christa McAuliffe's son Scott and her widower, Steven, also participated in the ceremony. After remarking on the fact that 30 years had indeed passed, Steven said \"Challenger will always be an event that occurred just recently. Our thoughts and memories of Christa will always be fresh and comforting.\" In 2017, McAuliffe was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.", "The Christa McAuliffe Prize\nThe Christa McAuliffe Prize The Nebraska Christa McAuliffe Prize For Courage and Excellence in Education is an award given annually to recognize a teacher in Nebraska for showing courage in education.

{"query": "Hōjō Masako historical political actions instead of sympathetic portrayals in novels", "pos": ["Hōjō Masako\nHōjō Masako Hōjō Masako was born in 1156, daughter of Hōjō Tokimasa, leader of the influential Hōjō clan of Izu province, and his wife, Hōjō no Maki. Masako's parents were still in their teens, and she was raised by many ladies-in-waiting and nannies. Masako was born into a world of war and strife. In Kyoto, the capital of Japan, the Hōgen Rebellion was in full swing, where Cloistered Emperor Toba and Emperor Sutoku warred over who would be the next emperor. The Hōjō family wisely chose to stay out of the rebellion, even though the Hōjō family, Masako's lineage, was descended from the Taira clan and thus was related to the imperial family. During the Heiji Rebellion, fought in 1159, the Taira clan, under Taira no Kiyomori, with the support of Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa defeated the Minamoto clan, under the leadership of Minamoto no Yoshitomo. Yoshitomo was executed, while his sons and daughters were either executed or sent to nunneries. Only three of his sons survived. Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori were forced into priesthood, while Minamoto no Yoritomo, at the age of thirteen, was spared and sent to exile in Izu, the domain of Hōjō Tokimasa. While this was happening, Masako was barely an infant. The Taira under Kiyomori now were in successful control of Japan. Masako had an elder brother Munetoki, and in 1163 a younger brother, Yoshitoki, was born. She later would have yet another brother, Hōjō Tokifusa, and another sister, whose name is lost to history. Masako was instructed in horseback riding, hunting, and fishing and she ate with men rather than with her mother, sister, and other women of the household. Masako married Yoritomo. In 1182, they had their first daughter, Ō-Hime. In the same year, a disillusioned Imperial Prince Mochihito, who was the son of Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa and thought the Taira had denied him the throne to offer the throne to Emperor Antoku, who was half Taira himself, called the Minamoto members remaining in Japan to overthrow the Taira. Yoritomo who considered himself the head of the Minamoto, responded. He had the full support of the Hōjō and Tokimasa, not to mention Masako. The Minamoto center was at the city of Kamakura, to the east of Izu in Sagami Province. Thus, the Genpei War, the final war between Minamoto and Taira had begun. In 1180, Masako's elder brother Munetoki was killed at Battle of Ishibashiyama and Yoshitoki became heir of Hōjō clan. In 1181, Taira no Kiyomori died, leaving the Taira in the hands of Taira no Munemori, his son. In 1182, Masako's brother Yoshitoki married, and that same year, Masako and Yoritomo had their first son, Minamoto no Yoriie, who would be the heir. In 1183, Minamoto no Yoshinaka, Yoritomo's rival and cousin, took Kyoto, driving the Taira (and Emperor Antoku) to Shikoku. Quickly, Emperor Go-Toba was installed by the Minamoto. Nonetheless, Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori, Yoritomo's half brothers who had joined Yoritomo drove Yoshinaka out and executed him, and took Kyoto in the name of Yoritomo (and the Hōjō.) By 1185, the Taira were completely defeated at the Battle of Dan-no-ura. Munemori was executed, while the remaining Taira either were executed or drowned, including the young Emperor Antoku. Minamoto no Yoritomo was now the undisputed leader of Japan. Hōjō Masako and her family had stood by Yoritomo through it all. She rode with him on his campaigns and was never defeated in battle. His new allegiance to his wife's family and her dislike of her brothers-in-law as well as an internal power struggle brought up by the three brothers eventually resulted in the arrest and execution of Yoshitsune and Noriyori. Yoritomo even created new titles, such as shugo and jitō, which Hōjō Tokimasa received approval from Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa in Kyoto. The capital was not moved to Kyoto, but remained in Kamakura, away from the court. In 1192, Yoritomo was named \"shōgun\" by Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who died later that year. He was now the most powerful man in Japan, and gave that power over to Masako as well. The Hōjō clan shared in that power. That same year, Masako and Yoritomo had another son, Minamoto no Sanetomo. In 1199, Minamoto no Yoritomo died. He was succeeded as \"shōgun\" by his son, Minamoto no Yoriie. Since he was only eighteen, Hōjō Tokimasa proclaimed himself \"shikken\" or regent for Yoriie. Masako also had a strong position since her son was \"shōgun\". Since her husband was dead, she shaved her head and became a Buddhist nun, receiving a tonsure from the priest Gyōyū. However, she did not take up residence in a monastery or a nunnery, and still involved herself in politics. She, her father Tokimasa, and her brother Yoshitoki created a council of regents for the eighteen-year-old Yoriie, but the headstrong \"shōgun\" hated his mother's family and preferred his wife's family, the Hiki clan, and his father-in-law, Hiki Yoshikazu. Hōjō Masako overheard a plot that Yoshikazu and Yoriie were hatching, and turned in her own son to Tokimasa, who did not hurt Yoriie but had Yoshikazu executed in 1203. Now, \"Shōgun\" Yoriie was very sick and retired to Izu Province. He was murdered in 1204, no doubt by Tokimasa's orders. Masako had not been aware of this. During the murders and purges of the Hiki clan, Minamoto no Ichiman, Yoriie's eldest son and heir and Masako's grandson, was also executed since he was part Hiki himself. In 1203, Masako's other son by Yoritomo, Minamoto no Sanetomo, became the third \"shōgun\" with Tokimasa as regent. Sanetomo was closer to his mother than his elder brother was, and still a child when appointed \"shōgun\", by contrast his brother, who was forced to abdicate as \"shōgun\" was now an adult. Nonetheless, Masako and Yoshitoki, the heir to the Hōjō, were angry with their father, especially after their mother, Hōjō no Maki, died in 1204. Masako's sister's husband, Hatekayama Shigetada, was wrongfully executed on Tokimasa's orders even after Yoshitoki, Masako, and Tokifusa told Tokimasa he was not guilty of the \"treason\" charges. Hōjō Tokimasa was by 1205 the most powerful man in Kamakura. Masako heard rumors that Tokimasa was planning to execute Sanetomo and replace him with one of his allies, so Masako and Yoshitoki immediately ordered Tokimasa to step down and go into priesthood or they would rebel. Hōjō Tokimasa abdicated in 1205, and was sent off to a monastery in Kamakura, where he shaved his head and became a monk, dying in 1215. In 1205, Minamoto no Sanetomo was \"shōgun\", and even though Tokimasa had been ousted, the position of the Hōjō was still secure. Masako's brother, Hōjō Yoshitoki, had succeeded as \"shikken\" for \"shōgun\" Sanetomo, while Masako was in a powerful position as a negotiator with the court. In 1218, she was sent by Regent Yoshitoki to ask Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba if \"shōgun\" Sanetomo could adopt one of his sons, such as Imperial Prince Nagahito as an heir. Go-Toba refused. In 1219, tragedy struck. \"Shōgun\" Sanetomo was executed by his nephew, the younger son of Minamoto no Yoriie, who later was caught by Hōjō troops and himself executed. In 1219, the Minamoto line became extinct. It was being decided who the next \"shōgun\" would be, and Masako and Regent Yoshitoki finally decided on Kujō Yoritsune, otherwise known as Fujiwara no Yoritsune, who was not an adult, but a baby, and also not a Hōjō nor a male-line Minamoto, but rather, a member of the Kujō clan, which was part of the Fujiwara clan. Yoritsune's grandmother has been a niece of 1st \"shōgun\" Yoritomo. He was still a figurehead for the Hōjō, also later in his adulthood. In 1221, Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba rebelled against the Hōjō, trying to restore power to the emperor. Regent Yoshitoki and his eldest son and heir, Hōjō Yasutoki, attacked Kyoto, and managed to regain the city and exile Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba. This was known as the abortive Jōkyū War of 1221. In 1224, Hōjō Yoshitoki died of a sudden illness. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Hōjō Yasutoki, Masako's nephew. Of course, the powerful Miura clan, led by Miura Yoshimura, attempted to topple the Hōjō government of Regent Yasutoki, Masako, and \"shōgun\" Yoritsune, but Masako rushed to negotiate. The Miura were put down, and Regent Yasutoki became Hōjō regent. Finally, in 1225, Hōjō Masako died at the age of 69. Due to her true example of cloistered rule, she was known as the \"ama-shōgun\", or the \"nun-\"shōgun\"\"."], "neg": ["An Artist of the Floating World\nAn Artist of the Floating World An Artist of the Floating World (1986) is a novel by Nobel Prize-winning British author Kazuo Ishiguro. It is set in post-World War II Japan and is narrated by Masuji Ono, an ageing painter, who looks back on his life and how he has lived it. He notices how his once great reputation has faltered since the war and how attitudes towards him and his paintings have changed. The chief conflict deals with Ono's need to accept responsibility for his past actions and in the expostulation to find a path to peace in his good will for the young white collar workers on the streets at lunchbreak. The novel also deals with the role of people in a rapidly changing environment. The novel falls under both historical fiction and global literature (Weltliteratur). It is known as historical fiction due to its basis on remembering the past and it draws from historical facts. It is also known as global literature as it has a broad international market and allows for a study on how the world today is interconnected. Originally published in 1986, it has since won major awards. Published by Faber and Faber it is also printed by publishing companies such as Allen and Unwin and Penguin Vintage International. It has become an eBook version additionally and is available on most eBook websites such as kindle and iBook’s, since 2012. Currently, An Artist of the Floating World, has been translated into over 40 languages around the world. Kazuo Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan in 1954, eventually moving to England at the age of five, only to return to Japan twenty-nine years later. Growing up Ishiguro had a traditionally Japanese mother, who resultantly influenced his writing when reflecting on Japan. Furthermore, his reading of Japanese novels and comicsallowed him to stay connected to his Japanese heritage as well as see the differences between Western and Japanese society, influencing his writing through developing a sense of Japanese ideals. The inclusion of Ichiro’s cowboy obsession stemmed from Ishiguro’s own fascination with cowboys during his youth. Ishiguro was inspired to write \"An Artist of the Floating World\", due to his original novel A Pale View of Hills, which included an old teacher character, that has to rediscover and invent his own morals. This reflects his own consistent rediscovery and invention of himself throughout his youth and adult years. Furthermore, owing to his childhood of moving countries and subsequently not feeling like he ‘fit-in’ he wrote in a very globalised and international way; through writing Ishiguro explored his background and heritage. The novel overall, is a reflection of Ishiguro’s personal feelings of Japanese heritage, a fictional reflection of his sense of identity, as presented through a youthful reconstruction of Japan. The novel's title is based on the literal translation of \"Ukiyo-e\", a word referring to the Japanese art of prints. Therefore, it can be read as \"a printmaker\" or \"an artist living in a changing world,\" given both Ono's limited understanding and the dramatic changes his world, Japan in the first half of the twentieth century, has undergone in his lifetime. The title also refers to an artistic genre. Ono's master was especially interested in depicting scenes from the pleasure district adjacent to the villa in which he and his students lived. Ono mentions the ephemeral nature of the floating world that could be experienced during each night. His master experimented with innovative softer Western-style painting techniques. Ono became estranged from him and forged his own career. He could not help but feel gleeful when his master's paintings fell into disfavour during a return to the use of more traditional bold lines in the paintings used for nationalistic posters. The novel, \"An Artist of the Floating World\", is structured through the interwoven memories of protagonist Masuji Ono. The novel is set in three distinctly different years however, Ono’s memories span as far back to when he was a child. The four different years and title sections of the novel are: October 1948, April 1949, November 1949 and June 1950. In the buildup to World War II, Ono, a promising artist, had broken away from the teaching of his master, whose artistic aim was to reach an aesthetic ideal, and had gotten involved in far-right politics, making propagandistic art. As a member of the Cultural Committee of the Interior Department and official adviser to the Committee of Unpatriotic Activities, Ono had become a police informer, taking an active part in an ideological witch hunt. After the 1945 defeat and the collapse of jingoistic Imperial Japan, Ono has become a discredited figure, one of the \"traitors\" who \"led the country astray\"; meanwhile, the victims of state repression, including people Ono himself had denounced, are reinstated and allowed to lead a normal life. Over the course of the first three sections, spanning October 1948 – November 1949, Ono seems to show a growing acknowledgement of his past \"errors\", although this acknowledgement is never explicitly stated. However, in the short fourth and last section (June 1950), Ono appears to have returned to his earlier inability to change his viewpoint. The book is written in the first person and hinges on the exclusive use of a single, unreliable narrator, expressing a viewpoint which the reader identifies as limited and fallible, without any other voice or point of view acting as a test. Ono often makes it clear that he is not sure of the accuracy of his narrative, but this may either make the reader cautious or, on the contrary, suggest that Ono is very honest and, therefore, trustworthy. The self-image Ono expresses in his narrative is vastly different from the image of him the reader builds from reading the same narrative. Ono often quotes others as expressing admiration and indebtedness to him. Ono's narrative is characterised by denial, so that his interests and his hierarchy of values are at odds with the reader's. Readers, therefore, find that what they are interested in is not the focus of Ono's narrative but at its fringes, presented in an oblique rather than direct fashion. For example, Ono's descriptions of his pictures focus on pictorial technique, mentioning the subjects as if they were unimportant, although they reveal the propagandistic nature of his work. It is not entirely clear whether this focus on style rather than substance should be ascribed to Ono as narrator (showing his retrospective, unconscious embarrassment), or if it was already present in him at the time he was making the pictures (showing that totalitarianism exploits people's capacity to restrain their awareness to limited aspects of their actions). Similarly, when Ono narrates an episode in which he was confronted with the results of his activities as a police informer, it is debatable whether his attempt to mitigate the brutality of the police is a retrospective fabrication devised to avoid his own responsibility, or whether he actually did disapprove of the treatment of the person he had denounced, distancing himself from his actions and refusing to recognise the abusive treatment as a direct and foreseeable consequence of those actions. Masuji Ono is the narrator and protagonist of the novel. He is presented as an elderly artist, father and grandfather to his family. Throughout the novel he is concerned with his youngest daughter’s marriage negotiations. As a child his father was reluctant for him to become a painter, however as he grew older he soon became an artist. He previously worked in his younger years with the nationalist government in the creation of wartime paintings. Presently, whilst his art career before his involvement with propaganda paintings is applauded, his other work is scorned. This results in Ono living a conflicting life. Noriko is Ono’s youngest daughter. She lives with him in his house and is seen as sometimes indignant and bad-mannered. She is somewhat bitter to Ono in the beginning of the novel as she believes he was the core reason as to why her original marriage arrangement was cancelled. However, she soon become enamoured with her second marriage arrangement and is happy when she eventually marries him. Noriko views her father, Ono, as someone she must care for forming a small resentment and anger towards him. Noriko is very outspoken and boisterous throughout the novel, contrasting Setsuko. Setsuko is Ono’s eldest daughter. She is a quiet and traditional woman, who is married to Suichi and has a son named Ichiro. She and Ono have a solid relationship and she helps him throughout the marriage arrangement proceedings and dealing with his guilt post-war; she acts as his listener. Setsuko and Noriko have a strong, sisterly relationship, however they are quite different temperament wise. Ichiro is Ono’s grandson, Setsuko’s child and Noriko’s nephew. He is a young boy in the novel with an active imagination. To Ono, Ichiro can be confusing and alienating owing to his adoption of Western culture such as some English words and his obsession with cowboys and the movie Godzilla. They have a good relationship, and bond over their masculinity frequently. Suichi is Setsuko’s husband and son-in-law to Ono. He represents the new and changing ideals of Japan and is quite outspoken regarding Ono’s role in the war. He frequently speaks out about his opinions regarding the war. Before the war he was seen as a well-mannered and happy man, however post-war he has seen to have changed into a relatively angry and bitter man as a result of his experiences as a soldier. Kuroda was Ono’s protégé and student. They initially had a strong relationship however after ono disapproved of the direction of Kuroda’s art he gave his name to the Committee of Unpatriotic Activities. This results in his paintings getting destroyed and him being punished. He therefore forms a strong dislike for Ono, and never sees him again. Matsuda is characterised as a nationalist who ultimately influences Ono, to create politicised paintings. He disparages artists who do not deal with social and political issues through their art, suggesting them as naïve. After the war, he becomes a sick and elderly individual who Ono visits relatively frequently. He is quite regretful of remaining unmarried and having no heirs to precede him. Seiji Moriyami, also known as Mori-san during the novel, was Ono’s art teacher during his younger years. He is a strong believer in painting the ‘floating world’ and teaches students in his villa. His main artistic technique is the inclusion of Western techniques such using dark lines in favour of shading. He is a stubborn yet nurturing figure, however once students steer away from his techniques, they are soon told to leave. Dr Saito is a major art professor with a high social standing. Ono believes he is well acquainted with his work, however Setsuko disagrees throughout the novel, raising questions as to the validity of his memory. Mrs. Kawakami is the bar owner of which Ono frequent regularly, in the pleasure district of where he lives. She is a good friend of Ono. She remains hopeful throughout the novel that the pleasure district will have a resurrection, however this is not the case and she thus sells her bar by the end. Nakahara, also referred to as ‘The Tortoise’ due to his slow painting, is a friend of Ono’s during his youthful days at Mori-san’s villa. He is mocked by many of Mori-san’s pupils for his slow painting however Ono soon defends him. However, after Ono alters his painting style to become politically associated he distances himself, believing Ono has become a traitor. The first potential husband for Noriko. Noriko’s husband. Was Ono’s wife, however unfortunately died during the war due to a bombing. Was Ono’s son, however unfortunately died during the war. An Artist of the Floating World discusses several themes through the memories of the narrator, Masuji Ono. The analysis of these themes is facilitated through the transcendence of time, allowing the audience’s rumination on Ono’s experiences permitting them to judge the narrative objectively. Many of these themes are interwoven together supporting one another. Among the themes explored in this novel are arranged marriage, the changing roles of women, and the declining status of \"elders\" in Japanese society since 1945. The novel is narrated by a man who, besides being an artist, is also a father, a grandfather, and a widower. It tells, with a strong voice, much about the \"pleasure era\" of Japanese society, elaborating on the life of a successful and devoted young artist in a decadent era. We learn how attitudes toward Japanese art and society became less tolerant of such extravagance, and what it was like to live with the guilt of such pleasure. The pace is slow and lingers over details, reflecting the central theme. Art is a central theme to the novel, with Ono’s role as a propaganda artist the chief story line. Art facilitates the questioning of its ability to influence and inspire action within a community. There is a large conflict between whether art should be politicised or whether it should be simply a source of gratification. Ishiguro both highlights the role of politicised art to be seen as detrimental to society through the impacts of the war, and to be seen as ineffectual and unsubstantial to changing events; the war and its subsequent effect would have occurred with Ono’s propaganda, or without it. This theme bleeds into the scene regarding Kuroda and Ono, ultimately suggesting that the politicisation of art will result in the manufacturing of cruel actions. However, this idea is counteracted through the various scenes between Ono and his daughters who confront the idea of his role as a propagandist being highly involved. This allows both sides of arts argument to be explored facilitating the questioning of arts role. Art is therefore transcended into a defining moment of Japanese history, pre and post war life. Through the novels structure of interwoven memories, Masuji Ono has the ability to unreliably narrate his past. This is seen through a variety of techniques employed by Ishiguro. Firstly, Ono uses digressions in order to mask and disguise his cruel and brutal actions. This can be seen through his lack of directness and intent in the construction of his story, destabilising the audience repeatedly. This technique can be further seen through Ono’s ability to provide a large amount of information on mundane topics and events, misleading the audience to believe other aspects to his story being more important. This allows for him to withhold facts and emotions from the audience, disallowing them to discover the extent of his actions and consequently, his responsibility. Masuji Ono further uses indirectness to disguise events that had occurred. This is particularly apparent through the interactions between family members, as topics will be bypassed or spoken about objectively and without the audience completely comprehending the extent of his story. Whilst Ono begins to explain many topics he eventually always prevents himself from divulging sufficient information. Whilst this helps him to evade the harsh memories, this avoidance is subsequently emphasised to the audience ultimately aiding in their judgement of his character. Finally, Masuji Ono repeatedly reassesses events from his past throughout the novel. This suggests his reassessment of his guilt regarding his actions and decisions, ultimately rethinking the both the role of propaganda and how memories are constructed. It further highlights his unreliability in narrating his story, ultimately emphasising his fickle nature. This is highlighted through various scenes, such as Ono’s belief that a self-portrait is ultimately subjective. This reflects the concept that memory is processed through an individual’s consciousness, making it subjective to that particular person. Similarly, to the theme of the politicisation of art, Ishiguro explores the role of responsibility through the narration of, Masuji Ono. This is identified through the conflict between actions and culpability that is created through Ono’s inability to take responsibility. This is evident through his attempt at masking his actions and the subsequent consequences. Furthermore, \"An Artist of the Floating World\", explores the liability of leaders after the war and how many of them were not held responsible. Alternatively, the concept of responsibility can be considered abstractly. This is done by placing emphasis on the reader to take responsibility in the determining the ending of the novel; is Ono guilty of his actions or is he simply exaggerating his importance and role in the war. The setting on post world war II Japan, was a time of great change. This is reflected in the novel through the changing values. This is presented particularly through the dynamics between Masuji Ono and his grandson Ichiro. Masuji Ono represents pre-war Japan, whilst Ichiro represents post-war Japan and the new generation. Major changes explored are the changing attitudes towards the war, the changing attitudes regarding family hierarchy, geography of Japan and the increase in Western cultures prevalence. These changes are explored as a result of Japan’s defeat in the war, which created a large divide between individuals, and particularly between generations. This is presented through scenes such as between Ichiro and Ono when watching the Godzilla movie, Ichiro’s obsession with cowboys and his lack of interest in Japanese heroes. Ishiguro does not present these changes as either good or bad, instead simply portrays them as reality, allowing the audience to determine their effects on society. Women are portrayed throughout this novel through both the perspective of Ono and the perspective of the changing Japanese society. The concept of Japanese masculinity altered after Japan’s defeat in the war, and whilst changes were made to the role of women, women’s stereotypes were not changed drastically. This is explored throughout the novel through Noriko’s quest for a husband. These changes can be identified through the interactions between Ono’s two daughters, Noriko and Setsuko. Setsuko represents a more traditional Japanese woman whilst, Noriko represents a slightly less conventional woman. Both are presented as equally strong and resilient women, however how they handle situations can be seen as different. This can be seen in scenes such as Noriko speaking about her marriage proposal openly, where Ono’s perceived embarrassment suggests her outspokenness is new and different. Marriage negotiations are the central tenet to this novel. Through the marriage negotiations Ono reflects on his past facilitating the creation of the story. This emphasises Ono's worry about his past impeding on the future of his daughter, Noriko. Overall, the marriage negotiations are the stimulus for Ono to reflect on his past memories. They further facilitate him taking responsibility for his actions as well as allow him to reconsider the changing values of Japan as perhaps positive. They allow for him to admit his mistakes, progressing the narrative and acting as a literary device. \"An Artist of the Floating World\", was received well and soon became a thriving novel. It has since been featured on numerous best sellers lists and books that are a must read. It is seen as an essential novel for everyone to read, ultimately winning numerous prizes and awards, becoming critically acclaimed. The novel was shortlisted for the 1986 Booker Prize and won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for the same year. It further won the Costa book of the year 1986 and was a nominee for ALA best books for young adults and Man booker prize 1986."]}

Based in the heart of the state, the district encompasses most of Marion County and Indianapolis, except for the north side, which is represented by the 5th District. The district is currently represented by Democrat André Carson who won a special election in 2008 to succeed his grandmother Julia Carson following her death in 2007. The district is one of only two congressional districts to be represented by a Muslim in the United States (the other being Keith Ellison of Minnesota's 5th congressional district, based in Minneapolis. This district has not elected a Republican in 18 years, and is considered a safe Democratic seat. The current area of the 7th Congressional District is largely the same as the now eliminated 10th Congressional District (including all of Center Township, now widely regarded as a Democratic stronghold due to its large African American population and gentrified middle class.) Traditionally, the city and the district has been more competitive and much more Republican; in fact, one of the most Republican metropolitan areas in the country, particularly during the years when Richard Lugar and William H. Hudnut III served as Mayor of Indianapolis. However, in recent decades, much of the affluence of the city has begun to migrate to the edges of the city and outer Marion County, which has resulted in the Democratic lean. The northern edge of Marion county - an affluent, strongly conservative area - is not included in the district. The southern and eastern parts of the district include the more modest neighborhoods of the city, which is home to Amtrak's largest repair yard. Since the late 1990s, there has been an influx of Mexican and Hispanic workers to the district, which has further increased its Democratic leanings. Also, as the industrial and financial center of Indiana, the district has been strongly influenced by the politics of the unions in the past; however, their influence over the district has become increasingly marginal in recent years. In recent presidential contests, the district itself has given comfortable margins to Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama. Most recently in 2008, Barack Obama won 71% of the vote in the 7th Congressional District. Prior to the 2002 redistricting, the district referred to a completely different area of Indiana, covering Fountain, Parke, Tippecanoe, Montgomery, Clinton, Boone, Hendricks, Vigo, Clay, Putnam, and Owen counties and parts of Morgan and Hamilton counties. It had a dramatically different political history from the current 7th; it was a solidly Republican and rural area anchored by Terre Haute and Lafayette. After the loss of a congressional seat in 2000 by virtue of that year's census, an ambitious redistricting plan was embarked upon, which was eventually implemented in 2002. As mentioned above, most of the old 10th became the new 7th, while the territory of the old 7th was split 4th Congressional District and the 8th Congressional District. , two former members of the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana's 7th congressional district are alive.

Mary Gay Scanlon won the special election to replace Meehan in the current congress. Susan Wild won the election in the new redrawn district, taking office January 3, 2019.  The district's extreme non-congruity was the result of gerrymandering. On January 22, 2018, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the map violated the state constitution, and in February it issued its own district boundaries for use in the 2018 elections and representation thereafter. Most of the population in the old 7th will become part of a new, heavily Democratic fifth district, while most of the old 15th district will become a new, marginal seventh district. The 2003–2013 version of the District was located in Southeastern Pennsylvania. It contained the western and northwestern suburbs of Philadelphia. It consisted of the majority of Delaware County (except for the City of Chester and some of the eastern boroughs), a portion of Chester County east of West Chester in the affluent Main Line area, and a portion of southern Montgomery County centered on Upper Merion Township. The 2013–2018 version of the District contains most of Delaware County outside of the City of Chester and the heavily African American townships and boroughs in the eastern portion of the county. It also contains parts of central Montgomery County, southern portions of Berks County, southern and central portions of Chester County, and a small portion of eastern Lancaster County. The District as it stood in October 2016 was named on NPR's \"On the Media\" as an egregious example of gerrymandering. The shape of the district was described as \"Goofy kicking Donald Duck. The only point that is essentially contiguous there is Goofy's foot in Donald Duck's rear end. [...] However these district lines are the building blocks of democracy, and when they get as perverted and twisted as this, it leads to deeply undemocratic outcomes.\" \"The Washington Post\" listed it as one of the ten most gerrymandered districts in the country. On February 19, 2018, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania released a new congressional map after lawmakers had failed to agree on a map that would reduce gerrymandering. The map substantially redrew the District.

The name is derived from the Greek \"\"akron\"\" meaning \"summit\" and refers to the presence of a corallite at the tip of each branch of coral. They are commonly known as staghorn corals and are grown in aquaria by reef hobbyists. Staghorn corals are the dominant group of reef builders. They come in many shapes and sizes and can be highly variable in colour and form, even within the same species. Most are either branched or table-top shaped and some are encrusting. Their colours vary between browns, whites, pinks, blues, yellows, greens and purple, depending not only on species but also on the growing conditions. Identification is difficult and requires close examination of the corallites and a biochemical and genetic analysis. There is a corallite at the tip of each branch and, with the exception of \"Astreopora\", these are small with up to twelve septa in two cycles. \"Anacropora\", \"Astreopora\" and \"Montipora\" are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. \"Acropora\" is cosmopolitan and is both common and conspicuous, usually being dominant in Indo-Pacific reefs. \"Enigmopora\" is represented by a single new species, \"Enigmopora darveliensis\", found in Malaysia and the Philippines. Staghorn corals are hermaphrodites.

It is the most widespread of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas, with populations present from South Florida and the coasts of Mexico to as far south as Peru and Venezuela.  The habitat of the American crocodile consists largely of coastal areas. It is also found in river systems, but tends to prefer salinity, resulting in the species congregating in brackish lakes, mangrove swamps, lagoons, cays, and small islands. Other crocodiles also have tolerance to saltwater due to salt glands underneath the tongue, but the American crocodile is the only species other than the saltwater crocodile to commonly live and thrive in saltwater. They can be found on beaches and small island formations without any freshwater source, such as some of the many cays and islets across the Bahamas and the Caribbean. They are also found in hypersaline lakes; one of the largest known populations inhabits the Lago Enriquillo. The American is one of the larger crocodile species. Males can reach lengths of , weighing up to . On average, mature males are more in the range of in length weighing up to about . As with other crocodile species, females are smaller; rarely exceeding in length even in the largest-bodied population. Like any other large crocodilian, the American crocodile is potentially dangerous to humans, though it tends not to be as aggressive as some other species. Georges Cuvier originally described the species as \"Crocodylus acutus\" in 1807. Over time, it became known as the \"sharp-snout alligator\". In 1822, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque postulated that the species was in fact a crocodile. The species was redescribed as \"Crocodylus floridanus\" by William T. Hornaday in 1875, when Hornaday and C.E. Jackson were sent to Florida to collect alligator hides. Upon hearing of a \"big old gator\" in Arch Creek at the head of Biscayne Bay, Hornaday and his companions searched for it and reported: In a few hours, we got sight of him, out on the bank in a saw-grass wallow. He was a monster for size—a perfect whale of a saurian, gray in color—and by all the powers, he was a genuine crocodile! \"Crocodylus floridanus\" is now considered an invalid junior synonym of \"C. acutus\". Like all true crocodilians, the American crocodile is a quadruped, with four short, stocky legs; a long, powerful tail; and a scaly hide with rows of ossified scutes running down its back and tail. Its snout is elongated and includes a strong pair of jaws. Its eyes have nictitating membranes for protection along with lacrimal glands, which produce tears. The nostrils, eyes, and ears are situated on the top of its head, so the rest of the body can be concealed underwater for surprise attacks. Camouflage also helps it prey on food. The snout is longer and narrower than that of the American alligator, but broader on average than that of the Orinoco crocodile. American crocodiles are also paler and more grayish than the relatively dark-hued American alligator. This crocodile species normally crawls on its belly, but it can also \"high walk\". Larger specimens can charge up to nearly . They can swim at as much as by moving their bodies and tails in a sinuous fashion, but they cannot sustain this speed. Adults have a uniform grayish-green coloration with white or yellow undersides, while juveniles have dark cross-banding on the tail and back. Despite their large size, American crocodiles do not regularly attack large animals, as most large crocodilians do. Fish, reptiles, birds and small mammals make up the majority of their diet. On occasion, large mammals such as deer and cattle are taken. Their dietary habits in coastal regions are not well studied.  New hatchlings are about in length and about in mass. The average adult in the continental rivers can range from long and weigh up to in males, while females can range from and weigh up to , the lower total length representing their average size at sexual maturity, the upper representing the expected upper size limit for the respective sex in most known populations. In the Tárcoles River in Costa Rica, dozens of and a few individuals frequent bridge crossings (where they are fed daily, which may have helped them reach such consistently large sizes) and are a popular tourist attraction. This species is said to grow largest in the South American river basins, but rarely exceed or reach even there. American crocodiles on the islands or coasts are usually much smaller in size. Adult weight in coastal Belize averaged per one study. In their Florida range, adult length has been recorded as high as , but adult males on average measure long, perhaps slightly smaller than mature males from other continental populations. Common weights of adult American crocodiles in Florida may range from with corresponding lengths of . With extensive conservation efforts underway, there appears to be an increase in the number of large American crocodiles in Florida exceeding in length. On average, the American crocodiles found in Florida are somewhat longer in total length than the American alligator, but large mature American alligators are frequently bulkier and heavier than American crocodiles of similar length. Also, American alligators rarely reach or exceed whereas in populations such as those in Central and South America, this might be around the average size for mature adult males of the American crocodile. A skull of this species was found to measure and is estimated to have belonged to an American crocodile of in length. Large, mature males regularly weigh about 400–500 kg (880–1100 lb), with the individuals of six or more meters surpassing 1000 kg (2,200 lb). Two biologists working with the History Channel series \"MonsterQuest\" filmed an American crocodile they estimated to be , deep within Everglades National Park in Florida. \"C. acutus\" is the most widespread of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas. It inhabits waters such as mangrove swamps, river mouths, fresh waters, and salt lakes, and can even be found at sea, hence its wide distribution throughout the Caribbean islands, southern Florida, the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, Central America, and the South American countries of Colombia and Ecuador. The American crocodile is especially plentiful in Costa Rica. One of its largest documented populations is in Lago Enriquillo, a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic. The species has also been recorded in Jamaica. American crocodiles have recently been sighted in Grand Cayman, leading experts to believe the species may be swimming from Cuba (which is home to a massive American crocodile population) and slowly repopulating Grand Cayman. In addition, an American crocodile/Cuban crocodile hybrid was recently discovered in the Cancún area. The crocodile likely originated in the Zapata Swamp of Cuba (the only place where these wild hybrids exist) and swam to the Yucatán Peninsula.  The American crocodile's saline tolerance also allowed it to colonize limited portions of the United States (extreme southern Florida). Contrary to popular misinformation, the presence of the American alligator is not the reason the American crocodile was unable to populate brackish waters north of Florida, but rather the climate. Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is generally limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s. American crocodiles, unlike American alligators, are extremely susceptible to cold temperatures and live exclusively within tropical waters. During 2009, unusually cold weather in southern Florida resulted in the deaths of about 150 wild American crocodiles, including a well-known crocodile that inhabited Sanibel Island, far north of the species' natural range. American crocodiles in the United States coexist with the American alligator, and are primarily found south of the latitude of Miami, in Everglades National Park, Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Florida Keys. A sizable population occurs near Homestead, at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station. Some individuals have been sighted in Palm Beach, Pinellas and Sarasota Counties. In the summer of 2008, an American crocodile was captured in the surf on Isle of Palms, South Carolina.  The American crocodile is saltwater-tolerant and have thus been capable of colonizing a multitude of islands within the Caribbean islands and on some coastal Pacific islands as well. They coexist with the smaller spectacled caiman within Central America. The only other crocodiles present within the American crocodile's range are Morelet's crocodile and the critically endangered Cuban crocodile. American crocodiles are more susceptible to cold weather than American alligators. While an American alligator can survive in water temperatures of and below for some time, an American crocodile in that environment would lose consciousness and drown due to hypothermia. American crocodiles, however, have a faster growth rate than alligators, and are much more tolerant of saltwater.  Cleaning symbiosis involving the American crocodile as client has been described. Unlike the Old World crocodiles, which are sometimes cleared of parasites by birds, the American crocodile relies more on fish for parasite removal. American crocodiles are apex predators, and any aquatic or terrestrial animal they encounter in freshwater, riparian and coastal saltwater habitats is potential prey.  The snout of the American crocodile is broader than some specialized fish-eating crocodilians (e.g., gharials and freshwater crocodiles), allowing it to supplement its diet with a wider variety of prey. In addition the snout gets even broader and bulkier as the animal matures, a sign for a shift in prey items. Prey species have ranged in size from the insects taken by young American crocodiles to full-grown cattle taken by large adults, and can include various birds, mammals, turtles, crabs, snails, frogs, and occasionally carrion. In Haiti, hatchling and juvenile American crocodiles lived primarily off of fiddler crabs (\"Uca\" ssp.), making up 33.8% and 62.3% of the diet by weight, respectively. Elsewhere, aquatic insects and their larvae and snails are near the top of the food list for American crocodiles at this very early age. Immature and subadult American crocodiles, per a study in Mexico, have a more diverse diet that can include insects, fish, frogs, small turtles, birds and small mammals. One specimen of had a catfish, a mourning dove and a bare-tailed woolly opossum in its stomach. In Florida, bass, tarpon and especially mullet, large crabs, snakes, mammals that habit the riparian and coastal regions of the Everglades, such as opossums and raccoons appeared to be the primary prey of American crocodiles. In Haiti, adults appeared to live largely off of various birds, including herons, storks, flamingos, pelicans, grebes, coots and moorhens ), followed by concentrations of marine fish including \"Tilapia\" and \"Cichlasoma\", at times being seen to capture turtles, dogs and goats. One adult from Honduras had stomach contents consisting of a crocodile of its own species, a turtle shell and peccary hooves. It was noted that historically in Mexico that, among several local farmers, the capturing of livestock by American crocodiles has been a source of some conflict between humans and American crocodiles and large adults occasionally can become habitual predators of goats, dogs, pigs and cattle. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, most prey that could be determined was fish for sub-adults and adults with sub-adults having a broader prey base than either younger or adult crocodiles. In Costa Rica, American crocodiles have been recorded hunting and killing adult female olive ridley sea turtles (\"Lepidochelys olivacea\") when they come to nest around beaches. Reportedly, these American crocodiles hunt primarily in the first few hours after nightfall, especially on moonless nights, although they will feed at any time. It hunts in the typical way for most crocodilian, ambushing terrestrial prey when it comes to edge of the water or is sitting in shallows and dragging it down to be drowned or attempting to ambush aquatic prey from near the surface of the water. Adult American crocodiles have no natural predators. They are known predators of lemon sharks, and sharks avoid areas with American crocodiles. Nonetheless, a single recorded fatality was reported for a small adult American crocodile when a great white shark killed the American crocodile as it was swimming out at sea.  Usually American crocodiles are dominant over and more behaviorally aggressive than American alligators. However, on one occasion, an American crocodile in a Florida zoo escaped its cage and started a fight with a large male American alligator in a bordering pen and was killed by the American alligator. Conversely, there is one confirmed case of an American crocodile preying on a sub-adult American alligator in the wild in Florida. American alligators and American crocodiles do not often come into conflict in the wild, due largely to habitat partitioning and largely separate distributions.  There are several records of American crocodiles killing and eating spectacled caimans in South America. Areas with healthy American crocodile populations often hold only limited numbers of spectacled caimans, while conversely areas that formerly held American crocodiles but where they are now heavily depleted or are locally extinct show a growth of caiman numbers, due to less competition as well as predation. In areas where the two species coexist, the smaller but more aggressive Cuban crocodile is behaviorally dominant over the larger American crocodile. In Mexico, some Morelet's crocodile individuals have escaped from captivity, establishing feral populations and creating a problem for the populations of American crocodile, which must compete with this invasive species. American crocodiles breed in late fall or early winter, engaging in drawn-out mating ceremonies in which males emit low-frequency bellows to attract females. Body size is more important than age in determining reproductive capabilities, and females reach sexual maturity at a length of about . In February or March, gravid females will begin to create nests of sand, mud, and dead vegetation along the water's edge. Nest location is crucial, and with the correct amount of vegetation, the eggs will develop within a small temperature range. Because sex determination is temperature-dependent in crocodilians, slight aberrations in temperature may result in all-male or all-female clutches, which would possibly harm the health of the population. About one month later, when it is time to lay, the female will dig a wide hole diagonally into the side of the nest and lay 30 to 70 eggs in it, depending on her size. After laying, the female may cover the eggs with debris or leave them uncovered. The white, elongated eggs are long and wide and have a number of pores in the brittle shell.  During the 75- to 80-day incubation period, the parents will guard the nest, often inhabiting a hole in the bank nearby. Females especially have been known to guard their nests with ferocity. But in spite of these precautions, American crocodile eggs sometimes fall prey to raccoons (arguably the most virulent natural predator of crocodilian nests in the Americas), coatis, foxes, skunks or other scavenging mammals (including coyotes in Mexico and American black bears in southern Florida), as well as large predatory ants, crabs and vultures. In Panama, green iguana were seen to dig up and prey on American crocodile eggs occasionally, although in several cases were caught by the mother American crocodile and subsequently consumed. Crocodilian eggs are somewhat brittle, but softer than bird eggs. Young of this species hatch after 75–80 days. This species exists mostly in tropical areas with distinct rainy seasons, and the young hatch near the time of the first rains of the summer (July–August), after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother American crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young American crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered. Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up with her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source. The hatchlings, which are in length, have been reported to actively hunt prey within a few days of hatching. It is not uncommon for the mother to care for her young even weeks after they have hatched, remaining attentive to their calls and continuing to provide transportation. About five weeks after hatching, the young American crocodiles disband in search of their own independent lives. Most of them will not survive, being preyed upon by several types of raptorial birds and larger fishes (e.g., barred catfish, Atlantic tarpons, common snook and lemon sharks, boa constrictors, black spiny-tailed iguanas and spectacled caimans). Those that do survive grow rapidly, feeding on insects, fish and frogs. Additionally, some young American crocodiles feed on each other. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as vulnerable, but it has not been assessed since 1996. On March 20, 2007, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service declassified the American crocodile as an endangered species, changing its status to \"threatened\". It remains protected from poaching and killing under the federal Endangered Species Act.  Because of hide hunting, pollution, loss of habitat, and commercial farming, the American crocodile is endangered in parts of its range. As a result of overhunting in the 1950s and 1960s, Venezuela banned commercial crocodile skin harvesting for a decade starting in 1972. In southern Florida, about two-thirds of American crocodile deaths are attributed to road collisions, about 10% to intentional killing, and only about 5% to natural causes. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 American crocodiles live in Mexico, Central America and South America, but population data is limited. An additional 500 to 1,200 are believed to live in southern Florida.  An IUCN study found that the American crocodile was responsible for more reported attacks on humans than any other crocodilian from the Americas. However, it poses less of a threat to humans than saltwater and Nile crocodiles.  There were 36 documented American crocodile attacks in and around Cancún from 1995 to 2017, as well as several in the Barra Santa Ana estuary near Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. The first documented wild crocodile attack on a human in Florida occurred in 2014 in Coral Gables."]}

Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, the show was created by Bryan Fuller for the Showtime cable network, where it ran for two seasons (2003–04). Fuller left the show five episodes into Season 1 because of creative differences; creative direction was taken over by executive producers John Masius and Stephen Godchaux. A direct-to-DVD movie titled \"\" was released on February 17, 2009, with an option to restart the series. Eighteen-year-old Georgia \"George\" Lass (Ellen Muth) is the show's protagonist and narrator. George dies early in the pilot episode and becomes one of the \"undead\", a \"grim reaper\". George soon learns that a reaper's job is to remove the souls of people, preferably just \"before\" they die, and escort them until they move on into their afterlife. George's death leaves behind her mother (Cynthia Stevenson) and the rest of her family at a point when her relationships with them were on shaky ground. The show explores the experiences of a small team of such reapers, as well as the changes in George and her family as they deal with George's death. The first scene of the pilot episode introduces an origin-of-death myth where at the dawn of time, God (busy with creation) gave Toad a clay jar containing death which Toad promised to guard. Frog begged Toad to hold the jar, something to which Toad finally agreed. An excited Frog juggled the jar and finally dropped it, shattering it on the ground. When it broke open, death got out. Georgia Lass is aloof and emotionally distant from her family and shies away from her life. After dropping out of college, she takes a temp job through Happy Time Temporary Services. During her lunch break on her first day, she is hit and killed by a toilet seat falling from the deorbiting Mir space station. She is soon informed that, rather than moving on to the \"great beyond\", she will become a grim reaper in the External Influence Division, collecting souls of people who die in accidents (many of which have a Rube Goldberg-style complexity), and homicides. Each reaper has a secret quota of souls; and, once the quota is met, the reaper moves on to another realm and the last soul reaped then takes his or her job collecting souls. In Season 1, George has trouble adjusting to her circumstances—collecting souls while holding down a day job. By Season 2, she has mostly adjusted to her new role, with few unresolved issues with her life and her afterlife. George's family is struggling to deal with her death. Her mother, Joy, is depressed, and visibly repressing it. Her father, Clancy (Greg Kean), is having an affair. Her sister, Reggie (Britt McKillip), acts out – stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school and hanging them on a tree – until her mother sends her to therapy. Reggie clings to the belief that George visits her, but she is starting to lie to cover this up. At the start of Season 2, the family begins to break apart as Joy and Clancy divorce. All of the main characters have issues with their life after death, but they cope with it in different ways: Mason (Callum Blue) resorts to alcohol and drugs; Daisy (Laura Harris) puts on a veneer of perkiness; and Roxy (Jasmine Guy) is physically and verbally aggressive. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) and George are more straightforward about their sadness. Bryan Fuller left early Season 1 because of conflicts with MGM Television, including disagreement over major script and storyline cuts considered important to the main theme. He stated that the \"lack of professionalism...made it really difficult. It was like being at war. They were constantly trying to strong arm me. It was the worst experience of my life.\" According to Fuller, Showtime canceled the show due to \"a loss of quality and a sense the problems would continue.\" Actress Rebecca Gayheart also departed the show after the series' fifth episode.   In the world of \"Dead Like Me\", grim reapers do not wear black cloaks or carry scythes (cloaks and scythes are only featured during the opening credits, for humorous effect), but their role remains traditional: they remove the souls of the living shortly before death and escort them into their afterlife. One becomes a reaper by being the last soul collected when one's own reaper meets his or her secret quota. In the series, Death has a list of who is scheduled to die and when. This list is delivered to the head of each group by a shadowy figure (when the delivery is made to Rube's apartment; it is shown that the delivery is made by an actual shadow, with the list of names becoming corporeal only when it is delivered). The head of each group then gives each reaper a non-transferable assignment to collect a particular soul or souls. Completing that assignment is often difficult for the reapers, who receive only the first (and sometimes middle) initial and last name of the person about to die, the location, and estimated time of death (ETD). If a reaper refuses to take a soul at their place of death and the person somehow survives their appointed time, the soul will \"wither and die and rot inside\" them. If a reaper does not take a soul and the person does die, the soul remains trapped in the body and is subject to extremely traumatic experiences such as witnessing the autopsy of their own body. Deaths can be at least temporarily postponed without risk to the soul's well-being by interfering well in advance of the time of death; thus reapers would not be interfering with the events that lead to the death. However, this may have unintended consequences, such as other people dying because of actions taken by the person who should have died. Reapers have a physical body and may interact with the living and the dead. Besides collecting souls, reapers have powers to remain ageless, heal extremely quickly (George once severed her middle finger, but was able to reattach it by just putting it back in place, while Mason has sustained what should have been fatal damage on multiple occasions, such as being shot and hit by a car), drink alcohol without suffering a hangover (see \"Gravelings\"), and forcibly pull a soul from a living body and replace it (as seen done by Roxy in Episode 9 \"Sunday Mornings\"). When seen by the living, reapers' physical appearances are different from when they were alive to those who knew them, except on Halloween when the living see them as they were in life, and fellow reapers always see their original appearances. Although George is seen by her family and Delores as \"Millie,\" Rube's image was recognizable by a records clerk in a wanted poster seen while Rube and the clerk were doing some research into his past life. Laura Boddington portrays lead character George's 'undead' appearance in the TV series, with Jennifer Rae Westley playing her in the later film. Supporting evidence that others can see their \"original\" faces is upheld by Kiffany, who does not notice any alterations to their appearances on Halloween, and by numerous one-off characters who comment on George's physical appearance (brown eyes, etc.) that would not match her 'undead' appearance. The passage into the afterlife is shown as a brightly lit scene towards which the newly deceased is drawn. The portal is unique to each soul: for a child, it may be a wonderful carnival, but for a yoga master, it may be a Deva beckoning from within a Divine Lotus. Souls cannot be forced to enter the portals, so part of the reapers' job is to convince them to do so. Groups of reapers are organized into \"divisions\" according to various causes of death. Generally, reapers are assigned to a division based upon their own cause of death; Mason tells George in a deleted scene that most of the members of the Plague Division died because of the Plague. In addition to Rube's \"external influence\" team, the three other divisions mentioned in the series are Circulatory Systems Division, the very uneventful and bored reapers of the Plague Division (who spend much of their time playing bocce ball) and the Natural Causes (Old Age) Division mentioned in the 27th and 28th episodes (according to the running order). (In the pilot episode, the viewer is led to believe that the Plague Division members have been reapers for centuries and will be unable to meet their quota, as plague deaths have become so rare.) While the members of Rube's team of reapers are instructed to never reap animals, George (and Reggie) do meet a child reaper who reaps the souls of animals — suggesting that there may be a fourth division that exists for this purpose. The teams are organized into jurisdictions of geographical areas, with several teams associated with different causes of death operating within one area. It is not known how much geographical area a single division covers, but the reapers in the series seem to cover only a limited area in Seattle and King County, Washington; with reaper Daisy Adair transferring from the SoHo area of New York City. In the show, reapers do not actually kill the living. Instead, deaths are arranged by 'gravelings'. Gravelings are mischievous gremlin-like creatures that cause the accidents and mishaps (in the form of Rube Goldberg machine scenarios) that kill people. The living generally cannot see them, though in the episode \"Reaper Madness\", a schizophrenic was able to, although Rube refused to believe that was possible. Reapers can see and interact with them to some extent: Daisy once shushed a graveling; Rube yelled \"Get outta here!\" once when seeing gravelings desecrating a cemetery statue; and George once chased several angry gravelings around her apartment. Although gravelings seem to be self-aware and recognize the reapers, they do not communicate verbally with them, and talk to each other in a hushed and unintelligible babble; other times they growl or hiss. According to the episode \"Vacation\", gravelings are given one day off every few years. Despite the holiday, most reapers are disturbed by their lack of manners and behavior. During this time they display the odd habit of stacking objects into precarious, humanoid towers. In the episode \"Reapercussions\" (Season 1 Episode 4), it is noted that if a reaper interferes with and prevents a scheduled death, a \"hunting season\" will be declared by the gravelings, who will pester the reaper until that soul is taken and order is restored. Some of the reapers, including George, Roxy, Mason, and Daisy, are plagued by the wrath of gravelings throughout the series. A graveling rose from the body of Ray in \"Forget Me Not\" (Season 2, Episode 12) following his murder at the hands of a reaper. This graveling retained Ray's mind or some other connection to his life, as it stayed close to Daisy and George's house (where Ray was killed) and expressed anger toward Daisy and Mason for Ray's death. It was also responsible for an unscheduled death at one of Daisy's reaps. Later, in the episode \"Always\" (Season 2 Episode 14), the graveling was reaped by George, upon which it turned to dust. There is evidence that George was able to see gravelings when she was a child; in the episode \"The Shallow End\" (Season 2, Episode 4) George sees gravelings as she sinks into a swimming pool, with the gravelings appearing to hesitate from claiming her life (although it is not clear whether she actually saw the gravelings), and again in \"Haunted\" (Season 2, Episode 15) George recalls a Halloween afternoon during her youth when as a young girl she saw a graveling scurrying around in the background behind a man who, after she became a reaper, she realizes is a serial killer. Viewers are told that in the beginning, god (\"lowercase \"g\",\" as explicitly stated in the narration) created death and, not knowing what to do with it, kept it in a sealed urn. Toad was asked by god to watch the urn but Frog pestered Toad into giving it to him. Frog proceeded to juggle the jar from foot to foot and accidentally dropped it, thus letting 'death' out, whereby everything from that point on had to die. As a symbolic reference to this story, George is frequently shown caring for an albino Argentine horned frog (also known as a Pacman frog) identical to the one shown as Toad during the opening narration. On April 18, 2007, MGM announced that they were developing several direct-to-DVD movies and sequels. First among them was a new film based on \"Dead Like Me\". The movie is set five years after the first series episode. The movie's release date was originally set for the summer of 2008, then changed to February 17, 2009. An exclusive television debut occurred on January 16, 2009 on SuperChannel in Canada. In the movie, the role of Daisy is played by Sarah Wynter. Rube does not appear (he reportedly had moved on), but is mentioned by the characters; the new leader of the reapers is Cameron Kane, played by Henry Ian Cusick. La-La Land Records released a soundtrack containing the original score to the series composed by Stewart Copeland on May 25, 2010, as a limited release of 3000 units. The show's complete ratings were not released, though executives had claimed to at least one reporter that \"Dead Like Me\" had ratings three times Showtime's primetime average. This contrasts with the network's statement that the ratings were not high enough for a third season. The ratings for the series premiere were 1.11 million, a record for a Showtime series premiere that was not beaten until the premiere of \"Shameless\" seven years later."], "neg": ["Dead to Me (TV series)\nDead to Me (TV series) Dead to Me is an upcoming American dark comedy web television series created by Liz Feldman that is set to premiere on Netflix.

{"query": "Random variable applications in finance instead of information theory.", "pos": ["Random variate\nRandom variate In the mathematical fields of probability and statistics, a random variate is a particular outcome of a random variable: the random variates which are other outcomes of the same random variable might have different values. Random variates are used when simulating processes driven by random influences (stochastic processes). In modern applications, such simulations would derive random variates corresponding to any given probability distribution from computer procedures designed to create random variates corresponding to a uniform distribution, where these procedures would actually provide values chosen from a uniform distribution of pseudorandom numbers. Procedures to generate random variates corresponding to a given distribution are known as procedures for \"random variate generation\" or pseudo-random number sampling. In probability theory, a random variable is a measurable function from a probability space to a measurable space of values that the variable can take on. In that context, and in statistics, those values are known as a random variates, or occasionally random deviates, and this represents a wider meaning than just that associated with pseudorandom numbers. Devroye defines a random variate generation algorithm (for real numbers) as follows: The distinction between \"random variable\" and \"random variate\" is subtle and is not always made in the literature. It is useful when one wants to distinguish between a random variable itself with an associated probability distribution on the one hand, and random draws from that probability distribution on the other, in particular when those draws are ultimately derived by floating-point arithmetic from a pseudo-random sequence. For the generation of uniform random variates, see Random number generation. For the generation of non-uniform random variates, see Pseudo-random number sampling.", "Computational finance\nComputational finance Computational finance is a branch of applied computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance. Some slightly different definitions are the study of data and algorithms currently used in finance and the mathematics of computer programs that realize financial models or systems. Computational finance emphasizes practical numerical methods rather than mathematical proofs and focuses on techniques that apply directly to economic analyses. It is an interdisciplinary field between mathematical finance and numerical methods. Two major areas are efficient and accurate computation of fair values of financial securities and the modeling of stochastic price series. The birth of computational finance as a discipline can be traced to Harry Markowitz in the early 1950s. Markowitz conceived of the portfolio selection problem as an exercise in mean-variance optimization. This required more computer power than was available at the time, so he worked on useful algorithms for approximate solutions. Mathematical finance began with the same insight, but diverged by making simplifying assumptions to express relations in simple closed forms that did not require sophisticated computer science to evaluate. In the 1960s, hedge fund managers such as Ed Thorp and Michael Goodkin (working with Harry Markowitz, Paul Samuelson and Robert C. Merton) pioneered the use of computers in arbitrage trading. In academics, sophisticated computer processing was needed by researchers such as Eugene Fama in order to analyze large amounts of financial data in support of the efficient-market hypothesis. During the 1970s, the main focus of computational finance shifted to options pricing and analyzing mortgage securitizations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a group of young quantitative practitioners who became known as “rocket scientists” arrived on Wall Street and brought along personal computers. This led to an explosion of both the amount and variety of computational finance applications. Many of the new techniques came from signal processing and speech recognition rather than traditional fields of computational economics like optimization and time series analysis. By the end of the 1980s, the winding down of the Cold War brought a large group of displaced physicists and applied mathematicians, many from behind the Iron Curtain, into finance. These people become known as “financial engineers” (“quant” is a term that includes both rocket scientists and financial engineers, as well as quantitative portfolio managers). This led to a second major extension of the range of computational methods used in finance, also a move away from personal computers to mainframes and supercomputers. Around this time computational finance became recognized as a distinct academic subfield. The first degree program in computational finance was offered by Carnegie Mellon University in 1994.  Over the last 20 years, the field of computational finance has expanded into virtually every area of finance, and the demand for practitioners has grown dramatically. Moreover, many specialized companies have grown up to supply computational finance software and services.", "Financial risk modeling\nFinancial risk modeling Financial risk modeling is the use of formal econometric techniques to determine the aggregate risk in a financial portfolio. Risk modeling is one of many subtasks within the broader area of financial modeling. Risk modeling uses a variety of techniques including market risk, value at risk (VaR), historical simulation (HS), or extreme value theory (EVT) in order to analyze a portfolio and make forecasts of the likely losses that would be incurred for a variety of risks. Such risks are typically grouped into credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk categories. Many large financial intermediary firms use risk modeling to help portfolio managers assess the amount of capital reserves to maintain, and to help guide their purchases and sales of various classes of financial assets.  Formal risk modeling is required under the Basel II proposal for all the major international banking institutions by the various national depository institution regulators. In the past, risk analysis was done qualitatively but now with the advent of powerful computing software, quantitative risk analysis can be done quickly and effortlessly. Modeling the changes by distributions with finite variance is now known to be inappropriate. Benoît Mandelbrot found in the 1960s that changes in prices in financial markets do not follow a Gaussian distribution, but are rather modeled better by Lévy stable distributions. The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time interval to a power a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down, also called \"fat tails\", are more likely than what one would calculate using a Gaussian distribution with an estimated standard deviation. Quantitative risk analysis and its modeling have been under question in the light of corporate scandals in the past few years (most notably, Enron), Basel II, the revised FAS 123R and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and for their failure to predict the financial crash of 2008."], "neg": ["Experimental finance\nExperimental finance The goals of experimental finance are to understand human and market behavior in settings relevant to finance. Experiments are synthetic economic environments created by researchers specifically to answer research questions. This might involve, for example, establishing different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanism and returns processes. Fields to which experimental methods have been applied include corporate finance, asset pricing, financial econometrics, international finance, personal financial decision-making, macro-finance, banking and financial intermediation, capital markets, risk management and insurance, derivatives, quantitative finance, corporate governance and compensation, investments, market mechanisms, SME and microfinance and entrepreneurial finance.  Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and attempt to discover new principles on which theory can be extended. Experimental finance is a branch of experimental economics and its most common use lies in the field of behavioral finance. In 1948, Chamberlin reported results of the first market experiment. Since then the acceptability, recognition, role, and methods of experimental economics have evolved.  From the early 1980s on a similar pattern emerged in experimental finance. The foundational work in experimental finance was the work of Forsythe, Palfrey and Plott (1980), Plott and Sunder (1982), and Smith, Suchanek and Williams (1988). Financial economics has one of the most detailed and updated observational data available of all branches of economics. Consequently, finance is characterized by strong empirical traditions. Lots of analysis is done on data from stock exchanges including bids, asks, transaction prices, volume, etc. There is also data available from information services on actions and events that may influence markets. Data from these sources is not able to report on expectations, on which theory of financial markets is built. In experimental markets the researcher is able to know expectations, and control fundamental values, trading institutions, and market parameters such as available liquidity and the total stock of the asset. This gives the researcher the ability to know the price and other predictions of alternative theories. This creates the opportunity to do powerful tests on the robustness of theories which were not possible from field data, since there is little knowledge on the parameters and expectations from field data. Financial data analysis is based on data drawn from settings created for a purpose other than answering a specific research question. This results in the situation where any interpretation of the results may be challenged since it ignores other variables that have changed. Traditional data analysis issues include omitted-variables biases, self-selection biases, unobservable independent variables, and unobservable dependent variables. Properly designed experiments are able to avoid several problems: Omitted-variables bias: Multiple experiments can be created with settings that differ from one another in exactly one independent variable. This way all other variables of the setting are controlled, which eliminates alternative explanations for observed differences in the dependent variable. Self-selection: By randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups, the experimenters avoid issues caused by self-selection and are able to directly observe the changes in the dependent variable by changing by altering certain independent variables. Unobservable independent variables: Experimentalists can create experimental settings themselves. This makes them able to observe all variables. Traditional data analysis may not be able to observe some variables, but sometimes experimenters cannot directly elicit certain information from subjects either. Without directly knowing a certain independent variable, good experimental design can create measures that to a large extent reflects the unobservable independent variable and the problem is therefore avoided. Unobservable dependent variables: In traditional data studies, extracting the cause for the dependent variable to change may prove to be difficult. Experimentalists have the ability to create certain tasks that elicit the dependent variable. Laboratory experiments are the most common form of experimentation. Here the idea is to construct a highly controlled setting in a laboratory. The use of lab experiments increased due to growing interest in issues such as economic cooperation, trust, and neuroeconomics. In this type of experiments, treatment is assigned randomly to a group of individuals in order to compare their economic actions and behavior to an untreated control group within the artificial laboratory environment. The ability to control the variables in the experiment provides for more accurate assessment of causality. Controlled field experiments also randomize treatments but do so in real world applications. Average effects on people's behavior can then be consistently estimated by comparing behavior before and after the allocation. A natural experiment happens when some feature of the real world is randomly changed which allows using the exogenous variation due to this change to study causal effects of an otherwise endogenous explanatory variable. Natural experiments are popular in economic and finance research since they offer intuitive interpretation of the underlying identifying assumptions and enable a broader audience to check their consistency, this compared to purely statistical identification. Experimental methods in finance offer complementary methodologies that have allowed for the observation and manipulation of underlying determinants of prices, such as fundamental values or insider information. Experimental studies complement empirical work, particularly in the area of theory testing and development. Exploiting this experimental methodology has revealed some important findings over the past years. These findings could not have been reached by traditional field data analysis alone and are therefore experimental finance’s main contributions to the field of finance:"]}

The Ancient Church of the East distinguished itself from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1964. It is one of the Assyrian churches that claim continuity with the historical Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon – the Church of the East, one of the oldest Christian churches in Mesopotamia. The church is headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq. In 1970, Catholicos-Patriarch Addai II Giwargis succeeded Thoma Darmo (1968–1969). In 2015, while the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East was vacant following the death of Dinkha IV, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphaël I Sako proposed a \"merger\" or reunion of his own Chaldean Catholic Church with both the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East to (re-)create one united \"Church of the East\" with a single patriarch in full communion with the Pope. The proposal did not go forward, and the Assyrian Church of the East elected a new patriarch of its own. The Ancient Church of the East emerged as the result of a schism within the Assyrian Church of the East, in opposition to reforms introduced by Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai of the Assyrian Church of the East, including the substitution of the modern Gregorian Calendar in place of the traditional Julian Calendar (which differs from the Gregorian by a widening number of days, currently thirteen). The Ancient Church of the East seated itself in Baghdad, Iraq, headed by a separate Catholicos-Patriarch. Following the schism, the position of Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East remained vacant from 1964 until 1968, when Mar Thoma Darmo was named the church's Patriarch. Mar Thoma was elected as a rival Catholicos-Patriarch to Mar Eshai Shimun, who continued to serve as the official head of the Assyrian Church of the East headquartered in the United States. The elected Catholicos-Patriarch Mar Thoma was a native of Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), and a former Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East based in Thrissur, India. Mar Thoma served as Metropolitan from 1952 until his resignation in 1964. Upon becoming the head of the newly formed Ancient Church of the East, he immediately relocated to Baghdad. In September 1968, Mar Addai Giwargis was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan of Iraq. Similarly, Mar Aprem Mooken was consecrated Metropolitan of India, and Mar Poulose Poulose was consecrated Bishop of India. These prelates in turn consecrated Mar Thoma Darmo Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East during the first week of October 1968. Mar Thoma then became the first Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East. Mar Thoma served as Patriarch for just under a year before his death in September 1969. Following Patriarch Mar Thoma Darmo's death in 1969, Mar Addai II assumed the position of Acting Patriarch, and was later elected to lead the Ancient Church of the East in February 1970. In the meantime, he consecrated two Metropolitans, both in December 1969: Mar Narsai Toma was consecrated as Metropolitan of Kirkuk, and Mar Toma Eramia was consecrated Metropolitan of Nineveh (Mosul) and Northern Iraq. Mar Addai's official jurisdiction at the time was Baghdad. Together, on February 20, 1972, Mar Narsai and Mar Toma consecrated Mar Addai Giwargis as Catholicos-Patriarch. In 1985, Mar Daniel Yakob, Bishop of Kirkuk of the Assyrian Church of the East was accepted into the Holy Synod of the Ancient Church of the East. He was to head the parishes in California, but ultimately served as an Auxiliary Bishop. In July 1992, Mar Yacoub Daniel was consecrated Bishop of Syria. The following year, in June 1993, Mar Emmanuel Elia was ordained Bishop of the Patriarchate of Baghdad. In 1994, however, Mar Emmanuel shifted his residence and became Bishop of North America and Canada. In November and December 1995, the Ancient Church experienced several major changes. Mar Aprem Mooken and Mar Poulose Poulose, along with the Church of India, reunited with the Assyrian Church of the East for external reasons. During that same period, Timothaus Mar Shallita (Mar Shallita) was accepted into the Holy Synod and appointed Metropolitan of Europe, and Mar Yacoub Daniel was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan. In July 2005, Mar Yacoub was transferred from Syria to Australia and New Zealand. In April 2009, Mar Addai II consecrated Mar Zaia Khoshaba as Bishop of Baghdad. In the same month, he ordained Mar Aprem Daweed as Bishop of Duhok. In 2011, Mar Aprem resigned after serving just two years. 2011 also saw the resignation of Mar Emmanuel. In August 2011, Mar Yacoub Daniel and Mar Zaia Khoshaba consecrated Mar Mari Emmanuel as Bishop for Australia and New Zealand, assisting the Metropolitan. Later Mar Addai II consecrated Mar Gewargis Younan as Bishop of Chicago, the youngest-serving prelate of the Ancient Church of the East. The Ancient Church of the East recognizes the following nine positions in its hierarchy: The Patriarch is the supreme head of the church, and oversees all dioceses of the church. The church has an episcopal polity, meaning it is organized into dioceses, each headed by a bishop. Dioceses are organized into Ecclesiastical provinces under the authority of a Metropolitan. Each diocese is made up of several parish communities. The individual parishes are staffed by at least one priest. Priests are assisted by Deacons, Subdeacons, and Readers. All members of the clergy may preach, baptize, witness marriages, and conduct funeral liturgies, though Deacons, Subdeacons, and Readers assume an assistant's role. Only those ranking above a deacon can celebrate the sacraments of the Eucharist, though others may be ministers of Holy Communion. Administering the sacrament of Holy Orders (ordaining someone into the clergy) is limited to Bishops, Metropolitans, and the Patriarch.  Since January 2011 the synod of the Ancient Church of the East has split between those accepting the Patriarchate of Mar Addai II and those Old Calendarists rejecting it. The anti-patriarchal party is headed by Timothaus Mar Shallita. Individual parishes in Sweden, Denmark, United States and Australia adhere to these prelates:  In 1964, during the reign of Shemon XXI Eshai (also known as Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII), a schism occurred in the Church of the East causing the establishment of a separate Ancient Church of the East with its center in Baghdad. The Ancient Church of the East acknowledges the traditional lineage of the Patriarchs of the Church of the East in Babylon from Mar Shimun Keepa until the schism of 1964. The Ancient Church considers itself a true continuation of this lineage, and recognizes the Assyrian Church of the East as the same. This schism occurred because of the changing of the church calendar from the traditional Julian calendar to the Gregorian one, along with hereditary succession and tribal rivalry. Directly following the split from the Assyrian Church of the East, the seat of the Patriarch remained vacant for three years before a Patriarch was elected. In 1968 communities in Iraq, Syria and India elected a rival Patriarch centered in Baghdad, the then suspended Metropolitan of India Mar Thoma Darmo. He consecrated prelates who in turn consecrated him Patriarch. Currently the Patriarchate is located in Baghdad, Iraq.  Various communities of Church of the East Old Calendarists seceded from the Ancient Church of the East in 2011 by continuing to observe the 25th of December on January 6th and 25th of March on April 6th, the Church of the East Calendar being 12 days behind the Gregorian calendar. The Ancient Church of the East was distinguished by its intent to maintain the traditions passed on by the Church of the East. The schism that divided the Church of the East into two parts resulted mainly from controversial changes introduced by Mar Shimun XXI Eshai. The most obvious of these was the decision to replace the traditional Julian Calendar with the Gregorian Calendar. Additionally, there were concerns raised in regard to the succession of the Patriarchate. The Patriarchate had been hereditary in the Mar Shimun family for six centuries, often resulting in the consecration of minors as head of the church. For example, the late Shimun XXI Eshai himself was ordained Patriarch at just twelve years old. Under the tenure of Mar Addai II, the Ancient Church of the East has made several gestures towards reunification with the Assyrian Church of the East. The most prominent of these is undoubtedly the declaration made in June 2010 stating that the Ancient Church of the East would now celebrate Christmas on December 25, in accordance with the Gregorian Calendar. Previously, the church recognized The Julian date (currently corresponding to January 7 on the Gregorian Calendar) each year as Christmas Day, as the Church of the East had for thousands of years. The decision was to be implemented later that year, on December 25, 2010. This was the first time since the schism that the two churches celebrated the Christmas holiday on the same day. Despite this decision, many Church of the East Old Calendarists rejected the move so in an attempt to avert further dissent, the Holy Synod maintained that Easter would continue to be celebrated according to the Julian Calendar. The declaration related to the celebration of Christmas was perceived as an attempt of reconciliation, and encouraged efforts for talks of reunification. A joint Holy Synod between the two churches was postponed, though is expected in the near future. The international Assyrian community has long-since advocated for reunification, particularly in response to the 2014 and 2015 attacks launched against Assyrians in Iraq and Syria, respectively. Since that time, relations between the churches have improved on every level, particularly in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe. In early May 2015, following the death of Mar Dinkha IV, Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, dialogue of unification resumed between the churches. Reunification of the two branches of the Church of the East was encouraged by the Patriarch. Following an informal meeting between Mar Gewargis Younan and Mar Paulus Benjamin, an official meeting request was delivered to Mar Aprem Mooken, acting Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. On May 22, 2015, a meeting involving prelates of both Holy Councils took place in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois in the library of St. Andrew's Assyrian Church of the East. Present were Mar Yacoub Daniel, Mar Zaia Khoshaba, and Mar Gewargis Younan representing the Ancient Church of the East, and Mar Gewargis Sliwa, Mar Awa Royel, and Mar Iskhaq Yousif representing the Assyrian Church of the East. Archdeacon William Toma served as the meeting's common secretary. Mar Yacoub Daniel flew in from Australia for the meeting, and Mar Zaia traveled from Canada. During the meeting, recommendations for unity between the Ancient Church of the East and Assyrian Church of the East were delivered through the selected representatives of each branch. The primary issues discussed were church leadership and the Holy Calendar. It was decided in this meeting that the individual Synods would meet separately to further discuss the terms. Another meeting between the two churches would then be scheduled to continue negotiations. It was requested by the Ancient Church of the East prelates that the election of the new Catholicos-Patriarch be delayed until negotiations had been concluded, in the hopes that a unified Synod would elect a successor together. In the event that the churches agree to reunify, Mar Addai II would be expected to resign. The Patriarch has already given his blessings, provided that the celebration of Easter Sunday in accordance with the traditional Julian Calendar is maintained. On June 1, 2015, the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East met in Erbil, Iraq to discuss the future of the church. The date had previously been arranged for the election of the new Catholicos-Patriarch. Mar Awa Royel issued a statement on the same day, notifying the public that a response to the Ancient Church of the East's recommendations for reunification had been delivered to their prelates. The letter requested a prompt response to the terms, and the election of the new Patriarch was suspended until the following week, on June 8, 2015. On June 2, 2015 Mar Gewargis Younan issued a statement on behalf of the Ancient Church of the East stating that a provisional decision had been reached to reunify the two branches. The statement dated June 2, 2015 also indicated that the Holy Synod of the Ancient Church plans to convene in the near future to issue a formal response. On June 5, 2015, Mar Aprem Mooken issued a formal statement announcing that the election of the next Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East was suspended until September 27, 2015, pending the unification of the churches.", "The Decline of Eastern Christianity\nThe Decline of Eastern Christianity The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude is a book by author Bat Ye'or. In the book the author describes her interpretation of the waning of the Eastern Christendom under the Islamic empire's conquests. Bat Yeor described her book as \"\"In this study, I tried to analyze the numerous processes that had transformed rich, powerful Christian civilizations into Islamic lands and their long-term effects, which had reduced native Christian majorities into scattered small religious minorities, now slowly disappearing. This complex Islamization process of Christian lands and civilizations on both shores of the Mediterranean—and in Iraq and Armenia—I have called: the process of \"dhimmitude\" and the civilization of those peoples who underwent such transformation, I have named the civilization of \"dhimmitude\"\". The book consists of two parts, an analysis, which aims to paint a broad picture of the conversion of the Near East to Islam, and an appendix containing selected primary sources. The emphasis of the analysis lies on the near past, especially the 19th century. The appendix contains translations of Islamic and non-Islamic sources from the Middle Ages and Western sources of newer date. Professor of Middle East studies at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mordechai Nisan writes that Bat Ye'or's \"exceptionally relevant scholarly study ... amasses compelling evidence and employs powerful argumentation to expose and explain dhimmitude—the author's neologism.\" She challenges traditional notions of Islamic tolerance and the future of minorities within Islamic lands. German orientalist Holger Preissler, in a review positive to the ambition and subject of the book, writes that the book curiously does not cite readily available high quality sources, and that Ye'Or overplays the role of jihad in modern times. He also points out that in criticising frequent one-sided and apologetic uses of Islamic sources, Ye'Or fails to avoid going to the opposite extreme, particularly in the documentation part of the book. Sidney H. Griffith writes that Bat Yeor raised important inter-religious problem but the book itself is problematic as Griffith points out : \"They [the documents used as sources] are presented out of context with no analysis or explanation... The trouble with \"The Decline of Eastern Christianity\" is that in spite of the gathering of an enormous amount of historical material, and although she has raised an issue that well deserves study, Bat Ye'or has written a polemical tract, not responsible historical analysis.Meanwhile, the historical question remains to be answered: why is it that from the mid-7th century to the 20th century the number of Christians in the Islamic world has dwindled from a majority in many areas of the Middle East to virtual insignificance in terms of demography? Is it really due to the net effects of the disabilities prescribed by Islamic law for the dhimmil Or are there other factors?\" In a review of \"The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude\" the American historian Robert Brenton Betts commented that the book dealt with Judaism at least as much as with Christianity, that the title was misleading and the central premise flawed. He said: \"The general tone of the book is strident and anti-Muslim. This is coupled with selective scholarship designed to pick out the worst examples of anti-Christian behavior by Muslim governments, usually in time of war and threats to their own destruction (as in the case of the Turk-perpetrated Armenian genocide of 1915). Add to this the attempt to demonize the so-called Islamic threat to Western civilization and the end-product is generally unedifying and frequently irritating.\" The Catholic convert and minister Richard John Neuhaus wrote that the book \"tells the story straight, thus countering the Islamophile histories that have dominated Western thought for so long\"."], "neg": ["Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan\nMoran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) is the founder and Metropolitan Bishop of Believers Eastern Church (Earlier Believers Church) one of the Episcopal denominations in India, he is also the founder and president of Gospel for Asia, a large Episcopal NGO with a focus on India and Asia. He is the pioneer in establishing one of the largest child care projects in India called Bridge of Hope. Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan claims to have authored over 200 books on Christian living and missions, though there is some controversy around his authorship.  Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) was born in 1950 and raised in a St. Thomas Syrian Christian (Mar Thoma Syrian Church) family in Kerala, India. At age 8 he became a follower of Jesus. He was 16 when he joined Operation Mobilization, an evangelical missions movement, and served with them for eight years on the Indian subcontinent. Through an invitation from Dr. W. A. Criswell, Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) moved to the United States in 1974 for theological studies at Criswell College (at the time \"Criswell Bible Institute\") in Dallas, Texas. He graduated with a B.A. in Biblical Studies, becoming the school’s first international student to graduate. He eventually was also conferred an honorary degree of divinity by Hindustan Bible Institute & College in Chennai, India. Though his degree is honorary, he often uses the title of \"doctor\" when in the United States. Six months into his undergraduate degree, Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) became an ordained clergyman and served as a pastor of a Native American Southern Baptist church for four years near Dallas, Texas. In 1978, Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan and his wife Gisela started an organization known today as Gospel for Asia, which is resided in Carrollton, Texas until 2014 in which it moved to Wills Point, Texas. In the first year, they helped provide financial support and training to 24 missionaries.. In 1979, he resigned from his church to devote his attention full-time to mission work. In 1981, he started a chapter of Gospel for Asia in Kerala and in 1983 created an Indian headquarter in Tiruvalla. GFA claims to directly support more than 50 Bible colleges in various countries. Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) is married to Gisela, who served with him in Operation Mobilization. They met in 1973. In 1974, they were married in Germany, Gisela’s country of birth. They have two children, Daniel and Sarah. In 2018, K.P. Yohannan announced that he would know be known as Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan. Believers Eastern Church (previously Believers Church) is a Episcopal denomination which claims to have congregations and parishes worldwide. The church has an episcopal governance. Believers Eastern Church is an \"Ancient-Future Church\" and as such, is considered by some to be heretical. The church holds Christ as the head of the Church (Col 1:18); hence it is governed by a committee of Bishops, the Synod, with one central Bishop holding the honorary title of \"first among equals\" and follows Episcopal doctrine. Believers Eastern Church is administratively based in the state of Kerala in southwestern India. In 2015, the church reported it was re-organized into 33 dioceses; a decrease from the 36 dioceses reported by Smith in 2009. According to Believers Eastern Church, its membership consists of more than 3.5 million people in 10 countries speaking a hundred languages. The Church currently has 30 Bishops, and the current Metropolitan Bishop is Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan). Bishops and ordained clergy are required to vow allegiance and submission to the metropolitan (currently Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan) and all of his successors.  Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) is the author of eight books published in the US and has authored more than 200 books published in India. His book \"Revolution In World Missions\", has over 2 million copies in print. Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan's (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) radio broadcast, \"Road to Reality,\" is heard on over 900 radio stations throughout the USA, Canada, U.K., and Australia. He has also been heard on the Athmeeya Yathra (Spiritual Journey) daily broadcast for the past 25 years. This is broadcast in 14 nations in 113 Asian languages. Athmeeya Yathra now includes a television station and print media. Gospel for Asia claims to be one of the largest missionary organizations in the world, but is constantly marred by dubious fund distribution and a current RICO lawsuit in federal court, set for trial in 2019. Gospel for Asia adheres to Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan's belief in the efficiency and efficacy of “national missionaries”, or missionaries that are native to the nation or culture being served. The organization’s primary mission fields are those people that live in the “10/40 Window”, referring to longitudinal coordinates consisting of areas in west Africa, India and east Asia.  Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) credits his early work in his native India as inspiration for his focus on the poor and underserved in this region. He states: “In my head I knew all the answers, and Bible became the tool of the trade for me that I would use to teach and preach and I was doing very well. People liked my sermons, but finally I said to myself, ‘I’m not the same person I was when the Lord called me to serve Him. I’m not the same person that I was that walked on the streets of North India weeping over the lost and perishing millions and stayed up all night praying and weeping over a world map. The Lord was gracious enough to talk to us very lovingly, and I realized that he wanted me to go back to America and speak to the ‘Body of Christ’ about the possibility of seeing countries like India, Burma and Bhutan, turn to Christ if only they would become unselfish in praying and helping these brothers by becoming senders.” From its inception, Gospel for Asia has held to Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan's conviction of the use of national missionaries. The ministry discourages direct missions from outside countries or people-groups, but rather trains and equips missionaries from within distinct cultures. In order to accomplish this, Gospel for Asia claims to have over 56 Bible schools in 10 countries, training over 9000 ministers. In all, Gospel for Asia claims to have trained over 16,000 national missionaries. In addition to training national missionaries, Gospel for Asia incorporates several other ministries such as Bridge of Hope (child sponsorship), Jesus Wells (clean water wells), bible translation, radio and television broadcasts, disaster relief and refugee camp aid. The operations of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church were scrutinized after Believers Church, under the guidance of Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan), purchased a rubber estate in Kerala, India. Opponents claimed the church had diverted foreign funds to amass land for itself and for uses other than declared purposes. Further, it was alleged that the rubber estate, which Believers Church purchased from Harrison's Malayalam Ltd., was on leasehold from the government and not saleable. Hence, Believers Church was accused of illegally holding government land. At a later time, Harrison's Malayalam was accused of forging their land title, leading to continued debate about the legality of the sale. Legal proceedings are still ongoing. “Former Ernakulam District Collector Dr M G Rajamanickam, who was appointed as the Special Officer of the government to confiscate the illegal and excess estate lands under the custody of various companies, had issued an order in May, 2015, confiscating the 2,268 acre of land from Believers’ Church.\" However, this ruling was appealed and now there is further complication because the local government wants to build an airport on this estate. News outlets are reporting that the local government wants to buy the property. However, it is also reported that \"The government does not need permission from K P Yohannan to set up airport in the Cheruvally estate, BJP national executive member V Muraleedharan said.\" The BJP is currently behind a large scale anti-corruption crackdown on Black Money inside India. Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) says that the claims were politically motivated and that the workings of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church are transparent. Further, the rubber estate is an investment to help fund social services among underdeveloped communities and not a personal land grab as opponents have claimed. The controversies regarding the purchase of estate have been cleared by the Kerala High Court. The findings pointed out by Dr. M G Rajamanickam in his report have been completely rejected by the court. The court came down heavily on the government and the officer for playing \"robin hood\" with the owners of the estate. A long standing controversy for Believers Church comes to an end with a clean verdict from the high court of Kerala. There are currently two RICO anti-fraud lawsuits active against Gospel for Asia, naming Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) as one of the defendants among other Gospel for Asia leaders. One of the lawsuits has a scheduled jury trial on 4/15/2019. Gospel for Asia continues to deny any wrongdoing."]}

Gradually other railways were acquired, including in 1865 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, whose works at Cowlairs, Glasgow were better than that at St. Margarets, which were reduced to repairs only and all production moved to Cowlairs. As is customary, engine classes are organized according to the man who was locomotive superintendent when the class was introduced, and to whom the design is often attributed. The NBR was rather unfortunate in its choice of locomotive superintendents, the first five of whom were sacked or forced to resign either for alleged incompetence or financial scandals. The NBR's locomotive classification system (introduced in 1913) is not very helpful because the same letter has been applied to several different classes. The North British Railway Study Group has developed its own classification system and a list can be found here .

Chalmers held the same position, but with the title changed to \"Chief Mechanical Engineer\". There were no new locomotive designs during the incumbency of Walter Chalmers as Chief Mechanical Engineer. Two new NBR H class locomotives were built under his supervision. Although these were not his design, he had drawn the designs under the direction of W P Reid, having been Chief Draughtsman (the deputy to the Locomotive Superintendent) of the NBR whilst Reid was Locomotive Superintendent.

Worsdell was an enthusiast for compounding and many of his designs used the two-cylinder system of August von Borries, usually in conjunction with simple-expansion versions of the same engines for comparison. The compounds were mostly rebuilt as simple-expansion engines by his brother and successor Wilson Worsdell. He introduced the system of class designations, starting with \"A\" for the first, and so on, and then adding a digit for later developments of each. This system was reorganized somewhat in 1914.

{"query": "Parasite social status outside feasts instead of legal rights at feasts in Roman law", "pos": ["Roman festivals\nRoman festivals Festivals in ancient Rome were a very important part of Roman religious life during both the Republican and Imperial eras, and one of the primary features of the Roman calendar. Feriae (\"holidays\" in the sense of \"holy days\"; singular also \"feriae\" or dies ferialis) were either public \"(publicae)\" or private \"(privatae)\". State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. Games \"(ludi)\", such as the Ludi Apollinares, were not technically \"feriae\", but the days on which they were celebrated were \"dies festi\", holidays in the modern sense of days off work. Although \"feriae\" were paid for by the state, \"ludi\" were often funded by wealthy individuals. \"Feriae privatae\" were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families. This article deals only with public holidays, including rites celebrated by the state priests of Rome at temples, as well as celebrations by neighborhoods, families, and friends held simultaneously throughout Rome \"Feriae\" were of four kinds: One of the most important sources for Roman holidays is Ovid's \"Fasti\", an incomplete poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of Augustus. Varro defined \"feriae\" as \"days instituted for the sake of the gods.\" Religious rites were performed on the \"feriae\", and public business was suspended. Even slaves were supposed to be given some form of rest. Cicero says specifically that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labors. Agricultural writers recognized that some jobs on a farm might still need to be performed, and specified what these were. Some agricultural tasks not otherwise permitted could be carried out if an expiation were made in advance \"(piaculum)\", usually the sacrifice of a puppy. Within the city of Rome, the flamens and the priest known as the \"Rex sacrorum\" were not allowed even to see work done. On a practical level, those who \"inadvertently\" worked could pay a fine or offer up a \"piaculum\", usually a pig. Work considered vital either to the gods or preserving human life was excusable, according to some experts on religious law. Although Romans were required not to work, they were not required to take any religious action unless they were priests or had family rites \"(sacra gentilicia)\" to maintain. Following is a month-by-month list of Roman festivals and games that had a fixed place on the calendar. For some, the date on which they were first established is recorded. A deity's festival often marked the anniversary (\"dies natalis,\" \"birthday\") of the founding of a temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Festivals not named for deities are thought to be among the oldest on the calendar. Some religious observances were monthly. The first day of the month was the Kalends (or Calends, from which the English word \"calendar\" derives). Each Kalends was sacred to Juno, and the \"Regina sacrorum\" (\"Queen of the Rites,\" a public priestess) marked the day by presiding over a sacrifice to the goddess. Originally a pontiff and the \"Rex sacrorum\" reported the sighting of the new moon, and the pontiff announced whether the Nones occurred on the 5th or 7th of that month. On the Nones, announcements were made regarding events to take place that month; with the exception of the Poplifugia, no major festivals were held before the Nones, though other ceremonies, such as anniversaries of temple dedications, might be carried out. The Ides (usually the 13th, or in a few months the 15th) were sacred to Jupiter. On each Ides, a white lamb was led along the Via Sacra to the Capitolium for sacrifice to Jupiter. The list also includes other notable public religious events such as sacrifices and processions that were observed annually but are neither \"feriae\" nor \"dies natales.\" Unless otherwise noted, the calendar is that of H.H. Scullard, \"Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic\".  In the archaic Roman calendar, February was the last month of the year. The name derives from \"februa\", \"the means of purification, expiatory offerings.\" It marked a turn of season, with February 5 the official first day of spring bringing the renewal of agricultural activities after winter. In the old Roman calendar (until perhaps as late as 153 BC), the \"mensis Martius\" (\"Mars' Month\") was the first month of the year. It is one of the few months to be named for a god, Mars, whose festivals dominate the month. A major \"feriae conceptivae\" in April was the Latin Festival. The \"feriae conceptivae\" of this month was the Ambarvalia. Scullard places the Taurian Games on June 25–26, but other scholars doubt these \"ludi\" had a fixed date or recurred on a regular basis. Until renamed for Julius Caesar, this month was called Quinctilis or Quintilis, originally the fifth month \"(quint-)\" when the year began in March. From this point in the calendar forward, the months had numerical designations. Until renamed for Augustus Caesar, this month was called Sextilis, originally the sixth month (sext-) when the year began in March.   The following \"moveable feasts\" are listed roughly in chronological order. The Rosalia or \"Festival of Roses\" also had no fixed date, but was technically not one of the \"feriae conceptivae\" with a date announced by public priests based on archaic practice. Festivals were also held in ancient Rome in response to particular events, or for a particular purpose such as to propitiate or show gratitude toward the gods. For example, Livy reports that following the Roman destruction of Alba Longa in the 7th century BC, and the removal of the Alban populace to Rome, it was reported to have rained stones on the Mons Albanus. A Roman deputation was sent to investigate the report, and a further shower of stones was witnessed. The Romans took this to be a sign of the displeasure of the Alban gods, the worship of whom had been abandoned with the evacuation of Alba Longa. Livy goes on to say that the Romans instituted a public festival of nine days, at the instigation either of a 'heavenly voice' heard on the Mons Albanus, or of the haruspices. Livy also says that it became the longstanding practice in Rome that whenever a shower of stones was reported, a festival of nine days would be ordered in response. Another irregular festival of note is the Secular Games. Over the course of several days there were sacrifices, entertainers, and games hosted by the state, attempting to be the greatest display anyone living had ever seen. These games were intended to be held every 100 years with the purpose of it occurring only once in any individuals lifetime. At one point two cycles of the Secular Games were being held simultaneously, leading there to be people who would in fact witness it twice in their life. The noun \"mercatus\" (plural \"mercatūs\") means \"commerce\" or \"the market\" generally, but it also refers to fairs or markets held immediately after certain \"ludi\". Cicero said that Numa Pompilius, the semi-legendary second king of Rome, established \"mercatus\" in conjunction with religious festivals to facilitate trade, since people had already gathered in great numbers. In early times, these \"mercatus\" may have played a role in wholesale trade, but as commerce in Rome became more sophisticated, by the late Republic they seem to have become retail fairs specialized for the holiday market. The Sigillaria attached to the Saturnalia may have been a \"mercatus\" in this sense. Surviving \"fasti\" record Mercatus Apollinares, July 14–19; Mercatus Romani, September 20–23; and Mercatus Plebeii, November 18–20. Others may have existed. The English word \"fair\" derives from Latin \"feria\". By the outset of the nineteenth century and particularly in response to the carnage of the latter years of the French revolution, the term Roman holiday had taken on sinister aspects, implying an event that occasions enjoyment or profit at the expense, or derived from the suffering, of others, as in this passage from \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" (1812–18) by George Gordon, Lord Byron: There were his young barbarians all at play,<br>There was their Dacian mother—he their sire,<br>Butchered to make a Roman holiday.\" More benignly, the phrase was used as the title of a romantic movie set in Rome, \"Roman Holiday.\"", "Parasitism (social offense)\nParasitism (social offense) Social parasitism is a pejorative that is leveled against a group or class which is considered to be detrimental to society. The term comes from the ancient Greek (\"parásitos\"), \"one who lives at another's expense, person who eats at the table of another,\" used to label the social offender. For example, the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky was charged with social parasitism by the Soviet authorities in a trial in 1964, who found that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society. Depending on point of view, a social parasite may be one of several classes: Socialists have described members of the upper classes as economic parasites. The Russian lyrics of the socialist anthem \"The Internationale\" include a reference to parasites. The German Nazis viewed \"races without homeland\" as \"parasitic races\" or \"Untermensch\" to be eliminated. These included Romani people (sometimes called Gypsies) and Jews. The habitually \"work-shy\" (\"arbeitsscheu\") were imprisoned in concentration camps (see Black triangle (badge)). According to at least one commentator, it may be the new social paradigm—involving class warfare and exploitation of electoral processes—of myriad and disparate countries around the world. See Oligarchy, Kleptocracy and Elite capture. In the Soviet Union, which declared itself a workers' state, every adult able-bodied person was expected to work until official retirement. Thus unemployment was officially and theoretically eliminated. Those who refused to work, study or serve in another way risked being criminally charged with \"social parasitism\" ( \"tuneyadstvo\", тунеядцы [\"tuneyadets/tuneyadetchi\"\"), in accordance with the socialist principle \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution.\" In 1961, 130,000 people were identified as leading the \"anti-social, parasitic way of life\" in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Charges of parasitism were frequently applied to dissidents and refuseniks, many of whom were intellectuals. Since their writings were considered against the regime, the state prevented them from obtaining employment. To avoid trials for parasitism, many of them took unskilled (but not especially time-consuming) jobs (street sweepers, firekeepers, etc.), which allowed them to continue their other pursuits. Policies introduced in 2015, which observers noted as being reminiscent of Soviet-era initiatives, included a tax for those who were considered \"social parasites\". Defined as people working under 183 days in a year, and excluding home-makers and subsistence farmers, the deployment of the so-called parasite tax has been suspended after protests in several major urban centers.", "Status in Roman legal system\nStatus in Roman legal system In Roman law, status describes a person's legal status. The individual could be a Roman citizen (\"status civitatis\"), unlike foreigners; or he could be free (\"status libertatis\"), unlike slaves; or he could have a certain position in a Roman family (\"status familiae\") either as head of the family (\"pater familias\"), or as a lower member (\"filii familias\"). In the Roman state, according to Roman civil law (\"ius civile\"), only Roman citizens had the full civil and political rights. In regard to \"status civitatis\", in the Roman state, there were \"cives\", \"Latini\" and \"peregrini\", and foreigners. Outside the Roman state, there were \"externi\", \"barbari\" and \"hostes\". \"Status familiae\" is the legal status of an individual in the family. The pater familias had the authority in the family (patria potestas), and everyone was subjected to him based on adgnatio (kinship only from father's side). This had an impact in private law. There is a distinction between alieni iuris (persons under patria potestas) and sui iuris (persons autonomous of patria potestas, who could only be the pater familias himself). Filius familias had ius suffragii and ius honorum, but in the area of private law he was restricted because of patria potestas. The social and legal status of slaves in the Roman state was different in different epochs. In the time of old civil law (ius civile Quiritium) slavery had a patriarchal shape (a slave did the same job and lived under the same conditions as his master and family). After Rome's victorious wars, from the 3rd century BC, huge numbers of slaves came to Rome, and that resulted in slave trade and increased exploitation of slaves. From that time on, a slave became only a thing (res)- \"servi pro nullis habentur\". The legal state of slaves was based on the fact that the slave was not a subject but an object of law. A master had the right of ownership over the slave. He could sell him, give him in pawn but certainly could not harm or kill him. If someone injured his slave, a master could initiate legal proceedings and demand protection. The ownership over the slave was called \"dominica potestas\", and not \"dominium\" like the ownership of objects and animals. In the Roman legal system, a slave did not have a family. His sexual relationships with other slaves was not marriage (\"matrimonium\"), but a cohabitation (\"contubernium\"), without legal consequences. Masters could also give over a certain amount of property (such as land, buildings), known as \"peculium\", to a slave for his management and use. This peculium was protected under Roman law and inaccessible by the owner. This was another tool slaves could use to purchase their freedom. The oldest means of becoming a slave was to be captured as an enemy in war. However, even a foreigner could become free again and even a Roman citizen could become a slave. Slavery was hereditary, and the child of a slave woman became a slave no matter who the father was. However, according to classical law, a child of a slave became free (\"ingenuus\"), if his or her mother was free, even for a short period of time, during the pregnancy. There were a number of means by which a free man could become a slave in Roman society.  After the Punic wars, Rome started the mass exploitation of slaves. However, the development of industry, trade and other branches of economy required skilled free workers that took interest in their jobs. A slave could get free by the act of manumission, by which a master would release him from his authority. Manumissions were different in different epochs. The old civil law (ius civile Quiritium) recognized three kinds of manumissions:  At the beginning of the empire, because of the number of manumissions, legal limitations of manumissions were made. These limitations were implemented by two laws: Lex Fufia Caninia and Lex Aelia Sentia. According to Roman law, slaves that were freed (\"libertinus\", in regard to his master \"libertus\") became Roman citizens, but they had many fewer rights than Roman citizens that were born free (\"ingenuus\"). The slave's former master now became his patron (\"patronus\"), and the \"libertus\" still had obligations towards him (this was regulated by law). The \"libertus\" had to be obedient and respectful to his patron (\"obsequium et reverentia\"). The patron could punish a disobedient \"libertus\", In older times he could even kill him (\"ius vitae necisque\"), but later he could not. In some circumstances he could even ask a magistrate to turn the \"libertus\" into a slave once again (\"accusatio ingrati\")."], "neg": ["Infamia\nInfamia In ancient Roman culture, infamia (\"in-\", \"not,\" and \"fama\", \"reputation\") was a loss of legal or social standing. As a technical term of Roman law, \"infamia\" was an official exclusion from the legal protections enjoyed by a Roman citizen, as imposed by a censor or praetor. More generally, especially during the Republic and Principate, \"infamia\" was informal damage to one's esteem or reputation. A person who suffered \"infamia\" was an infamis (plural infames). \"Infamia\" was an \"inescapable consequence\" for certain professionals, including prostitutes and pimps, entertainers such as actors and dancers, and gladiators. \"Infames\" could not, for instance, provide testimony in a court of law. They were liable to corporal punishment, which was usually reserved for slaves. The \"infamia\" of entertainers did not exclude them from socializing among the Roman elite, and entertainers who were \"stars\", both men and women, sometimes became the lovers of such high-profile figures as the \"dictator\" Sulla and Mark Antony. A passive homosexual who was \"outed\" might also be subject to social \"infamia\", though if he was a citizen he might retain his legal standing. The modern Roman Catholic Church has a similar concept of infamy."]}
{"query": "Three O’Clock Blues influence on blues music instead of its recording details with Tuff Green", "pos": ["3 O'Clock Blues\n3 O'Clock Blues \"3 O'Clock Blues\" or \"Three O'Clock Blues\" is a slow twelve-bar blues recorded by Lowell Fulson in 1946. When it was released in 1948, it became Fulson's first hit. When B.B. King recorded the song in 1952, it became his first hit as well as one of the best-selling R&B singles in 1952. \"3 O'Clock Blues\" effectively launched King's career and remained a part of his concert repertoire throughout his life. The song was included on his first album, \"Singin' the Blues\" and since has appeared on several King albums, including a remake in 2000 with Eric Clapton for the \"Riding with the King\" album. Lowell Fulson recorded \"Three O'Clock Blues\" during his first recording session for Oakland, California-based record producer Bob Geddins in 1946. Fulson, who sang and played guitar, was accompanied by his brother Martin on second guitar. The duo produced several country blues-style songs after World War II. According to music historian Ted Gioia, the song lyrics start out \"as an insomniac's lament, but end up with a weepy farewell more suited to a suicide note\": By the time of the record's release two years later in 1948, Fulson's style had already evolved into a West Coast blues style typified by his hit recordings for Downbeat and Swing Time Records, such as \"Every Day I Have the Blues\" and \"Blue Shadows\". Nonetheless, \"Three O'Clock Blues\", became a hit and reached number six in the R&B chart. B.B. King recorded \"3 O'Clock Blues\" for RPM Records around September 1951. The recording took place at an improvised studio in a room at the Memphis YMCA and the resulting audio quality was lower than recordings by Sam Phillips, who had recorded King's previous singles. Nonetheless, writer Colin Escott notes that the song \"clicked where the others hadn't [perhaps due to] the new found drama and urgency in B.B.'s singing [and] the interplay between his voice and guitar, heard for the first time on record\". The mingling of these two elements was brought to the forefront by the distant, subdued sound of the accompanying musicians. King's version is a slow (65 beats per minute)twelve-bar blues notated in 12/8 time in the key of C. Blues historian Robert Palmer sees King's guitar work on the song as showing his T-Bone Walker influences, \"though his tone was bigger and rounder and his phrasing somewhat heavier\". He borrowed Walker's technique of repeating a pitch on neighboring strings by sounding a note then sliding up to the same pitch on the successive lower string. This method allows the player to shift to higher position while creating a unique effect that emphasizes \"tonal contrast\". King also used melisma, a vocal technique found in gospel music, in which he bends and stretches a single syllable into a melodic phrase. Unlike Fulson, King used a full backing arrangement, including a horn section (including Evelyn Young on saxophone) and Ike Turner on piano. \"3 O'Clock Blues\" was released by RPM Records in 1951 and by December 29 entered \"Billboard\" magazine's Rhythm and Blues charts. It spent a total of 17 weeks on the charts, including five weeks at number one. In 1956, the song was included on B.B. King's first compilation album, \"Singin' the Blues\". \"3 O'Clock Blues\" launched B.B. King's career and gave him his first opportunity to perform in front of national audience. Due to the song's success, he began performing in the big theaters, such as the Howard Theater in Washington and the Apollo in New York, with a significant increase in his weekly earnings, from about $85 to $2,500. It sparked a touring schedule that continued throughout King's career. In 1956, the song was included on King's first album, \"Singin' the Blues\". It has remained in King's repertoire and he has recorded several versions of the song, including a 2000 release with Eric Clapton for their \"Riding with the King\" album."], "neg": ["Blue in Green\nBlue in Green \"Blue in Green\" is the third tune on Miles Davis' 1959 album, \"Kind of Blue\". One of two ballads on the LP (the other being \"Flamenco Sketches\"), the melody of \"Blue in Green\" is very modal, incorporating the presence of the Dorian, Mixolydian, and Lydian modes. This is the only song that Cannonball Adderley sits out. It has long been speculated that pianist Bill Evans wrote \"Blue in Green\", even though the LP and most jazz fakebooks credit only Davis with its composition. In his autobiography, Davis maintains that he alone composed the songs on \"Kind of Blue.\" The version on Evans' trio album \"Portrait in Jazz\", recorded in 1959, credits the tune to \"Davis-Evans\". Earl Zindars, in an interview conducted by Win Hinkle, said that \"Blue in Green\" was 100% written by Bill Evans. In a radio interview broadcast on May 27, 1979, Evans himself said that he had written the song. On being asked about the issue by interviewer Marian McPartland, he said: \"The truth is I did [write the music]... I don't want to make a federal case out of it, the music exists, and Miles is getting the royalties...\" Evans recounted that when he suggested that he was entitled to a share of the royalties, Davis wrote him a check for $25. In a recording made in December 1958 or January 1959 for Chet Baker's album \"Chet\" (prior to the \"Kind of Blue\" sessions), Evans' introduction on the jazz standard \"Alone Together\" has been directly compared to his playing on \"Blue in Green\"."]}
{"query": "MV \\\"Muirfield\\\" ship history and routes instead of seamount discovery accident", "pos": ["Nautical chart\nNautical chart A nautical chart is a graphic representation of a maritime area and adjacent coastal regions. Depending on the scale of the chart, it may show depths of water and heights of land (topographic map), natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and human-made aids to navigation, information on tides and currents, local details of the Earth's magnetic field, and human-made structures such as harbours, buildings and bridges. Nautical charts are essential tools for marine navigation; many countries require vessels, especially commercial ships, to carry them. Nautical charting may take the form of charts printed on paper or computerized electronic navigational charts. Recent technologies have made available paper charts which are printed \"on demand\" with cartographic data that has been downloaded to the commercial printing company as recently as the night before printing. With each daily download, critical data such as Local Notice to Mariners is added to the on-demand chart files so that these charts will be up to date at the time of printing. Nautical charts are based on hydrographic surveys. As surveying is laborious and time-consuming, hydrographic data for many areas of sea may be dated and not always reliable. Depths are measured in a variety of ways. Historically the sounding line was used. In modern times, echo sounding is used for measuring the seabed in the open sea. When measuring the safe depth of water over an entire obstruction, such as a shipwreck, the minimum depth is checked by sweeping the area with a length of horizontal wire. This ensures that difficult to find projections, such as masts, do not present a danger to vessels navigating over the obstruction. Nautical charts are issued by power of the national hydrographic offices in many countries. These charts are considered \"official\" in contrast to those made by commercial publishers. Many hydrographic offices provide regular, sometimes weekly, manual updates of their charts through their sales agents. Individual hydrographic offices produce national chart series and international chart series. Coordinated by the International Hydrographic Organization, the international chart series is a worldwide system of charts (\"INT\" chart series), which is being developed with the goal of unifying as many chart systems as possible. There are also commercially published charts, some of which may carry additional information of particular interest, e.g. for yacht skippers. The nature of a waterway depicted by a chart may change, and artificial aids to navigation may be altered at short notice. Therefore, old or uncorrected charts should never be used for navigation. Every producer of nautical charts also provides a system to inform mariners of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, chart corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. In the U.S., NOAA also has a printing partner who prints the \"POD\" (print on demand) NOAA charts, and they contain the very latest corrections and notifications at the time of printing. To give notice to mariners, radio broadcasts provide advance notice of urgent corrections. A good way to keep track of corrections is with a \"Chart and Publication Correction Record Card\" system. Using this system, the navigator does not immediately update every chart in the portfolio when a new \"Notice to Mariners\" arrives, instead creating a card for every chart and noting the correction on this card. When the time comes to use the chart, he pulls the chart and chart's card, and makes the indicated corrections on the chart. This system ensures that every chart is properly corrected prior to use. A prudent mariner should obtain a new chart if he has not kept track of corrections and his chart is more than several months old. Various Digital Notices to Mariners systems are available on the market such as Digitrace, Voyager, or ChartCo, to correct British Admiralty charts as well as NOAA charts. These systems provide only vessel relevant corrections via e-mail or web downloads, reducing the time needed to sort out corrections for each chart. Tracings to assist corrections are provided at the same time. The Canadian Coast Guard produces the Notice to Mariners publication which informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters. This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site. The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications. Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic navigational charts. In 1973 the cargo ship \"MV Muirfield\" (a merchant vessel named after Muirfield, Scotland) struck an unknown object in waters charted at a depth of greater than 5,000 metres (16,404 ft), resulting in extensive damage to her keel. In 1983, HMAS \"Moresby\", a Royal Australian Navy survey ship, surveyed the area where \"Muirfield\" was damaged, and charted in detail a previously unsuspected hazard to navigation, the Muirfield Seamount. The dramatic accidental discovery of the Muirfield Seamount is often cited as an example of limitations in the vertical geodetic datum accuracy of some offshore areas as represented on nautical charts, especially on small-scale charts.  A similar incident involving a passenger ship occurred in 1992 when the Cunard liner \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" struck a submerged rock off Block Island in the Atlantic Ocean. In November 1999, the semi-submersible, heavy-lift ship \"Mighty Servant 2\" capsized and sank after hitting an uncharted single underwater isolated pinnacle of granite off Indonesia. Five crew members died and \"Mighty Servant 2\" was declared a total loss. More recently, in 2005 the submarine USS \"San Francisco\" ran into an uncharted sea mount (sea mountain) about 560 kilometres (350 statute miles) south of Guam at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman. In September 2006 the jack-up barge \"Octopus\" ran aground on an uncharted sea mount within the Orkney Islands (United Kingdom) while being towed by the tug \"Harold\". £1M worth of damage was caused to the barge and delayed work on the installation of a tidal energy generator prototype. As stated in the Mariners Handbook and subsequent accident report: \"No chart is infallible. Every chart is liable to be incomplete\". The Mercator projection is used on the vast majority of nautical charts. Since the Mercator projection is conformal, that is, bearings in the chart are identical to the corresponding angles in nature, courses plotted on the chart may be used directly as the course-to-steer at the helm. The gnomonic projection is used for charts intended for plotting of great circle routes. NOAA uses the polyconic projection for some of its charts of the Great Lakes, at both large and small scales. Positions of places shown on the chart can be measured from the longitude and latitude scales on the borders of the chart, relative to a geodetic datum such as WGS 84. A bearing is the angle between the line joining the two points of interest and the line from one of the points to the north, such as a ship's course or a compass reading to a landmark. On nautical charts, the top of the chart is always true north, rather than magnetic north, towards which a compass points. Most charts include a compass rose depicting the variation between magnetic and true north. However, the use of the Mercator projection is not without its drawbacks. Mercator's technique was to make the lines of longitude parallel. On the real globe, the lines of longitude converge as one goes north or south away from the equator, until they meet at the pole. This distortion means that horizontal distances are exaggerated. Mercator's solution, imperfect as it might be, was to increase the distance between lines of latitude in proportion; in a Mercator's projection map, a square is a square no matter where you are on the chart, but a square on the Arctic Circle is much bigger than a square at the equator, even though both occupy the same number of degrees on the globe. The result of this is that scale in a nautical chart is dependent on latitude. In practical use, this is less of a problem than it sounds. One minute of latitude is, for practical purposes, a nautical mile. Distances in nautical miles can therefore be measured on the latitude gradations printed on the side of the chart. Conventional nautical charts are printed on large sheets of paper at a variety of scales. Mariners will generally carry many charts to provide sufficient detail for the areas they might need to visit. Electronic navigational charts, which use computer software and electronic databases to provide navigation information, can augment or in some cases replace paper charts, though many mariners carry paper charts as a backup in case the electronic charting system fails. Nautical charts must be labeled with navigational and depth information. There are a few commercial software packages that do automatic label placement for any kind of map or chart. Many countries' hydrographic agencies publish a \"Chart 1\", which explains all of the symbols, terms and abbreviations used on charts that they produce for both domestic and international use. Each country starts with the base symbology specified in IHO standard INT 1, and is then permitted to add its own supplemental symbologies to its domestic charts, which are also explained in its version of Chart 1. Ships are typically required to carry copies of Chart 1 with their paper charts. The chart uses symbols to provide pilotage information about the nature and position of features useful to navigators, such as sea bed information, sea mark, and landmarks. Some symbols describe the sea bed with information such as its depth, materials as well as possible hazards such as shipwrecks. Other symbols show the position and characteristics of buoys, lights, lighthouses, coastal and land features and structures that are useful for position fixing. The abbreviation \"ED\" is commonly used to label geographic locations whose existence is doubtful. Colours distinguish between man-made features, dry land, sea bed that dries with the tide, and seabed that is permanently underwater and indicate water depth. Depths which have been measured are indicated by the numbers shown on the chart. Depths on charts published in most parts of the world use metres. Older charts, as well as those published by the United States government, may use feet or fathoms. Depth contour lines show the shape of underwater relief. Coloured areas of the sea emphasise shallow water and dangerous underwater obstructions. Depths are measured from the chart datum, which is related to the local sea level. The chart datum varies according to the standard used by each national Hydrographic Office. In general, the move is towards using lowest astronomical tide (LAT), the lowest tide predicted in the full tidal cycle, but in non-tidal areas and some tidal areas Mean Sea Level (MSL) is used. Heights, e.g. a lighthouse, are generally given relative to mean high water spring (MHWS). Vertical clearances, e.g. below a bridge or cable, are given relative to highest astronomical tide (HAT). The chart will indicate what datum is in use. The use of HAT for heights and LAT for depths, means that the mariner can quickly look at the chart to ensure that they have sufficient clearance to pass any obstruction, though they may have to calculate height of tide to ensure their safety. Tidal races and other strong currents have special chart symbols. Tidal flow information may be shown on charts using tidal diamonds, indicating the speed and bearing of the tidal flow during each hour of the tidal cycle."], "neg": ["MV Murell\nMV Murell MV \"Murell was a coaster that was built in 1940 as Fiddown by Goole Shipbuilding & Repairing Co Ltd, Goole, Yorkshire, United Kingdom for S Morris Ltd.

{"query": "Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games broader impact beyond sports instead of fencing competition", "pos": ["Brazilian Olympic Committee\nBrazilian Olympic Committee The Brazilian Olympic Committee or BOC ( – COB) is the highest authority in Brazilian sport and the governing body of Brazilian Olympic sport. It was officially founded on June 8, 1914 but World War I caused its official activities to begin only in 1935. It was founded at the headquarters of the Brazilian Federation of Rowing Societies (\"Federação Brasileira das Sociedades de Remo\") as an initiative from the Metropolitan League of Athletic Sports (\"Liga Metropolitana de Esportes Atléticos\"). The BOC has multiple sources of income, but its principal means of funding is its 2% share of all the profits from the Brazilian National Lottery and other games of chance. The BOC is presided by Paulo Wanderley Teixeira, and its principal project is the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro. The BOC is responsible for enrolling Brazilian athletes in every Olympic Games. The policy used by the institution is the \"meritorious inclusion\". This means that the BOC does not hold Olympic Trials; all Brazilian athletes that meet the requirements set forth by their sport's International Federation for participation in the Games are automatically enrolled by the BOC in their respective Olympic event — if the country has a limited number of berths in any given event in the Games and the number of athletes meeting the criteria for qualification exceeds it, the BOC will then respect the official rankings of the sport, or any other criterion used by the sport's Federation for ranking purposes, and enroll the top ranked athletes to the limit of berths assigned to the country in the Games. National teams may qualify through pre-Olympic tournaments and/or international events that award berths in the Games; individual athletes, depending on their sport, may also qualify by achieving a certain minimum performance or time for the Games (e.g. in Swimming, where athletes qualify when they swim their event in a certain time). The BOC has a policy of never requesting \"inclusion berths\" in the Olympic Games: every country's Olympic Committee is entitled to request that the International Olympic Committee include athletes of that nationality in events to which they had not qualified, so long as the country in question had no athletes qualified when it had a right to enroll athletes in any given event; any national Olympic Committee may also request those berths if it has not reached the number of athletes that it had been assigned, which would cause the Olympic draws to diminish. As an example, if no Brazilian athletes were to succeed in qualifying for the Olympic Weightlifting event, then no Brazilian athlete will participate in the given Olympics, because the BOC will not request the enrollment of any athlete that has not achieved qualification on his or her own merit. This could be observed, for instance, in the Weightlifting event of the 2004 Summer Games, when no Brazilian athlete participated, even though the BOC could have requested a special inclusion for representation purposes. The Brazilian Olympic Committee has submitted official bids for hosting the Olympic Games. In Brazil, the BOC is the final authority for submitting a bid, and no Brazilian city may bid without BOC support. Brasília has made a bid for the 2000, but withdrew early before the final election. In recent times, the city of Rio de Janeiro has been the preferred candidate, having made bids for the 1936, 2004 and 2012 games. Rio failed to become a candidate city both times. Rio de Janeiro was elected to host the 2016 Games on its fourth bid submission in 2009. In 2004, when it was time to submit the bids for the 2012 games (ultimately awarded to London, Great Britain), the city of São Paulo contested the automatic choice of Rio de Janeiro as the natural Brazilian candidate. São Paulo insisted that it could produce a bid that would be more competitive than that of Rio de Janeiro. The BOC could only submit one national bid and decided to settle the issue internally, through a vote in which all registered members of the BOC would participate. Both cities were required to present their bid for the Games (as if it were being presented to the IOC members) for evaluation by the delegates voting. The result was a landslide in favor of Rio de Janeiro, and the BOC then submitted the city's bid for the Games. In 2017, The International Olympic Committee provisionally suspended Carlos Arthur Nuzman, president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, in a vote-buying case to guarantee Rio de Janeiro as city host of the 2016 Olympic Games. The national Confederations whose sports are part of the Olympic Program are directly linked to the BOC, but the entity also works with many \"Associated Confederations\", which are those whose sports are not part of the Olympic Program in the present.   In June 2005, the International Olympic Committee announced that both Baseball and Softball would be excluded from the Olympic Program as of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, to be held in London, United Kingdom. At this point, no change in status for the Baseball and Softball Confederation has been announced.", "International sport\nInternational sport The concept of international sport refers to sport when the participants represent at least two countries. The most well-known international sports event is the Olympic Games. Other examples include the FIFA World Cup and the Paralympic Games. Modern international sports events are big business for as well as influencing the political, economical, and other cultural aspects of countries around the world. Especially with politics and sports, sports can affect countries, their identities, and in consequence, the world. The ancient Olympic Games were a series of competitions held between representatives of several city-states and kingdoms from Ancient Greece, which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games, all struggles between the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend. During the 19th century, the Olympic Games became a popular global event. While some economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such \"mega-events\" often have large costs, hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society. The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups. Globalization has continually increased international competition in sports. The FIFA World Cup, for example, is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 700 million people watched the final match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa. According to a 2011 A.T. Kearney study of sports teams, leagues and federations, the global sports industry is worth between €350 billion and €450 billion (US$480-$620 billion). This includes infrastructure construction, sporting goods, licensed products and live sports events. The Olympics are a major factor in the globalization of sport. The Olympic symbol is the most recognized symbol, and the Olympic Games are broadcast around the world. This represents 4.5 billion of people for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Olympic Games have also undergone globalization. The first Olympic Games of the modern era were held in 1896, only 9 disciplines were present and 241 athletes but only men. The place of women is representative of the position of women in society, and from the first Olympiad 1900 women participated but unofficially. It is in 1920 that the first women were officially part of the Olympic Games. The number of athletes present at each Olympiad hast been increasing significantly since the first Olympiad:"], "neg": ["Brazil at the 1984 Summer Olympics\nBrazil at the 1984 Summer Olympics Brazil competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. 147 competitors, 126 men and 21 women, took part in 82 events in 17 sports.

{"query": "Josiah Marshall Heath biography instead of bat naming context", "pos": ["Josiah Marshall Heath\nJosiah Marshall Heath Josiah Marshall Heath (died 1851) was an English metallurgist, businessman and ornithologist, who invented the use of manganese to deoxidise steel. In India he learned the local steelmaking processes, including wootz, but having failed to found a profitable steel mill there he returned to England and settled in Sheffield. His patent kick-started Sheffield's steel industry, but the poor wording of his patent caused competitors not to pay him royalties, and he died in poverty. At the start of the 19th century, metallurgy in British India was very traditional, localised and artisanal. Around 1825, Heath (who wanted to continue the important progress of European methods), obtained from the British East India Company the monopoly of iron production over a large area centred on Madras. In 1830, factories were built at Porto Novo, in the south of the Arcot district, with a government loan. In 1833, the company was named the \"Porto Novo Steel and Iron Company\", the workshops were enlarged and a new factory was built at Beypore in the Malabar region. The steel was of very good quality, and was even exported to Great Britain where it was used, notably, in the construction of the Menai Suspension Bridge and the Britannia Bridge, across the Menai Straits between mainland Wales and Anglesey (). But the business ran at a loss, because of management failings, technical inexperience, lack of funding and the sole use of charcoal as a combustion agent. (A buyer had previously suggested to Heath that he move his factory to the Burdwan district of Bengal, where coal was abundant, but he did not act on the suggestion.) The business was taken over by the East India Company in 1853, who continued running it as a going concern until 1874, when it was placed into liquidation. On returning to England, Heath profited from his experience and observations of traditional Indian metalworking. In 1839 he filed a patent concerning the use of a compound of manganese and carbon which he had invented and called \"carbide\". This is not what is now called carbide, but was a mixture of only those two elements. This compound, together with the development of crucible steel, made the steel malleable when hot, and amenable to brazing and welding, even though the steel was formed from iron founded with addition of sulphur. Manganese carbide, as described by Heath, was made by heating the crucible with a mixture of manganese oxide and tar: at high temperature the carbon in the tar causes an oxygen reduction (\"redox\") in the manganese oxide. Heating the mixture is a costly process, so Heath proposed that his licencees add the manganese and charcoal directly to the crucible so as to make crucible steel. The heat necessary to make the steel also means the charcoal contributes to the redox of the manganese oxide. But although Heath's process removes the need for preparing the carbide separately, it also involves a loss of control over the process. It is difficult to apply his invention in isolation, because making steel in a crucible requires the use of other methods which are always kept as trade secrets – so that other steel producers contested the validity of Heath's patent as describing his actual process. Heath's innovation worked, but nobody would pay royalties on it. After nine years of legal proceedings, the British House of Lords (then the highest court in the land) recognised the patent in its aspect of the first use of manganese oxide. Thomas Webster, one of Heath's lawyers, wrote: Because of this, Heath was impoverished before he died. The general adoption of his process lowered the price of quality steel by 30% to 40% in the Sheffield market (Heath himself was content with a 2% reduction in the selling price). The Greater Asiatic yellow bat (\"Scotophilus heathi\") was named in his honour after he presented the type specimen to the Zoological Society of London, together with a large collection of Asiatic birds."], "neg": ["Jeff Heath\nJeff Heath John Geoffrey \"Jeff\" Heath (1 April 1915 – 9 December 1975) was a Canadian-born American left fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played most of his career for the Cleveland Indians. He was one of the American League's most promising power hitters of the late 1930s and early 1940s, twice led the AL in triples, and batted at least .340 with over 100 runs batted in (RBIs) each time. In 1941 he was selected to his first All-Star Game and that same season became the first player from the American League to become a member of the 20–20–20 club when he hit 20 each of doubles, triples and home runs in the same season. His other All-Star Game selections were in 1943 and 1945. Heath played for the Washington Senators and St. Louis Browns during the 1946 season and the National League's (NL) Boston Braves beginning in 1948. He incurred a compound fracture to his ankle in September 1948 and subsequently the Braves were without their starting left fielder for the 1948 World Series. In 1949, Heath's last season in the majors, sportswriter Franklin Lewis wrote, \"There was the inimitable Heath who...should have been one of the greatest players in history. But there were no valves on his temper. He grinned in the manner of a schoolboy or he snarled with the viciousness of a tiger.\" Heath was born 1 April 1915, in Fort William, Ontario. His family moved to Victoria, British Columbia before settling in Seattle, Washington. He attended Garfield High School in Seattle where he played baseball and football. As a freshman, he made the varsity baseball squad. Heath was a multi-sport athlete and was offered scholarships from various schools to play American football. University of Washington head coach Jimmy Phelan said Heath was the best fullback in the country. Heath chose a future in baseball, however, and in 1935, he signed with the Yakima Bears of the semipro Northwest League, where he hit .390. He was selected as an All-American amateur team member, managed by Les Mann and played games in Japan. For the tour his batting average was .483. Heath faced difficulties being allowed re-entry upon the team's arrival to the U.S. and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Cleveland Indians scout Willie Kamm helped sign Heath to a contract with the organization in 1936. Kamm said, \"If this kid isn't a big leaguer I've wasted a lot of time learning baseball.\" He reported to spring training with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association. One of his hands became infected and the Indians moved him to their Class C Mid-Atlantic team, the Zanesville Greys. With the Greys, he hit league-bests with 187 RBIs and a .383 average, while his 28 home runs were second-most. He was called up to join the Indians before the 1936 season ended. Heath, who batted left-handed and threw right-handed and broke in with the Indians in 1936 at the age of 21, appeared in 12 games with the club and recorded a .341 batting average and seven extra-base hits. During spring training leading up to the 1937 season, Heath was describing as getting \"as much attention as the backline of a Broadway chorus.\" He appeared in 20 games and hit .230 for the season. During spring training before the 1938 season, Indians manager Oscar Vitt said Heath was \"the best natural hitter I've seen since Joe Jackson.\" One columnist described Vitt's decision to employ Heath: In his first full season in 1938, he batted .343 – behind only batting champion Jimmie Foxx's .349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon the conclusion of the season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a .292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. \"It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes\", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, \"I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm not going to do that this season.\" During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low .219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh. Peckinpaugh announced in December 1940 Heath would remain a starting outfielder with the club. Heath came back in 1941 with a season campaign in which he again led the AL with 20 triples, batted .340 (fourth in the league), and was third in slugging behind Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. He also finished second in total bases and RBIs (behind DiMaggio) as well as second in hits, made his first All-Star team, and finished eighth in the Most Valuable Player award voting. He became the first AL player to make the 20-20-20 club, having recorded 20 doubles, triples and home runs in one season. Heath worked as a draftsman for Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation during the off-season leading up to 1943. In years previous, Heath had been described as \"lazy\" and \"lacking aggressiveness\" but the 1943 season appeared to be different, including investing extra time in batting practice. He was selected for the All-Star Game and finished fourth in the AL in home runs with 18. Heath was rejected in 1944 for military duty due to knee problems. During the 1944 season Heath was mainly used as a pinch-hitter. In the off-season he underwent knee surgery and entered a contract dispute with the Indians. He did not join the team until June of the 1945 season after a two-month holdout. Despite missing the beginning part of the season, he was still named an All-Star although the game was not played due to travel restrictions during World War II. He finished the season with a batting average of .305 and his 15 home runs were fifth in the AL. In 1943 he became the second player born outside the U.S. to hit 100 home runs, and he surpassed George Selkirk with his 109th home run in 1945. Heath, who had acquired the nickname \"Lord Jeff\", was called a \"problem child\" by Indian player-manager Lou Boudreau. Peckinpaugh once said that Heath \"could have been one of the greatest players. He had the ability to do about anything. He could run, he could throw, and he could hit. But he just had no hustle, no nothing. If a ball went by him, he just might walk after it.\" In December 1945 the Indians traded Heath to the Washington Senators where he started in right field. In 1946, Senators' President Clark Griffith agreed to send outfielder George Case to Cleveland in exchange for Heath. Of the trade, Griffith said, \"We've sacrificed plenty of speed for a man of tremendous hitting power.\" During spring training, the addition of Heath led to the Senators being described as a \"dark horse.\" The Associated Press continued: But Heath would appear in just 48 games with the Senators. He finished with the team hitting .283 with four home runs and 27 RBIs, his last game on 15 June before he was traded to the St. Louis Browns in mid-June for Al LaMacchia and Joe Grace. In his first game with the Browns on 17 June he went 1-for-3 with one RBI. The Browns, who were 23–32 at the time Heath joined the club, finished the 1946 season 66–88. Heath finished with 12 home runs and 57 RBIs in 86 games with the Browns. Again, the Heath tendency for resentment and trouble led to the Browns trade. Washington had a utility infielder, Sherry Robertson, who was the nephew of owner Clark Griffith. During games, Heath would ride Robertson on the bench, calling him \"owner's pet\", in reference to the possibility that Robertson was only on the team due to that relationship, and the possibility that Robertson was better paid than Heath. This was the subject of a column in the \"Washington Post\" after Heath was gone by longtime sports writer Shirley Povich, who hated to see the Heath bat leave Washington. The Browns were the second team in the AL to add black players to their roster after the Indians signed Larry Doby in July 1947. Willard Brown and Hank Thompson were teammates of Heath's during the 1947 season, but Heath was described as committing a \"petulant display of prejudice\" towards Brown after Brown hit a home run with one of Heath's old bats. Brown preferred to use a heavy bat and did not bring his own after being told by the Browns the team would supply him with bats. Brown found one of Heath's damaged bats and applied tape to the affix the knob to the end of the bat. When he tried to use the bat during a game, the umpire told him he could not use the bat with tape applied, so Brown discarded the loose fragments of the bat and proceeded to hit a home run during the at-bat. When he returned to the dugout, however, Heath destroyed the bat when he hit it against the dugout wall. Heath had a career-high 27 home runs during the 1947 season, but the Browns finished in eighth and last place in the AL. In the Browns' final game, Heath was already in the clubhouse showers when it was his turn to bat in the ninth inning. Upon the conclusion of the season, Browns management was looking to overhaul the team roster. Browns General Manager Bill DeWitt tried to shop Heath to a National League team rather than leave him in the AL. On 4 December it was announced the Boston Braves of the National League had acquired Heath. Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders all the way to the end of the 1948 season. In a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the remainder of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. \"I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. I looked at my foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off\", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle \"the biggest disappointment of my life.\" A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself \"Why did I slide?\" when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: Heath's regular season came to an end, as he batted .319 with 20 home runs on the season. The Braves' season came to an end after six games in the World Series as they lost to the Indians, four games to two. Heath played in the minors the following season before eventually rejoining the Braves during the 1949 season. In a game on 28 August, Heath helped tie the Cincinnati Reds with a home run in the ninth inning and helped win the game for the Braves with another in the 10th inning. He ended his final major league season after 36 games into the 1949 season. He batted .306 with nine homers and 23 RBIs. In October 1949, the Braves placed Heath on waivers and general manager John Quinn offered him a managing position with a team in the Braves farm system, but he never accepted Quinn's offer to manage. Baseball historian Bill James when summarizing the 1940s listed Heath as the recipient for his designation of \"A Better Ballplayer Than a Human Being.\" Southworth said, \"They told me when I got him from the American League that Heath was a troublemaker. If he is, I'd sure like to have eight other troublemakers like him.\" Before he retired from professional baseball, Heath appeared in 57 games for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. He was later fired from the team. In 1951, he was given a trial basis with the Rainiers but was never signed. Sportswriter Franklin Lewis interviewed Heath and asked if he would do anything differently in his career if he was given the chance. Heath responded, \"I wouldn't gag around as much. I shouldn't have popped off. It's all right for little guys to talk loud, but not a big ox like me.\" In his 14-season major league career, Heath posted a .293 batting average and a .509 slugging average, with 194 home runs, 1,447 hits, 887 RBIs, 777 runs, 279 doubles, 102 triples and 56 stolen bases in 1,383 games played. Bobby Thomson surpassed him in 1955 to become the major leagues' home run leader among foreign-born players. Heath was the first player to hit a home run in all AL and NL ballparks. He was named as one of the \"Top 100 Greatest Indians.\" In 1988 he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. He worked briefly as a scout for the Cleveland Indians. He later worked as a color commentator with the Rainiers and did advertising work in the Seattle area. During one game while Heath provided commentary, he cursed into the microphone on-air and later apologized. A station manager later approached him regarding the incident and Heath responded by throwing the manager down a flight of stairs. Heath died of a heart attack in Seattle at age 60. He had suffered a heart attack in 1957 at the age of 43. He was survived by two daughters and one son."]}

They were also known by the name Essendon Town, in order to distinguish them from the Essendon Football Club that played in the Victorian Football League (VFL). The club was formed as Essendon Town in 1900 and joined the VFA that year. Essendon already had a team which competed in the VFL but many locals protested that they were based at East Melbourne instead of Essendon. The Essendon Town Football Club came about as a result, a side which would play their home games in the district. A winless season in 1903 meant that they took home their first wooden spoon. In 1905, the club officially changed its name to the Essendon Football Club, the same name as the VFL club. To distinguish it from the VFL club, the club was referred to as Essendon (Association), Essendon (V.F.A.) or Essendon (A.) wherever there was confusion. The club's most successful period came between 1908 and 1914 when they competed in the finals each year and won back to back premierships in 1911 and 1912 – coincidentally, Essendon (League) won the VFL premiership in both of those years. In the 1912 premiership season, Essendon Association's full-forward Dave McNamara became the first VFA footballer to kick over 100 goals in a season.

He was a long-serving editor of the anti-fascist \"Searchlight\" magazine. The son of a Jewish woman and a nominally Anglican father, Gable grew up in post-war east London considering himself Jewish. As a youth, Gable was a member of the Young Communist League and the Communist Party of Great Britain, and worked as a runner on the Communist Party's \"Daily Worker\" newspaper, leaving after a year to become a Communist Party trade union organizer. He stood unsuccessfully for the Communist Party on 10 May 1962 at Northfield Ward, Stamford Hill, North London. He left the Communist Party because of their anti-Israel policy and because \"first and foremost [he has] always been a Jewish trade unionist\". Joined by other Jews and anti-fascists, many ex-serviceman and members of the (Spanish) International Brigades the militant anti-fascist organisation 62 Group was formed, to confront fascists organising on the streets. Gable organised intelligence for the 62 Group on fascists, including using infiltrators to help build a defence policy for the community against fascist attacks. This led to the formation of the anti-fascist magazine \"Searchlight\" in the mid-1960s, along with Reg Freeson, Joan Lestor, Maurice Ludmer and others. Gable and Ludmer remained active in Searchlight Associates and re-launched the magazine in 1975. By November 1963, David Irving was in England when he called the London Metropolitan Police with suspicions he had been the victim of a burglary by three men who had gained access to his Hornsey flat in London claiming to be General Post Office (GPO) telephone engineers. Gable was convicted in January 1964, along with Manny Carpel. They were fined £20 each, with Gable being fined an additional; £5 for the theft of a GPO pass. In 1984 Gerry Gable was commissioned by the BBC to produce research for a BBC Panorama programme Maggie's Militant Tendency. The episode was to focus on a claim of right-wing extremism in the Conservative Party. Gable claimed that his research drew upon the information previously published in \"Searchlight\". The claims by Gable that two Conservative party figures, Neil Hamilton and Gerald Howarth, were secret extremist Nazi supporters was met with libel action against the BBC. The programme had alleged (not admitted as evidence in court) that Hamilton gave a Nazi salute in Berlin while 'messing around' on a Parliamentary visit in August 1983. \"The Guardian\" reported that \"Writing for the \"Sunday Times\" after the collapse of the case, he admitted he did give a little salute with two fingers to his nose to give the impression of a toothbrush moustache. \"Somebody on the trip clearly did not share our sense of humour,\" he wrote.\" The BBC capitulated on 21 October and paid the pair's legal costs. Hamilton and Howarth were awarded £20,000 each and in the next edition of \"Panorama\" on 27 October, the BBC made an unreserved apology to both.

{"query": "Rail spur technology in urban planning instead of rural Georgia history", "pos": ["Industrial spur\nIndustrial spur An industrial spur is a type of secondary track used by railroads to allow customers at a location to load and unload railcars without interfering with other railroad operations. Industrial spurs can vary greatly in length and railcar capacity depending on the requirements of the customer the spur is serving. In heavily industrialized areas, it is not uncommon for one industrial spur to have multiple sidings to several different customers. Typically, spurs are serviced by local trains responsible for collecting small numbers of railcars and delivering them to a larger yard, where these railcars are sorted and dispatched in larger trains with other cars destined to similar locations. Because industrial spurs generally have less capacity and traffic than a mainline, they tend to have lower maintenance and signaling (train control) standards. Before the rise of the long-distance trucking in the early 1930s, railroads were the primary means of transportation around the world. Industries of the era were commonly built along railroad lines specifically to allow for easy access to shipping. Short (under a mile, oftentimes only several hundred yards) industrial spurs with very small (under ten car) capacities were a common sight along railroads in industrial and rural cities alike. As automobile and roadway technology improved throughout the early and mid 20th century, most low volume industry spurs were abandoned in favor of the greater flexibility and economic savings of trucking. Today, railroads remain the most economical way to ship large quantities of material, a fact that is reflected in industrial spurs. Most modern day spurs serve very large industries that require hundreds, if not thousands, of carloads a year."], "neg": ["Georgia Rail Passenger Program\nGeorgia Rail Passenger Program The Georgia Rail Passenger Program (GRPP) is a set of plans, as yet unbuilt, for intercity and commuter rail in the U.S. state of Georgia. Seven commuter routes were proposed to serve the Atlanta suburbs and nearby cities. The Athens, Georgia route will connect nine of Georgia's colleges and universities, including Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Emory University, Georgia Gwinnett College, and the University of Georgia. Furthermore, the commuter rail will link the Centers for Disease Control, the new Paul D. Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences, as well as the emerging BioScience Corridor along Georgia State Route 316. The route is estimated to divert 1.8 million drivers from the highways by 2025. As many as 8,000 individuals or more could conceivably use the system every day, and it could remove 5,300 cars daily from already overtaxed roadways during peak travel times. Also, previous studies have indicated that commuter rail is 25 times safer than driving. The Georgia Brain Train Group is a non-profit organization with the goal to educate the general public about the opportunities surrounding commuter rail. The group is made of community activists, business leaders, and professionals from every county and city along the proposed route. The group is led by self-described entrepreneur, re-developer, and former Georgia state representative Emory Morsberger of the Morsberger Group. Morsberger projects have previously included the revitalization of downtown Lawrenceville. As currently proposed, the route will cost $383 million as determined by a 2005 estimate. This price projection includes construction, rail stations, and rail cars. While tickets sales alone will not fully fund the $5 million in operating costs, it is important to note that no mass transit system in the United States operates without some form of government subsidies. Transit advocates often interpret transit subsidization as parallel to road building, which is typically totally subsidized, although ongoing operating costs may be lower. The Atlanta to Macon route was, as of 2006, seen as the first line ready for implementation, primarily because the railroad owner, Norfolk Southern had shown more interest than had CSX, the owner of the Athens line. In addition, the Clayton County Commission had offered to fund much of the operating costs of the line, over $106 million in funding was available from the U.S. Department of Transportation, and environmental assessment had been completed. In April 2006, a line was slipped into the state budget forbidding the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) from spending any funds on commuter rail without direct approval from the General Assembly. Rail advocates saw that as a last-minute sabotage of the program, as the General Assembly only meets for 40 days once a year. In addition, the Clayton County Commission in January 2007 withdrew its commitment to fund the operating costs of the line. There has been revived interest in the Lovejoy line in 2008 and the governor backed it in June. In January 2008, a delegation of GDOT members visited Philadelphia and Chicago to see how commuter rail systems in those cities was implemented. They also visited the LYNX light rail line in Charlotte. In early June, that delegation passed a mostly symbolic resolution urging state leaders to pass a transit policy. In June 2008, under intense pressure from businesses and Atlanta residents along with other politicians, Governor Sonny Perdue backed the Lovejoy line and said he wants it to be pursued aggressively. This may have been partially spurred by a visit the Governor previously had to rep. David Scott's office. David Scott warned that the deadline for acting on the federal dollars would run out soon. The Southern Railway operated this line heading west toward Birmingham, Alabama. The line continues to be used today for Amtrak's \"Crescent.\" Into the mid-1960s, the line had local service provided by the Frisco/Southern joint \"Kansas City-Florida Special\" and the Southern's #11/#12 train. This line of rail will run from Canton and connect into the Western and Atlantic Railroad line that runs from Atlanta to Acworth, then continue along the Western and Atlantic through Marietta, Smyrna, Cumberland, Vinings, and then the Bolton district of Atlanta, the Bankhead \"West midtown\" district of Atlanta (near Georgia Tech), then connect into either midtown via Atlantic Station or continue to Five Points, or both. Outside the city limits of Atlanta along this route, city populations total over 200,000 people if the high-density Cumberland district of Cobb County is included. Additionally, outlying areas would bring even more commuters. A funding mechanism has been found for build up to Marietta from Atlanta by using future years' revenue from CSX to pay back the initial costs of a quick build-out. <a href=\"http%3A//www.onlineathens.com/stories/041408/opinion_2008041400149.shtml\"></a> This line included a comuter operation until the early 1930s.

The Norfolk Southern Railway operates freight service on this line. Traditionally, this was the Georgia Railroad main line heading east towards Augusta. Traditionally, this was the Atlanta and West Point Railroad, heading southwest in the direction of Montgomery, Alabama.

{"query": "Manchester Town Hall interior design and historical events instead of its architect Alfred Waterhouse.", "pos": ["Manchester Town Hall\nManchester Town Hall Manchester Town Hall is a Victorian, Neo-gothic municipal building in Manchester, England. It is the ceremonial headquarters of Manchester City Council and houses a number of local government departments. The building faces Albert Square to the north and St Peter's Square to the south, with Manchester Cenotaph facing its southern entrance. Designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse, the town hall was completed in 1877. The building contains offices and grand ceremonial rooms such as the Great Hall which is decorated with Ford Madox Brown's imposing \"Manchester Murals\" illustrating the history of the city. The entrance and Sculpture Hall contain busts and statues of influential figures including Dalton, Joule and Barbirolli. The exterior is dominated by the clock tower which rises to and houses \"Great Abel\", the clock bell. In 1938, a detached Town Hall Extension was completed and is connected by two covered bridges over Lloyd Street. The town hall, which was granted Grade I listed building status on 25 February 1952, is regarded as one of the finest interpretations of Gothic revival architecture in the world. Manchester's original civic administration was housed in the Police Office in King Street. It was replaced by the first Town Hall, to accommodate the growing local government and its civic assembly rooms. The Town Hall, also located in King Street at the corner of Cross Street, was designed by Francis Goodwin and constructed during 1822–25, much of it by David Bellhouse. The building was designed with a screen of Ionic columns across a recessed centre, in a classicising manner strongly influenced by John Soane. The building was long and deep, the ground floor housed committee rooms and offices for the Chief Constable, Surveyor, Treasurer, other officers and clerks. The first floor held the Assembly Rooms. The building and land cost £39,587. As the size and wealth of the city grew, largely as a result of the textile industry, its administration outstripped the existing facilities, and a new building was proposed. The King Street building was subsequently occupied by a lending library and then Lloyds Bank. The facade was removed to Heaton Park in 1912, when a bank, 53 King Street was erected on the site. Planning for the new town hall began in 1863. Manchester Corporation demanded it be, 'equal if not superior, to any similar building in the country at any cost which may be reasonably required'. The choice of location was influenced by a desire to provide a central, accessible, but relatively quiet site in a respectable district, close to Manchester's banks and municipal offices, next to a large open area, suitable for the display of a fine building. After investigating suitable sites, including Piccadilly, an oddly shaped plot facing Albert Square was chosen. The Albert Square frontage measures , Lloyd Street is , Princess Street the longest at and Cooper Street measures . On this tight site, the corporation built a grand hall, a suite of reception rooms, quarters for the lord mayor, offices and a council chamber. The second stage of a competition to design the town hall which attracted 137 entries was judged by Thomas Leverton Donaldson, a classicist, and gothicist George Edmund Street. The eight finalists were Waterhouse, William Lee, Speakman & Charlesworth, Cuthbert Brodrick, Thomas Worthington, John Oldrid Scott, Thomas Henry Wyatt and Edward Salomons. In terms of design and aesthetics, Waterhouse's proposal was placed fourth behind those of Speakman & Charlesworth, Oldrid Scott and Worthington but his design was considered much superior for its architectural quality, layout and use of light and he was appointed architect on 1 April 1868. The foundation stone was laid on 26 October 1868 by the Mayor, Robert Neill. Construction took nine years and used 14 million bricks. Estimates for the cost of construction vary from £775,000 to around £1,000,000 translating to between £ and £ in 2024. When Queen Victoria refused to attend, Manchester Town Hall was opened on 13 September 1877 by the mayor, Abel Heywood, who had championed the project. In 1927, a competition to design the Town Hall Extension was won by Emanuel Vincent Harris, the architect who also won a competition to design the city's Central Library. Work began on the extension in 1934 and was completed by 1938. Charles Herbert Reilly, a contemporary architecture critic, thought the extension was 'dull' and 'drab' while Nikolaus Pevsner considered it was Harris's best work. It is linked to the town hall by glazed pedestrian bridges at first-floor level. By late 2014, the Town Hall was being described as \"being in urgent need of essential repair\" and modernisation. In a 2014 report, Manchester City Council highlighted the need to replace the building's heating and electrical systems, refurbish windows and high-level stonework and repair parts of the roofing. The cost of this work, including work on improving the adjoining square, are estimated to £2.2million. The rapid growth and accompanying pollution in Victorian cities caused great problems for architects including denial of light, overcrowding, awkward sites, noise, accessibility and visibility of buildings, and air pollution. Provision for \"the sufficiency of window light supplied throughout the building\" was addressed by the use of architectural devices: suspended first floor rooms, made possible by the use of iron-framed construction, skylights, extra windows and dormers, \"borrowed lights\" for interior spaces and glazed white bricks in conjunction with mosaic marble paving in areas where the light was \"less strong\". Clear glass was used in important rooms, with light-coloured tints for coloured glazing, as \"the sky of Manchester does not favour the employment of deeply stained glass.\" The building exemplifies the Victorian Gothic revival style of architecture, using themes and elements from 13th-century Early English Gothic architecture. Gothic features most prominent in the Manchester Town Hall are low rib vault ceilings and tall arched windows. The choice of the Gothic was influenced by the wish for a spiritual acknowledgement of Manchester's late medieval heritage in the textile trade of the Hanseatic league and an affirmation of modernity in the fashionable neo-Gothic style favoured over the Neoclassical architecture of Liverpool. Despite its medieval styling, the building was designed to support the practical technologies of the 19th century. It had gas lighting, and a warm-air heating system, which provided fresh air drawn through ornamental stone air inlets below the windows and admitted behind the hot water pipes and 'coils' into the rooms. Warmed, fresh air was fed into the stairwells and through hollow shafts within the spiral staircases to ventilate the corridors. Pipes supplying gas for lighting were ingeniously concealed underneath the banister rails of the spiral staircases. Waterhouse designed the building structure to be fireproof, using a combination of concrete and wrought-iron beams. In mid-19th-century Manchester, many important Georgian buildings were blackened by atmospheric pollution. By the 1870s the local soft red Collyhurst sandstone was deemed to be unsuitable for public buildings, and tough Pennine sandstones were preferred. The architectural competition entries were judged in part on their suitability for the \"climate of the district\", and sample stone types were investigated. Waterhouse believed it was a matter of great difficulty to find a stone \"proof against the evil influences of the peculiar climate of Manchester\" but decided that Yorkshire-quarried Spinkwell stone would resist \"the deleterious influences of Manchester atmosphere\". The interior decoration was chosen with a view to providing permanent colour and cleanable surfaces. Public corridors were faced with terracotta rather than plaster, and extensive use was made of stone vaulted ceilings, tiled dados and washable mosaic floors. Waterhouse's design used a Gothic style with limited carved decoration and a uniform colour, a departure from the high Victorian heaviness and colour used in contemporary Ruskinian Gothic buildings, and was criticised by some Manchester inhabitants for not being Gothic enough. The decision to spend large amounts of money on a building \"when most of its architectural effect would be lost because ruined by soot and made nearly invisible by smoke\" was criticised. Waterhouse avoided using a polychrome scheme as seen in High Victorian Gothic buildings such as St Pancras railway station believing it to be impractical as Manchester's industrial atmosphere would quickly ruin the effect and decided a uniform stone exterior was the better solution. Statues of notable figures in the city's history decorate its exterior, that of Agricola, founder of the Roman fort is over the main door and over its gable is a statue of St George. Statues of Thomas Grelley, first lord of the manor, Humphrey Chetham and Thomas de la Warre are among six at the corner of Albert Square and Princess Street. Waterhouse's design proved successful and although its exterior was blackened by the late 1890s, the stonework was in a suitable condition to be cleaned and restored to its original appearance in the late 1960s. The tall bell tower, the sixth tallest building in Manchester, houses a carillon of 23 bells: 12 are hung for full circle change ringing and were manufactured by John Taylor Bellfounders. The clock bell, \"Great Abel\", named after Abel Heywood, weighs 8 tons 2.5 cwt. Its clock, made by Gillett and Bland (predecessor of Gillett and Johnston), was originally wound using hydraulic power supplied by Manchester Hydraulic Power. The clock bell first rang on New Year's Day 1879, but cracked, was replaced in 1882, and then recast with all the bells in 1937. Its clock face bears the inscription \"Teach us to number our Days\", from Psalm 90:12. The clock bell is inscribed with the initials AH for Abel Heywood and the line \"Ring out the false, ring in the true\" from Tennyson's \"Ring Out, Wild Bells\". As of 2017, Change-Ringing is not currently permitted on the bells, due to the necessity of a restoration to the building.  Waterhouse's plan for the town hall bridged the gap between office and ceremonial requirements and maximised space on its triangular site. His design for a six-storey building filled the asymmetrical site. Set around its perimeter is a cloister of corridors linking offices and everyday workings. Its grandiose, ceremonial features are centrally located. By the main entrance on Albert Square are two grand staircases leading to the landing outside its Great Hall. The stairs have low risers allowing access for women in Victorian dress. The walls of the staircases have tall, arched windows admitting daylight. Three spiral staircases accessing the first floor from entrances on Princess Street, Lloyd Street and Cooper Street are constructed in English, Scottish and Irish granite. The ground-floor Sculpture Hall contains statues and busts of people who made significant contributions to Manchester, the Anti-Corn Law campaigners, Richard Cobden and John Bright, and scientists John Dalton and James Joule among many others. The room measures 53 feet by 33 feet and has a groin vaulted ceiling, constructed out of Bath stone. The Sculpture Hall Café is now located here. The landing has a glazed skylight on which the names of mayors, lord mayors and chairs of the council since Manchester received its Charter of Corporation in 1838 are inscribed on glass panes. The landing has a mosaic floor with a pattern of bees and cotton flowers, both symbols of Manchester. Influential Victorian critic John Ruskin described the Great Hall as \"The most truly magnificent Gothic apartment in Europe.\" The rectangular hall measures by . Natural light permeates from seven high windows on either side of the hall from the courtyards outside. It has a wagon roof, its ceiling divided into panels bearing the arms of countries and towns with which Manchester traded at the zenith of its mercantile power. \"The Manchester Murals\" by Ford Madox Brown, a sequence of 12 paintings depicting the history of Manchester decorate its walls. They are not true frescoes but use the Gambier Parry process. The organ installed by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in 1877 stands tall and had more than 5,000 pipes, five manuals and 65 speaking stops. Cavaillé-Coll cleaned it and added the solo organ in 1893. In 1912, T.C. Lewis of Brixton rebuilt it and added the echo division. Jardine of Manchester's minor rebuild in 1970 added the mobile five-manual console. The town hall is a Grade I listed building, One of fifteen Grade I listed buildings in Manchester, it is regarded as one of the finest interpretations of Gothic revival architecture in the world. F. A. Bruton wrote that \"The Town Hall ... is best viewed when the Square is empty and silent, as, for example, on Saturday afternoon or Sunday, and it is then that we may realise what a splendid \"ruin\" it will make, to excite the wonder of the South Sea Islander of the future.\" Dan Cruickshank described it as \"... arguably the greatest Gothic Revival public building anywhere in the world. It remains a glorious confection – functionally organised yet rich in inventive Gothic detail wrought out of beautiful and expensive materials.\" James Stevens Curl described it as \"a High-Victorian Gothic secular masterpiece that combines eclectic elements to form a style that can only be Victorian\". It was voted Greater Manchester's favourite building by readers of the \"Manchester Evening News\" in 2012 and in the same year featured in a series of Royal Mail stamps commemorating British landmarks. Council meetings are no longer regularly held in the town hall, but in the Town Hall Extension. The hall now has a number of other uses. It is licensed for weddings and civil partnerships and is available to hire for conferences and other events. Tours of the clock tower are available through external tour companies at a cost. As the town hall bears some resemblance to the Palace of Westminster, it has been used as a location for television and films. The 2003 BBC series \"State of Play\" was filmed here as were the films \"Ali G Indahouse\" in 2001, \"Sherlock Holmes\" in 2008, \"The Iron Lady\" in 2011, and \"Victor Frankenstein\" in 2014. In 2014, a 24-hour police station reopened in the town hall, after having been closed in 1937. Unlike the original, the new station does not include custody cells, but officers are able to conduct interviews there. Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley described the location as \"perfectly placed in the hub of the city\" and suitable to \"serve the needs of the public 24 hours a day.\" Overnight on 23 June and into Friday 24 June 2016 the venue was used to announce the official result of the EU Referendum by the chair of the Electoral Commission acting as Chief Counting Officer (CSO) Jenny Watson.

The brick-and-granite three-story structure was built in 1844-45 to a design by Boston architect Edward Shaw, and is a prominent early example of the Gothic Revival style in a civic building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Manchester's City Hall is the second building of that name, the first having been built on the same site in 1841, and burned in 1844. It is prominently set in the middle of the downtown, on the west side of Elm Street at its junction with Hanover Street. It is three stories in height, built out of brick with granite trim. It presents a five-bay facade to Elm Street and a three-bay facade to Market Street (now closed off as City Hall Plaza). The center of the three-bay facade projects slightly and rises in a tower two more stories above the building. The bays of the building and its corners are articulated by false buttresses, which rise to squat octagonal columns above the roof edge. Each bay has several narrow Gothic windows rising through the second and third floors. The tower has a clock with multiple faces on its main stage above the roof, which is ringed by a crenellated balustrade and octagonal columns. The top stage consists of an open lantern structure with Gothic openings and pinnacles. The hall was designed by Edward Shaw, a New Hampshire-born architect based in Boston, Massachusetts. Shaw is best known for a number of publications for builders, some of which received wide circulation. When first built, the Elm Street facade was taken up by retail space on the ground floor (in a style emulating the previous city hall which stood on the site), with city offices above; the main entrance was then through the base of the tower.

It formed the backbone of a waterway stretching some , linking a number of lakes and rivers to provide a route from Gothenburg (Göteborg) on the west coast to Söderköping on the Baltic Sea via the river Göta älv and the Trollhätte kanal, through the large lakes Vänern and Vättern. The canal itself is long, of which were dug or blasted, with a width varying between and a maximum depth of about . It has 58 locks and can accommodate vessels up to long, wide and in draft. Göta Canal is a sister canal of Caledonian Canal in Scotland, which was also constructed by Thomas Telford. The idea of a canal across southern Sweden was first put forward as early as 1516, by Hans Brask, the bishop of Linköping. However, it was not until the start of the 19th century that Brask's proposals were put into action by Baltzar von Platen, a German-born former officer in the Swedish Navy. He organised the project and obtained the necessary financial and political backing. His plans attracted the enthusiastic backing of the government and the new king, Charles XIII, who saw the canal as a way of kick-starting the modernisation of Sweden. Von Platen himself extolled the modernising virtues of the canal in 1806, claiming that mining, agriculture and other industries would benefit from \"a navigation way through the country.\" The project was inaugurated on 11 April 1810 with a budget of 24 million Swedish riksdalers. It was by far the greatest civil engineering project ever undertaken in Sweden up to that time, taking 22 years of effort by more than 58,000 workers. Much of the expertise and equipment had to be acquired from abroad, notably from Britain, whose canal system was the most advanced in the world at that time. The Scottish civil engineer Thomas Telford developed the initial plans for the canal and travelled to Sweden in 1810 to oversee some of the early work on the route. Many other British engineers and craftsmen were imported to assist with the project, along with significant quantities of equipment - even apparently mundane items such as pickaxes, spades and wheelbarrows. The Göta Canal was officially opened on 26 September 1832 in an event commemorated by the painter Johan Christian Berger in his work \"The Opening of the Göta Canal on 26 September 1832\". Von Platen himself did not live to see the completion of the canal, having died shortly before its opening. However, it was never an economic success. The arrival of the railways in 1855 quickly made it redundant, as trains could carry passengers and goods far more rapidly and did not have to shut down with the arrival of winter, which made the canal impassable for five months of the year. By the 1870s, the canal's goods traffic had dwindled to just three major types of bulk goods - forest products, coal and ore, none of which required rapid transportation. Traffic volumes stagnated after that and never recovered. Bishop Hans Brask's original justifications for the canal's construction were the onerous Sound Dues imposed by Denmark–Norway on all vessels passing through the narrow Øresund channel between Sweden and Denmark and the trouble with the Hanseatic League. The canal enabled vessels travelling to or from the Baltic Sea to bypass the Øresund and so evade the Danish toll. In 1851, the tycoon André Oscar Wallenberg founded the Company for Swedish Canal Steamboat Transit Traffic to carry goods from England to Russia via the canal. However, it only ran two trips between St Petersburg and Hull via Motala before the Crimean War halted Anglo-Russian trade. After the war ended, the great powers pressured Denmark into ending the four-hundred-year-old tradition of the Sound Dues, thus eliminating at a stroke the canal's usefulness as an alternative to the Øresund. The canal had one major industrial legacy in the shape of Motala Verkstad - a factory established in Motala to produce the machines such as cranes and steam dredgers that were needed to build the canal. This facility has sometimes been referred to as the \"cradle of the Swedish engineering industry\". After the canal was opened, Motala Verkstad focused on producing equipment, locomotives and rolling stock for the newly constructed railways, beginning a tradition of railway engineering that continues to this day in the form of AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning (ASJA) that was bought by the aeroplane manufacturer SAAB in Linköping. The Trollhätte Canal () is a canal in Sweden that is now part of the Göta Canal. It connects the Göta älv river with Lake Vänern. Ships classified as Vänermax are of the maximum dimensions that will fit through the canal. The maximum dimensions for a boat to traverse this canal are: This allows ships of around 4000 tonnes in total. The allowed height allows ocean going ships. Around 3.5 million tonnes of goods is freighted annually on Trollhätte Canal. Trollhätte Canal has six locks. They are from north to south: Parts of the canal are still used to transport cargo, but it is now primarily used as a tourist and recreational attraction, dubbed \"Sveriges blå band\" (\"Sweden's Blue Ribbon\"). Around two million people visit the canal each year on pleasure cruises - either on own boats or on one of the many cruise ships - and related activities. The canal is called the \"divorce ditch\" because of the troubles that couples have to endure while trying to navigate the narrow canal and the many locks by themselves. From the east-coast of Sweden to Lake Vänern the locks are as follows (with meters of height difference per lock):  \"Lake Vättern\" (88 m above sea level)  \"Lake Viken\" canal highest point  After Lake Vänern (44 m above sea level) Trollhätte kanal to Gothenburg and the west-coast of Sweden.", "Göta älv\nGöta älv The Göta älv (, \"River of the Geats\") is a river that drains lake Vänern into the Kattegat, at the city of Gothenburg, on the western coast of Sweden. It was formed at the end of the last glaciation, as an outflow channel from the Baltic Ice Lake to the Atlantic Ocean and nowadays it has the largest drainage basin in Scandinavia. The Göta älv is located in Götaland, with the river itself being a site of early Geatish settlement. Its length is . The Bohus Fortress is located by the river at Kungälv. There the river splits into two, with the northern part being the Nordre älv and the southern part keeping the name Göta älv. At Trollhättan there is a dam, canal locks and a hydropower station in the river. The locks make the river navigable, even for large cargo vessels ( long). The artificial parts are called Trollhätte Canal. The river and the canal is part of a mostly inland waterway, Göta Canal, which spans the width of Sweden to the Baltic Sea south of Stockholm. The power station supplied electric power to the heavy steel industry concentrated around Trollhättan Falls, contributing to its industrial revolution. In the summer months the spillway of the dam is opened for a few minutes daily and tourists gather to see the water rushing down the river (picture). There are concerns about whether the maximum discharge of is enough in a scenario where heavy rain floods the lake Vänern, causing considerable damage. Previously this was thought not to be possible in reality, but in 2001 the lake was flooded almost above maximum level (and some upstream lakes like Glafsfjorden flooded ). In this situation, Göta älv was allowed a discharge of for months causing a big risk of landslides. Now a water tunnel between Vänersborg and Uddevalla is considered as a rescue solution. There is a large risk of landslides along the river and historical records of 15 landslides exist. The largest occurred in the years 1150, 1648, 1950, 1957 and 1977 (Tuve landslide). In Old Norse the river was called the \"Gautelfr\"; in Icelandic it is \"Gautelfur\"; and in Norwegian sometimes rendered as \"Gøtelv\"."], "neg": ["Gosen Canal\nGosen Canal The Gosen Canal () is a canal in the eastern suburbs of Berlin, the capital city of Germany.

The Dämeritzsee and Seddinsee are both navigable, with the Seddinsee providing a link to the River Dahme and the Oder-Spree Canal, and the Dämeritzsee providing a link to the Müggelspree reach of the River Spree and to the Flakensee.  Although the plan for the Gosen Canal goes back to 1872, construction did not start until 1933, and the canal opened in 1936.

Working with the national governing bodies of each sport, the BOA selects Team GB's members to compete in all sports at the summer and winter Olympics. The BOA is independent and receives no funding from the government. Its income comes from fundraising and events. The United Kingdom (which competes as \"Great Britain\") is one of only five countries (the others being Australia, France, Greece and Switzerland) which have never failed to be represented at the Summer Olympic Games since 1896. Of these countries Great Britain, France and Switzerland are the only countries to have been present at all Olympic Winter Games, thus Great Britain is one of three countries that have competed at all Olympic Games. Great Britain is also the only nation in the Olympic Games to have won a Gold in every games. Great Britain has hosted three Olympic Games, all of them in London: in 1908, 1948 and 2012, which is the record for any city. At its formation in 1905 the association consisted of seven national governing body members from the following sports: fencing, life-saving, cycling, skating, rowing, athletics, Rugby football, Association football, and archery. It now includes as its members the thirty-three national governing bodies of each Olympic sport, both summer and winter. A representative of each of the Olympic sports makes up the NOC, the BOA's decision and policy-making body. The NOC elects three officers: a President, a Chairman, and a Vice-Chairman, each for a four-year term. Six members of the NOC are elected to the Board, which oversees the work of the BOA and puts forward proposals for decision by the NOC.   The BOA's origins pre-date the International Olympic movement and its governing body, the International Olympic Committee. It traces its roots back to the National Olympian Association (NOA), which held its inaugural meeting at the Liverpool Gymnasium, Myrtle Street, Liverpool in November 1865. It promoted an annual series of sporting events across Britain, with the aim of encouraging participation in Physical Education through Olympian festivals. The NOA came about mainly through the efforts of John Hulley of Liverpool (Chairman), Dr. William Penny Brookes (of Much Wenlock) and E G Ravenstein (president of the German Gymnastic Society of London). It took the existing Olympian Games of Much Wenlock as its example, thus the NOA Games \"were open to all comers\" and not just the products of Britain's public schools.

{"query": "Slarrow Mill preservation efforts instead of industrial uses in North Leverett", "pos": ["Mill conversion\nMill conversion Mill Conversion or mill rehab is a form of adaptive reuse in which a historic mill or industrial factory building is restored or rehabilitated into another use, such as residential housing, retail shops, office, or a mix of these non-industrial elements (mixed-use). In the United States the development of industry during 19th and early 20th century resulted in the construction of thousands of mills or factory buildings typically of brick or stone masonry construction across the nation, with a high concentration in the Northeast. By 1920, there were hundreds of mill towns across the region built for the production of textiles and other goods, such as shoes, machinery and other items. However, the Northern textile industry would suffer greatly beginning in the early 1920s, with the failure of many of these companies, and the rise in competition from Southern mills. Other industries would follow, especially during the later part of the 20th century, when globalization changed the economy, and entire industries began to move overseas to developing nations. Through the 20th century, many mills carried on in a variety of industrial purposes, other than original intended use. Many were used for storage, or other small enterprises. Still, many more remained mostly vacant and underutilized through the middle part of the 20th century, and even today. Many vacant mill buildings have become a target for vandalism, arson and contribute to urban blight in many communities. A similar scenario has also played out in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe during this same timeframe. Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large public outcry throughout the United States for an increase in historic preservation, to stop the loss of historic structures that began during the 1950s with urban renewal projects in big cities and small towns across the nation. A similar movement occurred in Great Britain decades earlier. One result of this outcry was the establishment of the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, by the Federal Government. Since this time, more than one-million listings have been added to the National Register, on many types of structures and places across the country. While not a certain guarantee that a structure will never be demolished, the National Register provides owners with a tool to seek national and state tax credits, grants and other assistance that may enable the rehabilitation of the building. Since the 1960s communities across the country have established Historic Districts and special by-laws in an attempt to preserve and prevent the destruction of properties deemed important to the context of history. The first successful textile mill in the United States was Slater Mill, established by Samuel Slater in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1793. With its significant historic value, the drive to restore Slater Mill into a public museum began during the mid-20th century. In 1971, the Brandywine River Museum of Art opened in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania in a converted Civil War-era grist mill. The mill (and an additional 8 1/2 acres) was purchased at auction by the newly formed Brandywine Conservancy. Renovations began in 1970 and the museum opened in 1971. The renovation was done by James R. Grieves Associates, Inc. of Baltimore. Grieves was the only professional consulted who wanted to keep the 19th structure intact. Other architects recommended tearing it down and starting over. The museum exhibits Wyeth and American art, with galleries devoted to the works of N.C., Andrew, and Jamie Wyeth. In 1976, Lowell Heritage State Park was established in Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1978, the United States Congress established Lowell National Historical Park and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission. The legislation to create the park was sponsored by United States Senator and Lowell native Paul Tsongas. The restoration gathered momentum in the 1980s, including the renovation of the canals and former mill facilities into museums, as well as the construction of a waterfront walkway. During the 1980s, with the example of Lowell's National Historic Park coming into fruition, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts established a series of Heritage State Parks throughout the state to celebrate and preserve the state's valuable historic (mostly industrial) history. Lawrence Heritage State Park, which occupies a former mill boardinghouse in the city's industrial canal district, is an excellent example. In 1999, the former Arnold Print Works mills in North Adams, Massachusetts was converted into the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMOCA). Not all historic mills can be successfully transformed into museums however, only with the few, most significantly historic ones has this been possible. Since most mills were initially zoned as \"industrial\" with the emergence of zoning ordinances during the mid- and late 20th century, an early obstacle of many planners and developers in transforming these vacant or underutilized mill spaces into residences was to convince local officials that the usefulness of the mills for continuing industry was limited. Business practices were changing, and the old mill buildings were no longer efficient or practical for industry. Even today, most jurisdictions require some sort of special permit or zoning change in order for the conversions to take place. One of the earliest known conversions of a historic textile mill into residential apartments is the Valley Falls Company south mill located in Central Falls, Rhode Island. This project was completed in 1979, and now includes 133 units of elderly housing. Other mill conversion projects during the 1980s include the Border City Mill Apartments in Fall River, Massachusetts, situated in a historic 1870's brick cotton mill. The huge Massachusetts Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts were converted into a 445-unit apartment complex beginning in 1990, while the nearby Market Mills Apartments have 230 units. In recent years, with Massachusetts historic tax credit program, the Boott Mills and Lawrence Mills have been converted into residences also, as part of Lowell's continued revitalization of its historic waterfront area. Mill conversions have also occurred in other parts of the United States, such as the Cotton Mill Condos in New Orleans, completed in 1997. In recent years, there has been a trend toward the loft style apartment or condominium unit, with high ceilings, exposed bricks, tall windows, wood floors, and exposed beams or structural elements. One of the most ambitious mill conversion projects in recent years is the transformation of the huge Wood Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Built in 1906, it was the largest textile mill in the world at the time. The project is known as Monarch on the Merrimack. Concurrent with the move to restore former industrial mills into residences, has been the conversion of certain sites into a mix of retail shops, offices and restaurants and other non-industrial uses. During the 1980s, many of the historic cotton mills in Fall River, Massachusetts were converted into factory outlet stores, although with minimal physical alteration other than some partitions and carpeting. The factory outlet stores in Fall River were highly successful for many years, but have in recent years declined, a victim of newer \"premium outlet\" malls opening up in nearby suburban areas such as Wrentham, Massachusetts, and others. One excellent example of a mill to mixed-use conversion in New England is the Clocktower Place, located in the small town of Maynard, Massachusetts. The huge mill complex was originally the Assabet Manufacturing Company, which grew during the 19th century to be one of the largest textile companies in the state, specializing in woolen goods. It was later acquired by the American Woolen Company, and later, by Digital Equipment Corporation, until it finally vacated the location in 2001. Since then, the entire complex has been transformed into an office park. It is now home to many companies in differing markets. Its most famous tenant is perhaps Monster.com. The largest mill to mixed-use conversion in New England however, can be found at Manchester, New Hampshire, with the successful renovation and conversion of the Amoskeag Millyard, once the largest single textile company in the world. The Amoskeag Millyard is the centerpiece of Manchester's waterfront, and includes offices, restaurants, a museum, residences and a university. Often, parking, utilities and other infrastructure need to be upgraded as part of the mill conversion process. Many of the old industrial sites contain levels of contamination, which can be very costly for the developers to mitigate. In recent years, many states have enacted Historic Tax Credit programs in an attempt to enable the rehabilitation of older structures deemed to be \"historically significant\". Typically, the major criteria for this determination is a listing with the National Register of Historic Places, usually followed by a review by state and local agencies. The development companies typically utilize the tax credits to offset the usually expensive process of renovation and site cleanup. An example of a Mill conversion utilized by the use of a state historic tax program is the Royal Mills in West Warwick, Rhode Island, redeveloped by SBER a Baltimore-based company with a long history of historic preservation projects. This mill had sat vacant for many years, and was in serious threat of being demolished. The site has since successfully been converted into residential apartments, situated on the Pawtuxet River with a walking trail and bike path nearby. While recently suspended due to the State's budget crisis, Rhode Island's Historic Tax Credit Program was deemed as one of the most successful in the nation, enabling hundreds of historic structures across the state to be preserved over the past several years since it was enacted. The benefits historic tax credit programs to state budgets have been often controversial, but there are many indirect economic benefits to local communities. The property tax value of a restored mill it typically about ten times greater than the existing underutilized mill building, and there is also the added benefit of many construction jobs and other services during the renovation process. The intangible value of having a historic factory building preserved for future generations to enjoy, as well as the benefits to the community are often harder to calculate. The restored mill buildings often become the focal point of the community."], "neg": ["Laurel Mill\nLaurel Mill The Laurel Mill was a multi-use mill located along the Patuxent River in Laurel, Maryland. Built by Nicholas Snowden on the site of an earlier grist mill, Laurel Mill operated intermittently between 1811 and 1929, manufacturing flour, cloth, cotton duck and other cotton products, and window shades. Between 1835 and 1851 the mill was operated by Horace Capron, who had married into the Snowden family, and the Patuxent Manufacturing Company, who also established the town of Laurel Factory, which was incorporated as Laurel in 1870. Laurel Mill closed by 1929 and was razed in the 1940s, and the grounds of the mill are now the City of Laurel Municipal Pool. The Laurel Museum currently sits opposite the Laurel Mill site, in a home constructed by the mill company. The first building on the site of the Laurel Mill was a stone grist mill constructed in 1811 by Nicholas Snowden, a member of a prominent Maryland family. Snowden's parents \"Major\" Thomas Snowden and Ann Ridgely constructed a five-part, Georgian-style home, Montpelier Mansion, near the Patuxent River between 1781 and 1785. Nicholas Snowden was born at Montpelier Mansion in 1786, and owned the mansion from 1803 until his death in 1831. In addition to operating his family's 9,000 acre plantation and the Patuxent Ironworks, Snowden opened the grist mill in 1811; by 1820 the mill employed two workers and produced 10-15,000 bushels of flour. In 1834 Horace Capron, a businessman who had operated several mills, including Savage Mill in Savage, Maryland, married Nicholas Snowden's daughter Louisa Snowden. A year later, in 1835, he formed the Patuxent Manufacturing Company and expanded on the Laurel Mill building. Aided by the recent construction of the B&O Railroad, manufacturing boomed at Laurel Mill in the 1840s. By 1845 Capron operated both the Laurel Mill, then called Laurel Factory, and newly built Avondale Mill, employing between 700-800 women and men between the two buildings. Business slowed soon after, and according to the 1850 census Patuxent Manufacturing Company only had 500 employees. That same year the company built a larger dam on the Patuxent River to allow it to shift from water wheel to water turbine power, and also added small steam engines. In 1851 Horace Capron declared bankruptcy and soon after moved to Texas. Ownership of the mill was taken over by the Tiffany family of Baltimore, one of Capron's business partners. The mill went under the management of Robert Pilson, who operated the facility under a reduced 11-hour workload producing 4-4 Brown muslin \"Laurel-D\". A fire destroyed the mill in 1855, the same year mill workers went on strike for shorter hours. Already facing multiple business difficulties, the mill shut down operations during the Civil War. During Capron's time in Laurel, the Patuxent Manufacturing Company oversaw the construction of fifty two-story stone and brick tenement style houses to rent to mill employees. Several of these buildings still stand on Main Street, including the building that now houses the Laurel Museum. As the number of men and women employed at the mill increased, the community in the surrounding environs grew into a company town, then known as of Laurel Factory. The company town of Laurel Factory was incorporated in 1870 as the city of Laurel, and the mill continued to be the primary employer in the city. George Nye, a Civil War veteran, served as superintendent of Laurel Mill from 1877 to 1885, during which the mill frequently was closed due to renovations or shortages of manufacturing material. Ownership of the mill passed hands frequently in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and after Nye's departure the building was auctioned off, and later operated under the name The Laurel Company. Operations at the Laurel Mill in the early twentieth century focused solely on cotton duck. In 1901, the Laurel Mills company was consolidated into the Cotton Duck Company (of the Mount Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Company). In 1911 the Consolidated Cotton Duck Company was leased by the Ramie Company of New England. During World War I, much like during the Civil War, mill operations shut down, and the building housed soldiers from Camp Meade, which later became Fort George G. Meade. Between 1922 and 1929 the mill built window shades for the Lapsley Interstate Shade Cloth Company, and shut down in 1929. The building and mill race stood until the 1940s, when it was destroyed. The abandoned dam remained across the Patuxent River until the 1960s, and a portion of the bulwark on the Prince George's County side of the river remains standing.", "Lawton Mills Historic District\nLawton Mills Historic District The Lawton Mills Historic District in Plainfield, Connecticut encompasses a well-preserved early-20th-century mill village. The central focus of the district is the large brick mill complex to the south of Railroad Avenue on the banks of Horse Brook. The mill ownership developed the areas on either side of the mill complex with a substantial worker housing complex. The district includes more than 100 historically significant structures, most of which are worker house that has survived with generally only modest alterations. There are a few commercial buildings in the district, built to provide services to the works, and a community hall, which now serves as Plainfield's town hall. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The historic district is bounded on the east by Norwich Road (Connecticut Route 12), the north by Railroad Avenue, and the west by Third Street. The complex was started in 1905 by Harold Lawton, a superintendent at the Baltic Mill complex in Sprague, and doubled in size in 1911. Originally the site of a foundry in the 19th century, Lawton's mill turned out fine combed cotton textiles, reaching a maximum capacity of 130,000 spindles and employing as many as 1,200 people. Between 1906 and 1911 Lawton built 125 Colonial Revival duplexes as housing for some of those workers. The success of the mill prompted the growth of Plainfield's commercial district, including the construction of an opera house, bank, and several large commercial blocks. The company suffered financial reverses during the Great Depression, and closed in 1936. A portion of the former mill complex has been demolished and replaced by a large modern warehouse.", "Lightfoot Mill\nLightfoot Mill The Mill at Anselma (a.k.a. Lightfoot Mill) is an archetypal small, 18th century custom grain mill in Anselma, outside Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. It is probably the only surviving one in the United States with an intact colonial-era power transmission system. A custom grain mill typically ground cornmeal and flour only for local farmers, not for commercial distribution. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Samuel Lightfoot built this custom grist mill in c. 1747 to mill flour for Chester Springs' early residents. During three centuries of operation, the Mill evolved to meet changing needs and became the center of the community of Anselma. The first of eight grist mills established in the Township of Pikeland, the Mill at Anselma was never the largest nor the most valuable. However, it provided a vital local flour milling service for early settlers living in Philadelphia's backcountry against the backdrop of a flourishing American grain economy in the late 18th century. By the mid- 19th century, Lightfoot's Mill supported Chester County's growing livestock and dairy economy by milling animal feed as well as flour under the ownership of John Oberholtzer. In 1872, the Pickering Valley Railroad connected Anselma's vibrant farming community with the markets of Philadelphia. The Mill at Anselma was also home to the respected poet and social activist Sara Louisa Vickers Oberholtzer, who used her surroundings as a backdrop for some of her most revered works, \"At the Old Mill\" and \"Lost Music.\" The Mill's final miller, Oliver E. Collins, and his family came to Anselma in 1919. As the Great Depression descended on America in 1929, the Collins family resourcefully relied on their colonial-era grist mill to make a living. The family ran a saw mill and cider press, milled animal feed, and operated the Anselma Post Office from their home. Mr. Collins assembled a machine shop to create a repair service and sharpen lawn mower blades, and even cut hair for local residents. 1747–1812 Samuel Lightfoot, William Lightfoot, Samual Lightfoot 1812–1820 Lewis Rees, James Benson 1820–1859 Rees Sheneman 1859–1886 John Oberholtzer 1886–1919 Allen H.

In 1999, the Mill at Anselma Preservation and Educational Trust was formed to complete the nill's restoration and create an innovative historical attraction for the enjoyment of schoolchildren, scholars, visitors, and the community. Today, the Mill at Anselma connects visitors with America's rich industrial and agricultural past through tours and milling demonstrations. The Mill sells its own stoneground flour and cornmeal, and hosts a weekly farmer's market on its historic grounds. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005."]}

Established in 1919 by the Parliament of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the University started with faculties of history and philology; physics and mathematics; law and medicine with an initial enrollment of 1094. The first rector of BSU was V.I.Razumovsky, a former professor of surgery at Kazan University. In 1930, the government ordered the University shut down in accordance with a reorganization of higher education, and the University was replaced with the Supreme Pedagogical Institute. However, in 1934 the University was reestablished again, and continued to work through the difficult years of World War II experiencing a shortage of faculty members. By its 40th anniversary in 1959, the University already had 13 faculties. The Azerbaijan Medical University and Azerbaijan State Economic University were both spun-offs of the original respective faculties at BSU. Among the graduates of BSU were two former presidents of Azerbaijan, Abulfaz Elchibey and Heydar Aliyev. The former graduated from the Faculty of Arabic Language and Literature, while the latter, who dominated Azerbaijan's political life for over 30 years, from the Faculty of History. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Lev Landau studied at BSU between 1922 and 1924. BSU is the only university from Azerbaijan Republic ranked by international ranking organizations, such as University Ranking by Academic Performance and currently ranks at 1872 in the University Ranking by Academic Performance. BSU was established on September 1, 1919 by the decision of the Parliament of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The University was established as a part of 4 faculties (history and philology, physics and mathematics, law, and medicine). The first rector of the University was the famous surgeon V. I. Razumovsky. Among the leading professors in 1920-40 were Azerbaijani writer Abdurrahim bek Haqverdiyev, Orientalist Professor P.K. Juze, Professor A.O. Makovelski, Professor A.O. Mishel and other scholars. During that period the administration of the university invited to Baku such teachers as N.Y. Marr, V.V. Bartold, the academician of the Eastern Science Academy Fuad bek Kuprulluzade. In 1930 the university was liquidated according to the decision made by Council of the People’s Commissar on reorganization. The High Pedagogical Institute was created. Only in 1943 the state university resumed its activity and very soon became the republic’s scientific-pedagogical center. Despite the great shortage of university teachers because most of teachers went to the Second World War, the university managed to keep its leading position. In 1945 the teachers took an active part in founding the Azerbaijan Academy of Science. Most of the republic's universities and Mdash; such as Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan University of Economy, Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University and others — were founded on the basis of Baku State University. The years after 1969 can be considered as the years of development in the direction of knowledge and science. Covering a wide historical period, in those years there were founded faculties on modern specialties, departments and about 30 scientific research laboratories started. As a result, there was created a strong assurance of future development. University began to develop further after Heydar Aliyev came to power. Modern specialities, departments and scientific laboratories started to operate at university. With its rich historical background, Baku State University has always been a major scientific and educational center of Azerbaijan. Famous scientists, intellectuals and politicians and Azerbaijan's outstanding politician, Heydar Aliyev graduated from Baku State University. Currently, Baku State University has 16 majors with 55 bachelor and 153 master's degrees. Through time, the university builds its international relations. Currently BSU has membership in various associations and institutions as Association of Universities of Eurasia, which unites most universities of the former USSR. Between 2002-2004, BSU led the Association of Universities of Black Sea States. Furthermore, the university has signed agreements on scientific and technical co-operation, student-teacher exchange programs with Moscow State University, Middle East Technical University, Nice-Sofia Antipole University, Indiana University, Kiyev National University, Vienna University and other high-ranking universities. As a result of these collaborations, the university holds joint scientific conferences, workshops as well as publishing of textbooks.

MacArthur Foundation typically to between 20 and 30 individuals, working in any field, who have shown \"extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction\" and are citizens or residents of the United States. According to the Foundation's website, \"the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential\". The current prize is $625,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments. This figure was increased from $500,000 in 2013 with the release of a review of the MacArthur Fellows Program. Since 1981, 942 people have been named MacArthur Fellows, ranging in age from 18 to 82. The award has been called \"one of the most significant awards that is truly 'no strings attached'\". The Program allows no applications. Anonymous and confidential nominations are invited by the Foundation and reviewed by an anonymous and confidential selection committee of about a dozen people. The committee reviews all nominees and recommends recipients to the President and board of directors. Most new Fellows first learn of their nomination and award upon receiving a congratulatory phone call. MacArthur Fellow Jim Collins described this experience in an editorial column of \"The New York Times\". Cecilia Conrad is the Managing Director leading the MacArthur Fellows Program.", "MacArthur Foundation\nMacArthur Foundation The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is the 12th-largest private foundation in the United States. Based in Chicago, the Foundation makes grants and impact investments to support non-profit organizations in Chicago, across the U.S., and in approximately 50 countries. MacArthur reports that it has awarded more than US$6.8 billion since its first grants in 1978. According to the Foundation, it has an endowment of $7.0 billion and provides approximately $260 million annually in grants and impact investments. The Foundation's stated aim is to support \"creative people, effective institutions, and influential networks building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world.\" MacArthur's current grant-making priorities include mitigating climate change, reducing jail populations, decreasing nuclear threats, supporting nonprofit journalism, and funding local priorities in its hometown of Chicago. The MacArthur Fellows Program, also referred to as \"genius grants\", awards $625,000 no-strings-attached grants annually to about two dozen creative individuals in diverse fields. The Foundation's \"100&Change\" competition awards a $100 million grant every three years to a single proposal. John D. MacArthur owned Bankers Life and Casualty and other businesses, as well as considerable property holdings in Florida and New York. His wife, Catherine, held positions in many of these companies. Their attorney, William T. Kirby, and Paul Doolen, their CFO, suggested that the family create a foundation to be endowed by their vast fortune. One of the reasons MacArthur originally set up the Foundation was to avoid taxes. When MacArthur died on January 6, 1978, he was worth in excess of $1,000,000,000. He left 92 percent of his estate to found the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The composition of the Foundation’s first board of directors, per MacArthur’s will, also included J. Roderick MacArthur, John's son from his first marriage, two other officers of Bankers Life and Casualty, and radio commentator Paul Harvey. Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, later joined the Foundation's board of directors. MacArthur believed in the free market. However, MacArthur did not spell out specific parameters for how his money was to be spent after he died. MacArthur told the Foundation's board of directors, \"I figured out how to make the money. You fellows will have to figure out how to spend it.\" Between 1979 and 1981, John's son J. Roderick MacArthur, an ideological opponent of his father with whom the elder MacArthur had an acrimonious relationship, waged a legal battle against the Foundation for control of the board of directors. The younger MacArthur sued eight members of the board, accusing them of mismanagement of the Foundation's finances. By 1981, most of the original board had been replaced by members who agreed with J. Roderick MacArthur's desire to support liberal causes. This ultimately resulted in the creation of what, in 2008, historian and conservative commentator Martin Morse Wooster called \"one of the pillars of the liberal philanthropic establishment.\" In 1984, MacArthur again sued the board of directors, asking a Cook County circuit court to liquidate the entire MacArthur Foundation. He dropped the suit later that same year when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. John E. Corbally, the first president of the Foundation and later board chairman from 1995 to 2002, was followed in 1989–99 by Adele Simmons, who was the first female dean at Princeton University. Jonathan Fanton, president of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, served as the Foundation's next president. Robert Gallucci, formerly dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, served as the Foundation's fourth president from 2009 to 2014. Gallucci was fired in 2014, with the Foundation's board announcing it was \"looking for a new kind of leadership.\" Julia Stasch, who formerly served as MacArthur's vice president for U.S. Programs, was named the Foundation's president in 2015. Stasch had formerly served as chief of staff to Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. She announced that she would step down in 2019. The MacArthur Fellowship is an award issued by the MacArthur Foundation each year, to typically 20 to 30 citizens or residents of the United States, of any age and working in any field, who \"show exceptional merit and promise for continued and enhanced creative work.\" The program was initiated in 1981. According to the Foundation, the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but an investment in a person's originality and potential. MacArthur Fellows receive $625,000 each, which is paid out in quarterly installments over five years. No one can apply for the program, and, generally, no one knows if he or she is being considered as a candidate. Nominators, serving confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time, are invited to recommend potential Fellows. Candidates are reviewed by a Selection Committee, whose members also serve confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time. Ultimately, the Committee makes recommendations to the Foundation's Board of Directors for final approval. In June 2016, the foundation put out a call for \"proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location.\" The winning proposal would receive a $100 million grant.

{"query": "Dutch Harbor civilian life and economy instead of naval base operations during World War II", "pos": ["Dutch Harbor\nDutch Harbor Dutch Harbor is a harbor on Amaknak Island in Unalaska, Alaska. It was the location of the Battle of Dutch Harbor in June 1942, and was one of the few sites, besides the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, in American territory to be bombed by the Japanese during World War II. Dutch Harbor is now the home of an important fishing industry. Druzhinin, the commander of the Russian ship \"Zakharii I Elisaveta\", is credited for discovering the deep-water harbor now known as Dutch Harbor. Dutch Harbor is located within the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, more precisely on Amaknak Island in the Fox Islands. A mile long spit extending from the northeast end of Amaknak Island makes Dutch Harbor a natural port, protecting ships from the waves and currents of the Bering Sea, although winds off the Bering Sea have tossed shipments from decks of ships. Dutch Harbor is close to some of the richest fishing in the world, and it is ice-free. The native people are known as the Aleut. When the Russians arrived, they exploited the Aleut by taxing them in fur pelts. The Aleut accepted the Russian Orthodox Church because it offered them support and educated their children. The Russian-American Company operated from 1799 through the mid-1800s. It used Dutch Harbor in the transport of goods, mainly seal and sea otter fur. In 1867 Russia sold Alaska to the United States. Fur was the main export in Alaska after the United States took control. Hutchinson, Kohl, & Company of San Francisco took over the assets of the Russian America Company in 1867, but it sold out in 1868 to the Alaska Commercial Company. A decline in the sea otter population slowed trade in 1895. The year 1897 brought a crowd of potential prospectors looking to get rich from the Alaska gold rush. World War II brought the U.S. Army and Navy, and their supplies, to Dutch Harbor at the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army. The first army troops arrived in June 1941 and the navy air base was finished in September 1941. During the war, Dutch Harbor was also used to house refugees evacuated from other Aleutian Islands.  U.S. Army troops and civilian workers alike spent time at \"Blackies\", the only bar in the area. This establishment had cheap beer and 50-cent shots of whiskey, but no stools or chairs as they \"splintered too easily in event of a fight\". Other entertainment included a brothel named \"Pleasure Island\", but this was closed in 1941 and later replaced by part of the U.S. Navy submarine base. The 500-man mess hall doubled as a theater. The tickets for military were 15 cents and 35 cents for civilian workers. In early 1942, intelligence officers of the U.S. Navy predicted that there would be a Japanese attack in the North Pacific area, and naval codebreakers warned Dutch Harbor of the impending attack. On June 3, 1942, at 5:45 a.m., 20 Japanese planes from two aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese navy bombed Dutch Harbor in the \"Battle of Dutch Harbor,\" targeting the radio station and the petroleum storage tanks.  By mid-1942, a small submarine base was in place, with a squadron of old U.S. Navy S-class submarines. By May 1943, a peak of 10,151 sailors and 9,976 soldiers were stationed at the base.  In 1947, the last units of the U.S. Navy left Dutch Harbor and the base was decommissioned.  In 1952, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stored 232 surplus buildings on 448 acres of land of the Fort Mears Military Reservation.  During the mid-1980s, the US government finally funded a cleanup of the derelict fort, and the area was turned over for commercial use. The U. S. Navy also scrapped its air base on it. The harbor is prominently featured in the Discovery Channel reality television series \"Deadliest Catch\", which has been airing there since 2005. Dutch Harbor first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It returned lastly in 1940, and did not appear again separately afterwards. It was later annexed into Unalaska. Dutch Harbor is ranked as a top fishing port with more than a billion dollars transferred each year. Huge harvests of pollock and cod in the Bering Sea are part of this total. The Bering Sea has a continental shelf that is one of the world’s largest, and supports a rich ecosystem.", "Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army\nDutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army The Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears are the two military installations built next to each other in Dutch Harbor, on Amaknak Island of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, by the United States in response to the growing war threat with Imperial Japan. In 1938 the Navy Board recommended the construction which began in July 1940. The first army troops arrived in June 1941 and the navy air base was finished in September 1941. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, these were the only military installations in the Aleutian Islands. Dutch Harbor occupies the central portion of Amaknak Island, a small island in Unalaska Bay which is separated from the larger Unalaska Island by Iliuliuk Bay. The two islands are joined (and were in the 1940s) joined by a bridge connecting the city of Unalaska to the southern portion of Amaknak Island. During World War II the entirety of Amaknak Island was used by the United States Navy as an operating base, and by the United States Army, which manned coastal defenses on the high ground at the northern and southern parts of the island. The central portion of the island was occupied by the facilities of the naval base, which included a runway and other aircraft support facilities, munitions storage facilities, barracks, a hospital, and a bomb-proof power plant. South of the naval base was Fort Mears, (named in tribute to Frederick Mears) which primarily consisted of barracks for the troops manning the coastal defenses. The coastal defenses included batteries placed to the north on Ulakta Head and Mount Ballyhoo, and to the south on what the army called Hill 400, but is now known as Bunker Hill for its surviving structures. On June 3, 1942, the Japanese Navy attacked Dutch Harbor. Originally planned to start at the same time as the battle of Midway, it occurred a day earlier due to one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force. 43 Americans and at least one Japanese died during the attacks, which lasted for two days. The base remained an important part of coastal defenses for the remainder of World War II. Shortly after the end of World War II, the US military abandoned their Dutch Harbor outposts. For decades afterwards, the buildings remained standing, generally abandoned. With the growth of the king crab fishery in the 1970s, many of these buildings were used as warehouses, bunkhouses, and family homes. In the late 1980s, the US government finally funded a cleanup of the derelict fort, and the area was turned over for commercial use."], "neg": ["Delfshaven\nDelfshaven Delfshaven is a borough of Rotterdam on the right bank of river Nieuwe Maas, in South Holland, the Netherlands. It was a separate municipality until 1886. The town of Delfshaven grew around the port of the city of Delft. Delft itself was not located on a major river, so in 1389 a harbour was created about due south of the city, to be able to receive seafaring vessels and avoid tolls being levied by the neighbouring and competing city of Rotterdam. This settlement was named Delfshaven (\"Port of Delft\"). On 1 August 1620 the Pilgrim fathers left Delfshaven with the \"Speedwell\". Since then, the town's Oude Kerk has also been known as the Pelgrimskerk, or in English, the \"Pilgrim Fathers Church\". Fishing, shipbuilding and the distillery of jenever were the main sources of income. The Dutch East India Company had important wharfs and warehouses in Delfshaven, and one of the Dutch West India Company's most famous commanders, Piet Hein, was born here. Delfshaven belonged to the city and municipality of Delft until 1811, when it became a separate municipality. Delfshaven was annexed by Rotterdam in 1886 at its own request. The current borough has about 73,000 inhabitants. Its small historic centre has been carefully preserved. It features modest local museums, a brewery and various dining and drinking facilities. Delfshaven escaped the bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe on May 14, 1940.

{"query": "Spanish Embassy Burning causes and political context instead of survivor accounts", "pos": ["Burning of the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala\nBurning of the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala The Burning of the Spanish Embassy (sometimes called the Spanish Embassy Massacre or the Spanish Embassy Fire) refers to the occupation of the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City, Guatemala, on January 31st, 1980, by indigenous peasants of the Committee for Peasant Unity and their allies and the subsequent police raid that resulted in a fire which destroyed the embassy and left 36 people dead. The incident has been called \"the defining event\" of the Guatemalan Civil War. Spain terminated diplomatic relations with Guatemala as a result. In January 1980 a group of K'iche' and Ixil peasant farmers, recruited for a march to Guatemala City to protest the kidnapping and murder of peasants in Uspantán, in Quiché department, by elements of the Guatemalan Army. The peasants were organized, guided and joined by members of the \"Comité de Unidad Campesina\" (Committee of Peasant Unity) and a radical student organization known as the Robin García Revolutionary Student Front, groups associated with the \"Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres\" (EGP, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor). The protesters were denied a hearing in Congress and their legal adviser was assassinated. On January 28, they briefly took over two radio stations. At 11:05 in the morning on January 31, 1980, the peasants, joined by workers and students, entered the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City. According to police reports, some of the demonstrators were armed with machetes, pistols and Molotov cocktails. Spain was considered sympathetic to the indigenous cause, especially after the Guatemalan Army came to be suspected in the murder of Spanish priests in the indigenous regions. Ambassador Máximo Cajal y López who had visited the Ixil and Kiche regions in the previous weeks, was holding a meeting with former vice president of Guatemala Eduardo Cáceres Lenhoff and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Adolfo Molina Orantes and lawyer Mario Aguirre Godoy, when the group entered the embassy. The protesters announced that they had come to peacefully occupy the embassy and that they would hold a press conference at noon. They presented the ambassador with a letter that read in part, \"We ... direct ourselves to you because we know you are honorable people who will tell the truth about the criminal repression suffered by the peasants of Guatemala.\" In 1978 an occupation of the Swiss Embassy by factory workers in a labour dispute had ended with a peaceful resolution. President Fernando Romeo Lucas García, Guatemala City police chief Germán Chupina Barahona, and Minister of the Interior Donaldo Álvarez Ruiz met in the National Palace. Despite pleas by the Spanish ambassador to negotiate, a decision was taken to forcibly expel the group occupying the embassy. Shortly before noon, and before the protesters could air their grievances, about 300 armed state agents surrounded the building and cut the electricity, water and telephone lines. SWAT police proceeded to occupy the first and third floors of the building over the shouts of the ambassador that they were violating international law in doing so. The peasants barricaded themselves, along with the captive embassy staff and the visiting Guatemalan officials, in the ambassador's office on the second floor. An order was given to charge the ambassador’s office. Police breached the office door and introduced a substance, most likely white phosphorus, which together with the Molotov cocktails ignited a fire. Some academics and critics, including David Stoll and Jorge Palmieri, contend that it was the Molotov cocktails alone that started the blaze. Exactly how the fire started and who is responsible for it has been the subject of considerable polemics. As fire consumed the second floor and the demonstrators and captive staff of the embassy were burned alive, police refused pleas from bystanders to allow firefighters to combat the blaze. A total of 36 people died in the fire, including former vice president Eduardo Cáceres Lenhoff, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Adolfo Molina Orantes and activist Vicente Menchú, father of Rigoberta Menchú, a future politician and Nobel Peace Prize-winner. Spanish Consul Jaime Ruiz del Árbol also died in the fire, along with other Spanish citizens employed by the embassy. Ambassador Cajal y López survived by escaping through a window. The only other survivor, demonstrator Gregorio Yujá Xona, suffered third-degree burns. Both were sent to Herrera Llerandi Hospital for treatment. On February 1, at 7:30 a.m., the police guard at Herrera Llerandi Hospital was withdrawn. Shortly thereafter a band of twenty armed men masked with bandanas, widely believed to be plainclothes members of the Judicial Police, entered the hospital and kidnapped Gregorio Yuja Xona. He was taken to an unknown location, tortured, and shot dead. His body was dumped on the campus of the University of San Carlos. Around his neck was a placard with a note that read \"Brought to Justice for Being a Terrorist\" and \"The Ambassador will be next.\" Ambassador Cajal y López escaped the hospital with the assistance of other members of the diplomatic corps and eventually fled the country. The Guatemalan government issued a statement claiming that its forces had entered the embassy at the request of the Spanish Ambassador, and that the occupiers of the embassy, whom they referred to as \"terrorists,\" had \"sacrificed the hostages and immolated themselves afterward.\" Ambassador Cajal denied the claims of the Guatemalan government and Spain immediately terminated diplomatic relations with Guatemala, calling the action a violation of \"the most elementary norms of international law.\" Relations between Spain and Guatemala were not normalized until September 22, 1984. Hundreds attended the funeral of the victims, and a new guerilla group was formed commemorating the date, the \"Frente patriótico 31 de enero\" (Popular Front of January 31). In 1999, Rigoberta Menchú filed a criminal complaint in Spain accusing former government officials of responsibility for the incident, including former Presidents Romeo Lucas Garcia, Efraín Ríos Montt and Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores. In 2005, a Spanish judge issued an arrest warrant holding former Guatemalan Interior Minister Donaldo Álvarez responsible for the incident. Álvarez was last seen in Mexico and is considered a fugitive. On January 30, 2009, the eve of the 29th anniversary of the incident, the Guatemalan government filed 3,350 criminal complaints alleging human rights violations against former soldiers and paramilitaries.<a href=\"https%3A//www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Jan30/0%2C4675%2CLTGuatemalaWarAtrocities%2C00.html\"></a> On January 20, 2015, former SWAT police chief Pedro García Arredondo was sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder and crimes against humanity, for ordering that no one should be allowed to get out of the burning building alive.

It depicts the famous first game of American intercollegiate football, played by Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) and the visiting College of New Jersey (by then more commonly known as Princeton College) on November 6, 1869, at College Field in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The game was played in front of approximately 100 spectators, including a Rutgers professor who is reported to have waved his umbrella at the participants while yelling, \"You will come to no Christian end!\" Friberg included the man with the umbrella in the painting as a tribute.", "Intercollegiate Football Association\nIntercollegiate Football Association The Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA), also known as the American Intercollegiate Football Association, was one of the earliest college football rules-making and scheduling organizations in existence; it was active from the 1873 to 1893 seasons. The IFA teams, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, are now members of the Ivy League. The 1869 game between Princeton and Rutgers, which has been called the first intercollegiate football game in America, was a version of association football, known in North America as soccer. The rules were based on London's The Football Association and the round ball could not be advanced by carrying or throwing it. The first IFA was founded in 1873 by Princeton, Yale, and Rutgers to adopt common rules to replace the practice of playing under the home team's rules. Harvard refused to attend the founding meeting, preferring to keep the \"Boston game\", a cross between soccer and rugby football. On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the second Intercollegiate Football Association as a result of the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team. This was the first comprehensive effort to organize and standardize American football. This IFA lasted from the 1877 season until 1893. Walter Camp, the \"father of American football\", was instrumental in creating the rules of American football. Camp became a fixture at the annual Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. He proposed a rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs.", "1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game\n1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game The 1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game was a college football game between Fairmount College (now called Wichita State University) and the Washburn Ichabods played on December 25, 1905, in Wichita, Kansas. It marked the first experiment with the forward pass and with the ten-yard requirement for first downs. It is unclear if the game was considered \"regular season\", \"post season\", or \"exhibition\" in classification. Fairmount college was coached by Willis Bates. The head coach for Washburn that season was John H. Outland, but since he was officiating it is likely that the coaching duties fell to assistant coach (and next year's head coach) Garfield Weede. The game ended in a 0–0 tie. The conditions for the game were excellent, but neither side was able to approach the other team's goal except by a punt. Only seven first downs were made the entire game—four by Washburn and three by Fairmount. Most of the game was played in the middle of the field, to the disappointment of the fans. Both teams had played a previous game that same season. What made this second game unique was that it was a test of a proposed rule of play. During the game, each team's offense was required to gain ten yards in three downs instead of four to earn a new first down. The experiment was considered a failure. Football legend John H. Outland officiated the game and commented, \"It seems to me that the distance required in three downs would almost eliminate touchdowns, except through fakes or flukes.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that there was much kicking and that the game was considered much safer than regular play, but that the new rule was not \"conducive to the sport.\" Three days later, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of that meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was formed and several other rule changes were made to improve safety for players, including the addition of the forward pass. In his history of the sport of football, David M. Nelson concluded that \"the first forward passes were thrown at the end of the 1905 season in a game between Fairmount and Washburn colleges in Kansas.\" According to Nelson, Washburn completed three passes, and Fairmount completed two. Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who completed a pass to Art Solter.", "1874 Harvard vs. McGill football game\n1874 Harvard vs. McGill football game The 1874 Harvard vs. McGill football game was the first rugby-style football game played in the United States. The Harvard Crimson played the McGill Redmen on May 15, 1874 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The game used three periods or \"games\" and ended in a scoreless tie. A Princeton vs. Rutgers football game was played five years earlier in 1869, but under a variation of England's Football Association rules closer to contemporary soccer than American football. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on association football than on rugby football, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games. Harvard, which played the \"Boston game\", a version of football that allowed carrying, refused to attend this rules conference and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to a challenge to play McGill University, from Montreal, Canada, in a two-game series. The McGill team traveled to Cambridge to meet Harvard. On May 14, 1874, the first game, played under \"Boston\" rules, was dominated by Harvard, which lead 3–0 after only 22 minutes when the game was ended. The next day, the two teams played under \"McGill\" rugby rules to a scoreless tie. The first game featured a round ball instead of a rugby-style oblong ball. McGill used a bladder covered by leather instead of a rubber ball as did Harvard, which was much more difficult to kick. This series of games represents an important milestone in the development of the modern game of American football. A similar game was played a year later between Harvard and Tufts establishing this as the first game between two American colleges played under rules used in today's version of American football. Harvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the try which, until that time, was not used in American football. The try would later evolve into the score known as the touchdown. In late 1874, the Harvard team traveled to Montreal to play McGill in rugby, and won by three tries in front of 2,000 spectators."], "neg": ["Paper football\nPaper football Paper football (also called FIKI football, finger football, flick football, or tabletop football) refers to a table-top game, loosely based on American football, in which a sheet of paper folded into a small triangle is slid back and forth across a table top by two opponents. This game is widely practiced for entertainment, mostly by students in primary, middle school, and high school age in the United States. Due to the audience and impromptu nature of the game, a paper football is often made out of a single sheet of paper. The paper is folded similar to the way that an American flag is folded to form a triangle. First the paper is folded lengthwise two or three times to form a long rectangle. Then it is repeatedly folded in a diagonal fashion, forming a triangle. Finally, the end of the strip is tucked into the last fold, securing the final paper football in a triangular shape.  In the absence of paper, sugar packets, matchbooks, and foil-wrapped cookies have also been used to substitute for a ball. Many variations of the game exist, but generally paper football games vaguely emulate American football. The two opposing teams (usually two opposing players) sit facing each other over the play area. A coin (or, a specially-marked football) is flipped to see who kicks off to start the game. After the kickoff the teams advance the Ball by flicking it across the field. Each flick represents a drive in American football, with the goal being to score a touchdown. Games may be as simple as flicking the ball back and forth in a fashion similar to \"field goals,\" or as involved as including simulations of events from \"touchbacks\" to \"penalties\" to \"first downs\". A kick off may start the game. The player holds the football under a fingertip of one hand on his end of the table and flicks (kicks) it with a finger from the other hand towards the opposing player's end of the table. The receiving team gets possession where the ball stops. If any part of the ball is overhanging the end of the table a touchback has occurred. The receiving team gets an agreed distance away from their endzone and play continues. There are a couple of other ways to perform the kick off; one is by placing the ball on the edge of the table with one corner overhanging, and flicking it towards the opposing side of the table. Other players use a one-handed type of kick off: the ball is held resting in the palm, then it is tossed onto the table by hitting the fingers on the underside of the table. The method used should be agreed upon before playing. Some play with a \"wind\" rule on kickoffs in which the opposing player can blow the ball backwards as \"wind.\" The primary activity of the game is to slide the paper football across the football field by flicking it. The legal flick or shot or throw is any method which advances the ball through flicking or hitting, but pushing the ball is disallowed. The ball is generally flicked either with the thumb and forefinger in a manner similar to shooting marbles, or another manner comfortable to the player. Striking with objects such as pencils is more rare. Players have four chances (downs) to score a touchdown. They may attempt a field goal on fourth down. A team scores points by the following plays: A touchdown (TD) is worth 6 points, as in American football. A touchdown is scored when a player advances the ball such that it comes to rest with part of the ball extending over the edge the opponent's end of the table without falling to the ground. If the ball falls to the ground it is considered a touchback. If on fourth down a player feels that they are not close enough to have a good chance at scoring a touchdown then they can attempt a field goal for 3. When the players are unsure whether a touchdown has been scored, a flat object can be slid across the edge of the table nearest the ball. If the object moves the ball, a touchdown is ruled. Following a \"touchdown\", the scoring player usually kicks a field goal for 1 point (an \"extra point\" or \"point-after touchdown\"), or has the option to try for 2 points (a \"two-point conversion\"). Play resumes with either a fresh kickoff by the scoring player, or a change of possession, based on house rules. A field goal is any attempt by a player to hold the ball in one hand (which in turn generally rests on the table), and to flick the ball using the other hand such that it travels through a goalpost formed by the fingers of the opposing player. Field goals generally score 3 points. Implementation of \"field goals\" varies widely, and in some variations the game consists entirely of players kicking \"field goals\" back and forth with no other plays in between. If this is the case, each successful field goal is worth only one point. Variations: A safety is worth two points. This occurs when a player scores a touchdown on his/her own end of the table and not his/her opponent's end. The opposing player earns these two points. Pushing the ball excessively, double flicking, kicking the ball so that it lands far away from the table, or disturbing the ball during an opponent's play may all result in penalties depending on game variation. Most often, a penalty moves the ball toward the offender's side of the table, to the opponent's advantage. If players are using \"downs\", the offending player generally loses a down (or the opponent's play is considered not to have used a down), in addition to letting the opposing player move the ball to a more advantageous position. Game length varies. A match may last a set amount of time such as 10 points or until the end of a class period in school. A match is often played until someone attains 21 points. Games are generally played quite quickly, especially when played on shorter tables. Various methods in turn or in combination can be used to break ties. One is \"sudden death\" - if the game is tied in a timed game, the match goes into sudden death, and the player who scores first wins the game.  <br>"]}

{"query": "Cagting barangay history and cultural traditions instead of geographical location and boundaries", "pos": ["Barangay state\nBarangay state In early Philippine history, the barangay was a complex sociopolitical unit which scholars have historically considered the dominant organizational pattern among the various peoples of the Philippine archipelago.  These sociopolitical units were sometimes also referred to as barangay states, but are more properly referred to using the technical term \"polity\", rather than \"state\", so they are usually simply called \"barangays\", but evidence suggests a considerable degree of independence as a type of \"city states\" ruled by datus, rajahs and lakans and sultans. Early chroniclers record that the name evolved from the term \"balangay\", which refers to a plank boat widely used by various cultures of the Philippine archipelago prior to the arrival of European colonizers. Some barangays were well-organized independent villages, consisting of thirty to a hundred households. Other barangays - most notably those in Maynila, Tondo, Panay, Pangasinan, Cebu, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, and Sulu - were integrated into large cosmopolitan polities. Anthropologist F. Landa Jocano defines this period of the barangay states' dominance - approximately the 14th to the 16th centuries - as the \"Barangic Phase\" of early Philippine history. Historical barangays should not be confused with present-day Philippine barrios, which were officially renamed \"barangays\" by the Philippine Local Government Code of 1991 as a reference to historical barangays. Historically, the first barangays started as relatively small communities of around 30 to 100 families, with a population that varies from one hundred to five hundred persons. When the Spaniards came, they found communities with twenty to thirty people only. They also encountered large and prestigious principalities. The coastal villages were more accessible to trade with foreigners. These were ideal places for economic activity to develop. Business with traders from other Countries also meant contact with other cultures and civilizations, such as those of Japan, Han Chinese, Indian people, and Arab people. In time, these coastal communities acquired more advanced cultures, with developed social structures (sovereign principalities), ruled by established royalties and nobilities. The smallest barangays were communities of around 30 to 100 households, led by a Datu, or a leader with an equivalent title. This was the typical size of inland settlements by the time the Spanish colonizers arrived in the late 1500s, whereas larger, more cosmopolitan polities dominated the coasts, particularly river deltas. When barangays grew larger, as was the case in Maynila, Tondo, the Madja-as of Panay, Pangasinan, Cebu, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, and Sulu, among others, they took on a more complex social organization. Several barangays, consisting of households loyal to a datu, Rajah or Sultan banded together to form larger cosmopolitan polities as an apex city states. . The Rulers of these barangays would then select the most senior or most respected among them to serve as a paramount datu. These polities sometimes had other names (such as \"bayan\" in the Tagalog regions) but since the terminology varies from case to case, scholars such as Jocano and Scott simply refer to them as \"larger\" barangays. The titles of the paramount datu also changed from case to case, including: Sultan in the most Islamized areas of Mindanao; Lakan among the Tagalogs; Thimuay Labi among the Subanen; Rajah in polities which traded extensively with Indonesia and Malaysia; or simply Datu in some areas of Mindanao and the Visayas. Often, these Paramount Datus, Rajah's and Sultans formed ritual alliances with the leaders of nearby polities, and these \"alliance groups\" spread their political influence (but \"not\" their territorial claims) across an even larger geographic area. One prominent example was the case of the Paramount Rulers of Maynila and Tondo, who were said to have political sway among the peoples of Bulacan and Pampanga before the arrival of the Spanish. Theories, as well as local oral traditions, say that the original \"barangays\" were coastal settlements formed as a result of the migration of these Malayo-Polynesian people (who came to the archipelago) by boat from other places in Southeast Asia. Most of the ancient barangays were coastal or riverine in nature. This is because most of the people were relying on fishing for supply of protein and for their livelihood. They also travelled mostly by water up and down rivers, and along the coasts. Trails always followed river systems, which were also a major source of water for bathing, washing, and drinking. The barangays in some coastal places in Panay, Manila, Cebu, Jolo, and Butuan, with cosmopolitan cultures and trade relations with other Countries in Asia, were already established Principalities before the coming of the Spaniards. In these regions, even though the majority of these \"barangays\" were not large settlements, yet they had organized societies dominated by the same type of recognized aristocracy (with birthright claim to allegiance from followers), as those found in established Principalities. The aristocratic group in these pre-colonial societies was called the Datu Class. Its members were presumably the descendants of the first settlers on the land or, in the case of later arrivals, of those who were Datus at the time of migration or conquest. Some of these Principalities have remained, even until the present, in unhispanized and mostly Islamized parts of the Philippines, in Mindanao. In more developed barangays in Visayas (e.g. Cebu, Bohol, and Panay) which were never conquered by Spain but were subjugated as vassals by means of pacts, peace treaties, and reciprocal alliances, the \"datu\" was at the top of the social order in a \"sakop\" or \"haop\" (elsewhere referred to as \"barangay\"). This social order was divided into three classes. The members of the \"tumao\" class (which includes the \"datu\") were the nobility of pure royal descent, compared by the Boxer Codex to the titled Spanish lords (\"señores de titulo\"). Below the \"tumao\" were the vassal warrior class known as the \"timawa\", characterized by the Jesuit priest Francisco Ignatio Alcina as \"the third rank of nobility\" and by the conquistador Miguel de Loarca as \"free men, neither chiefs nor slaves\". These were people of lower nobility who were required to render military service to the \"datu\" in hunts, land wars (\"Mangubat\" or \"Managayau\"), or sea raids (\"Mangahat\" or \"Magahat\"). Aside from this, the \"timawa\" also paid taxes and tribute (\"buwis\" or \"handug\") and were sometimes called upon for agricultural labor to the \"datu\", though the personal vassals of the \"datu\" may be exempt from such obligations (the latter were characterized by the Boxer Codex as \"knights and hidalgos). Below the \"timawa\" were the \"oripun\" class (commoners and slaves), who rendered services to the \"tumao\" and \"timawa\" for debts or favors. To maintain purity of bloodline, the \"tumao\" usually marry only among their kind, often seeking high ranking brides in other \"barangay\", abducting them, or contracting brideprices in gold, slaves and jewelry. Meanwhile, the \"datu\" keep their marriageable daughters secluded for protection and prestige. These well-guarded and protected highborn women were called \"binokot\" (literally \"veiled\" or \"swaddled\"), and the \"datu\" of pure descent (at least for four generations) were called \"potli nga datu\" or \"lubus nga datu\". The different type of culture prevalent in Luzon gave a less stable and more complex social structure to the pre-colonial Tagalog barangays of Manila, Pampanga and Laguna. Taking part in a more extensive commerce than those in Visayas, having the influence of Bornean political contacts, and engaging in farming wet rice for a living, the Tagalogs were described by the Spanish Augustinian friar Martin de Rada as more traders than warriors, and possessed distinct religious practices concerning anitos and dambanas. The more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating. A Jesuit priest Francisco Colin made an attempt to give an approximate comparison of it with the Visayan social structure in the middle of the 17th century. The term \"datu\" or \"lakan\", or \"apo\" refers to the chief, but the noble class to which the \"datu\" belonged to was known as the \"maginoo\" class. Any male member of the \"maginoo\" class can become a \"datu\" by personal achievement. The term \"timawa\" referring to freemen came into use in the social structure of the Tagalogs within just twenty years after the coming of the Spaniards. The term, however, was being incorrectly applied to former \"alipin\" (commoner and slave class) who have escaped bondage by payment, favor, or flight. Moreover, the Tagalog \"timawa\" did not have the military prominence of the Visayan \"timawa\". The equivalent warrior class in the Tagalog society was present only in Laguna, and they were known as the \"maharlika\" class. At the bottom of the social hierarchy are the members of the \"alipin\" class. There are two main subclasses of the \"alipin\" class . The \"aliping namamahay\" who owned their own houses and served their masters by paying tribute or working on their fields were the commoners and serfs, while the \"aliping sa gigilid\" who lived in their masters' houses were the servants and slaves. Upon the arrival of the Spanish, smaller ancient barangays were combined to form towns in a resettlement process known as \"Reducción\". The policy coerced inhabitants of several far-flung and scattered barangays to move into an centralized \"cabecera\" (town) where a newly built church was situated. This allowed the Spanish government to control the movement of the indigenous population, to easily facilitate Christianization, to conduct population counts, and to collect tributes. Every barangay within a town was headed by the \"cabeza de barangay\" (barangay chief), who formed part of the \"Principalía\" - the elite ruling class of the municipalities of the Spanish Philippines. This position was inherited from the \"datu\", and came to be known as such during the Spanish regime. The Spanish Monarch ruled each barangay through the \"cabeza\", who also collected taxes (called tribute) from the residents for the Spanish Crown. The word barangay in modern use refers to the smallest administrative division in the Philippines, also known by its former Spanish adopted name, the barrio. This modern context for the use of the term \"barangay\" was adopted during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos when he ordered the replacement of the old barrios and municipal councils. This act was eventually codified under the 1991 Local Government Code. There are a number of distinctions between the modern Barangay or Barrio, and the city-states and independent principalities encountered by the Spanish when they first arrived in 1521 and established relatively permanent settlements in 1574. The most glaring difference would be that the modern entity represents a geographical entity, the pre-colonial barangays represented loyalty to a particular head (datu). Even during the early days of Spanish rule, it was not unusual for people living beside each other to actually belong to different barangays. They owed their loyalty to different Datus. Also, while the modern barangay represents only the smallest administrative unit of government, the barangay of precolonial times was either independent, or belonged to what was only a loose confederation of several barangays, over which the rulers picked among themselves who would be foremost - known as the \"Pangulo\" or Rajah. In most cases, his function was to make decisions which would involve multiple barangays, such as disputes between members of two different barangays. Internally, each datu retained his jurisdiction.", "Barangay\nBarangay A barangay or baranggay ( (abbreviated as Brgy. or Bgy.), formerly referred to as barrio, is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines and is the native Filipino term for a village, district or ward. In metropolitan areas, the term often refers to an inner city neighbourhood, a suburb or a suburban neighborhood. The word \"barangay\" originated from \"balangay\", a kind of boat used by a group of Austronesian peoples when they migrated to the Philippines.  Municipalities and cities in the Philippines are subdivided into barangays, with the exception of the municipalities of Adams in Ilocos Norte and Kalayaan, Palawan which each contain only one barangay. The barangay itself is sometimes informally subdivided into smaller areas called \"purok\" (English: \"zone\"), barangay zones consisting of a cluster of houses, and \"sitios\", which are territorial enclaves—usually rural—far from the barangay center. , there were 42,029 barangays throughout the Philippines. When the first Spaniards arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, they found well-organized independent villages called \"barangays\". The name \"barangay\" originated from \"balangay\", a Malay word meaning \"sailboat\". The first barangays started as relatively small communities of around 50 to 100 families. By the time of contact with Spaniards, many barangays have developed into large communities. The \"encomienda\" of 1604 shows that many affluent and powerful coastal barangays in Sulu, Butuan, Panay, Leyte and Cebu, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Pasig, Laguna, and Cagayan River were flourishing trading centers. Some of these barangays had large populations. In Panay, some barangays had 20,000 inhabitants; in Leyte (Baybay), 15,000 inhabitants; in Cebu, 3,500 residents; in Vitis (Pampanga), 7,000 inhabitants; Pangasinan, 4,000 residents. There were smaller barangays with fewer number of people. But these were generally inland communities; or if they were coastal, they were not located in areas which were good for business pursuits. These smaller barangays had around thirty to one hundred houses only, and the population varies from one hundred to five hundred persons. According to Legazpi, he founded communities with only twenty to thirty people. Traditionally, the original “barangays” were coastal settlements of the migration of these Malayo-Polynesian people (who came to the archipelago) from other places in Southeast Asia (\"see chiefdom\"). Most of the ancient barangays were coastal or riverine in nature. This is because most of the people were relying on fishing for their supply of protein and for their livelihood. They also traveled mostly by water up and down rivers, and along the coasts. Trails always followed river systems, which were also a major source of water for bathing, washing, and drinking. The coastal barangays were more accessible to trade with foreigners. These were ideal places for economic activity to develop. Business with traders from other countries also meant contact with other cultures and civilizations, such as those of Japan, Han Chinese, Indian people, and Arab people. These coastal communities acquired more cosmopolitan cultures, with developed social structures (sovereign principalities), ruled by established royalties and nobilities. During the Spanish rule, through a resettlement policy called the \"Reducción\", smaller scattered barangays were consolidated (and thus, \"reduced\") to form compact towns. Each barangay was headed by the \"cabeza de barangay\" (barangay chief), who formed part of the \"Principalía\" - the elite ruling class of the municipalities of the Spanish Philippines. This position was inherited from the first \"datu\"s, and came to be known as such during the Spanish regime. The Spanish Monarch ruled each barangay through the Cabeza, who also collected taxes (called tribute) from the residents for the Spanish Crown. When the Americans arrived, \"slight changes in the structure of local government was effected\". Later, \"Rural Councils\" with four councilors were created to assist, now renamed \"Barrio Lieutenant\"; it was later renamed \"Barrio Council\", and then \"Barangay Council\". The Spanish term barrio (abbv. \"Bo.\") was used for much of the 20th century until 1974, when President Ferdinand Marcos ordered their renaming to \"barangay\"s. The name survived the 1986 EDSA Revolution, though older people would still use the term \"barrio\". The \"Municipal Council\" was abolished upon transfer of powers to the barangay system. Marcos used to call the barangay part of Philippine participatory democracy, and most of his writings involving the New Society praised the role of \"baranganic democracy\" in nation-building. After the 1986 EDSA Revolution and the drafting of the 1987 Constitution, the Municipal Council was restored, making the barangay the smallest unit of Philippine government. The first barangay elections held under the new constitution was held on March 28, 1989, under Republic Act number 6679. The last barangay elections were held in October 2013. Barangay elections scheduled in October 2017 were postponed following the signing of Republic Act number 10952. The postponement has been criticized by election watchdogs and in both the Philippine Congress and Senate. The Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting considers the postponement a move that would \"only deny the people their rights to choose their leaders.\" The modern barangay is headed by elected officials, the topmost being the \"Punong Barangay\" or the Barangay Chairperson (addressed as \"Kapitan\"; also known as the Barangay Captain). The \"Kapitan\" is aided by the \"Sangguniang Barangay\" (Barangay Council) whose members, called \"Barangay Kagawad\" (\"Councilors\"), are also elected. The council is considered to be a Local Government Unit (LGU), similar to the Provincial and the Municipal Government. The officials that make up the council are the \"Punong Barangay\", seven Barangay Councilors, and the chairman of Youth Council or \"Sangguniang Kabataan\" (SK). Thus, there are eight (8) members of the Legislative Council in a barangay. The council if in session for a new solution or a resolution of a bill votes, and if the counsels and the SK are at tie decision, the Captain uses his/her vote. This only happens when the SK which is sometimes stopped and continued. In absence of an SK, the council votes for a nominated Barrio Council President, this president is not like the League of the Barangay Councilors which composes of barangay Captains of a municipality. The Barangay Justice System or \"Katarungang Pambarangay\" is composed of members commonly known as \"Lupon Tagapamayapa\" (Justice of the peace). Their function is to conciliate and mediate disputes at the Barangay level so as to avoid legal action and relieve the courts of docket congestion. Barangay elections are non-partisan and are typically hotly contested. Barangay Captain are elected by first-past-the-post plurality (no runoff voting). Councilors are elected by plurality-at-large voting with the entire barangay as a single at-large district. Each voter can vote up to seven candidates for councilor, with the winners being the seven candidates with the most number of votes. Typically, a ticket usually consists of one candidate for Barangay Captain and seven candidates for the Councilors. Elections for the post of \"Punong Barangay\" and \"barangay kagawads\" are usually held every three years starting from 2007. The barangay is often governed from its seat of local government, the barangay hall. A \"tanod\", or barangay police officer, is an unarmed watchman who fulfills policing functions within the barangay. The number of barangay tanods differ from one barangay to another; they help maintain law and order in the neighborhoods throughout the Philippines. Funding for the barangay comes from their share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) with a portion of the allotment set aside for the \"Sangguniang Kabataan\". The exact amount of money is determined by a formula combining the barangay's population and land area.

The name \"Labayug\" comes from the combined words \"labba\" and \"bayug\", two types of wood used to create rattan-like products. It is considered as one of the five urban barangays in the township of Sison. According to the old folks of the community the first settlers in this part of the country are a group of people called “BAGO TRIBE”. This tribe was said to have originated from the “Amburayan River” found in the province of Ilocos Sur. The Bago’s are crossbreeds of the different mountain tribes and lowlanders. The population is multi-cultured, but the Bago’s are peaceful and hardworking Tribe, composed the greatest number of its inhabitants. Labayug was once a backward community populated by the Kalanguya Tribe, one of the mountain Tribes. It derived its present name from the famous couple, well loved by its inhabitants, and the last known Igorot Leader and Chieftain “Kapitan Bayog” and his wife Labaan. Decades later, the Kalanguya tribes men were driven up into the mountains by the migrating Bago Tribes from the Ilocos Region, hence the predominant Bago inhabitants. The name Labayug, However remained in the memory of the Kalanguya leader Kapitan Bayog and his wife Labaan. Its land area is 3.30 km making it the 8th largest barangay out of 28 barangays. It is surrounded by the following barangays: Immalog, Calunetan, Sugcong. According to the latest census by the Record of Barangay Inhabitants taken in 2013, Labayug has around 3,716 people. Labayug is divided into seven puroks. Each purok is headed by a barangay kagawad, respectively. The barangay fiesta of Labayug mostly occurs during the third week of January. Income from the barangay fiesta goes towards the improvement of the barangay, or its schools. Labayug has its own elementary (primary) and high school (secondary), namely Labayug Elementary School and Labayug National High School, respectively."]}

The idea was to bypass heavily fortified Japanese positions and instead concentrate the limited Allied resources on strategically important islands that were not well defended but capable of supporting the drive to the main islands of Japan. By the late 19th century, the U.S. had several interests in the western Pacific to defend; namely, access to the Chinese market, and its colonies – the Philippines and Guam – which the U.S. had gained as a result of the Spanish–American War (1898). After Japan's victories in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, the U.S. began to regard Japan as a potential threat to its interests in the western Pacific. This antagonism was intensified by Japan's objections to an attempt to annex Hawaii to the U.S. (1893) and by Japan's objections to discrimination against Japanese immigrants both in Hawaii (1897) – on this occasion, Japan sent the cruiser \"Naniwa\" to Honolulu, Hawaii – and in California (1906, 1913). As a result, the U.S. Navy began to draft, as early as 1897, war plans against Japan, which were eventually code-named \"War Plan Orange\". The war plan of 1911, which was drafted under Rear Admiral Raymond P. Rodgers, included an island-hopping strategy for approaching Japan. After World War I, the Versailles Treaty gave Japan a mandate over former German colonies in the western Pacific; specifically, the Mariana, Marshall, and Caroline Islands. If these islands were fortified, Japan could, in principle, deny the U.S. access to its interests in the western Pacific. Therefore, in 1921, Major Earl Hancock Ellis of the U.S. Marine Corps drafted \"Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia,\" a plan for war against Japan which updated War Plan Orange by incorporating modern military technology (submarines, aircraft, etc.) and which again included an island-hopping strategy. Shortly afterwards, a British reporter on naval affairs, Hector Charles Bywater, publicized the prospect of a Japanese-American war in his books \"Seapower in the Pacific\" (1921) and \"The Great Pacific War\" (1925), which detailed an island-hopping strategy. The books were read not only by Americans but by senior officers of the Japanese Imperial Navy, who used \"island-hopping\" in their successful southeast Asia offensives in 1941 and 1942. This strategy was possible in part because the Allies used submarine and air attacks to blockade and isolate Japanese bases, weakening their garrisons and reducing the Japanese ability to resupply and reinforce them. Thus troops on islands which had been bypassed, such as the major base at Rabaul, were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to \"wither on the vine\". General Douglas MacArthur greatly supported this strategy in his effort to regain the Philippines from Japanese occupation. This strategy began to be implemented in late 1943 in Operation Cartwheel. While MacArthur claimed to have invented the strategy, it initially came out of the Navy. Leapfrogging would allow the United States forces to reach Japan quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. It would give the Allies the advantage of surprise and keep the Japanese off balance. The overall leapfrogging strategy would involve two prongs. A force led by Admiral Chester Nimitz, with a smaller land force and larger fleet, would advance north towards the island and capture the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Marianas, going generally in the direction of the Bonin Islands. The southern prong, led by General MacArthur and with larger land forces, would take the Solomons, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, advancing toward the Philippines. The principle of leapfrogging was not always followed in the Pacific. When MacArthur moved south to attack Mindanao after capturing the northern Philippines, and when he instigated the reconquest of portions of Borneo, he violated the \"basic tenets\" of island hopping. In the first case, this may have been motivated by MacArthur's promise to return to the people of the Philippines as soon as possible.", "Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)\nPhilippines Campaign (1944–1945) The Philippines Campaign, the Battle of the Philippines or the Liberation of the Philippines (Filipino: \"Kampanya sa Pilipinas\", \"Labanan sa Pilipinas\" & \"Liberasyon ng Pilipinas\"), (Operation Musketeer I, II, and III) (Filipino: Operasyon \"Mosketero I\", \"II\", \"at\" \"III\"), was the American and Filipino campaign to defeat and expel the Imperial Japanese forces occupying the Philippines during World War II. The Japanese Army overran all of the Philippines during the first half of 1942. The liberation of the Philippines commenced with amphibious landings on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte on October 20, 1944. United States and Philippine Commonwealth military forces were progressing in liberating territory and islands when the Japanese forces in the Philippines were ordered to surrender by Tokyo on August 15, 1945, after the dropping of the atomic bombs on mainland Japan and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. By mid-1944, American forces were only southeast of Mindanao, the largest island in the southern Philippines – and able to bomb Japanese positions there using long-range bombers. American forces under Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz had advanced across the Central Pacific Ocean, capturing the Gilbert Islands, some of the Marshall Islands, and most of the Marianas Islands, bypassing many Japanese Army garrisons and leaving them behind, with no source of supplies and militarily impotent. Aircraft carrier-based warplanes were already conducting air strikes and fighter sweeps against the Japanese in the Philippines, especially their military airfields. U.S. Army and Australian Army troops under the American General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Theater of Operations, had either overrun, or else isolated and bypassed, all of the Japanese Army on New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. Before the invasion of the Philippines, MacArthur's northernmost conquest had been at Morotai in the Dutch East Indies on September 15–16, 1944. This was MacArthur's one base that was within bomber range of the southern Philippines. U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Army as well as Australian and New Zealand forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. had isolated the large Japanese South Pacific base at Rabaul, New Britain, by capturing a ring of islands around Rabaul, and then building air bases on them from which to bomb and blockade the Japanese forces at Rabaul into military impotence. With victories in the Marianas campaign (on Saipan, on Guam, and on Tinian, during June and July 1944), American forces were getting close to Japan itself. From the Marianas, the very long-range B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) could bomb the Japanese home islands from well-supplied air bases – ones with direct access to supplies via cargo ships and tankers. (The earlier B-29 bombing campaign against Japan had been from the end of a very long and tortuous supply line via British India and British Burma – one that proved to be woefully inadequate. All B-29s were transferred to the Marianas during the fall of 1944.) Although Japan was obviously losing the war, the Japanese Government, and the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, showed no sign of capitulation, collapse or surrender. There had been a close relationship between the people of the Philippines and the United States since 1898, with the Philippines becoming the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935, and promised their independence in mid-1946. Furthermore, an extensive series of air attacks by the American Fast Carrier Task Force under Admiral William F. Halsey against Japanese airfields and other bases on the Philippines had drawn little Japanese opposition, such as interceptions by Japanese Army fighter planes. Upon Admiral Halsey's recommendation, the Combined Chiefs of Staff, meeting in Canada, approved a decision to not only move up the date for the first landing in the Philippines, but also to move it north from the southernmost island of Mindanao to the central island of Leyte, Philippines. The new date set for the landing on Leyte, October 20, 1944, was two months before the previous target date to land on Mindanao. The Filipino people were ready and waiting for the invasion. After General MacArthur had been evacuated from the Philippines in March 1942, all of its islands fell to the Japanese. The Japanese occupation was harsh, accompanied by atrocities and with large numbers of Filipinos pressed into slave labor. From mid-1942 through mid-1944, MacArthur and Nimitz supplied and encouraged the Filipino guerrilla resistance by U.S. Navy submarines and a few parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas – amounting to about half of the archipelago. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence. The Australian government offered General MacArthur the use of the First Corps of the Australian Army for the Liberation of the Philippines. MacArthur suggested that two Australian infantry divisions be employed, each of them attached to a different U.S. Army Corps, but this idea was not acceptable to the Australian Cabinet, which wanted to have significant operational control within a certain area of the Philippines, rather than simply being part of a U.S. Army Corps. No agreement was ever reached between the Australian Cabinet and MacArthur – who might have wanted it that way. As a result, the Australian Army played virtually no part in the Philippines. However, units from the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy, such as the heavy cruiser , were involved. During the American re-conquest of the Philippines, the guerrillas began to strike openly against Japanese forces, carried out reconnaissance activities ahead of the advancing regular troops, and took their places in battle beside the advancing American divisions. On October 20, 1944, the U.S. Sixth Army, supported by naval and air bombardment, landed on the favorable eastern shore of Leyte, one of the islands of the Visayas island group, northeast of Mindanao. The Japanese miscalculated the relative strength of the naval and air forces, and they attempted to destroy the landing. This brought about the massive sequence of battles called the Battle of Leyte Gulf, fought on October 23 through October 26. This decisive victory by the U.S. Navy, its Fast Carrier Task Force, its surface fleet, and its submarines effectively destroyed the remainder of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which had already lost all of its effective aircraft carrier forces. The IJN had four of its carriers sunk (ships with depleted air squadrons – which were used only as decoys), numerous battleships and heavy cruisers, and a large number of light cruisers and destroyers. The IJN was never able to fight a major battle after this. The U.S. Sixth Army continued its advance from the east, as the Japanese rushed reinforcements to the Ormoc Bay area on the western side of the island. While the Sixth Army was continually reinforced, the U.S. Fifth Air Force was able to devastate the Japanese attempts at air attacks, and also provide much support to the Army's ground troops. The Filipino guerrillas also performed valuable service in maintaining public order and in keeping the roads and highways free of congestion. After the American beachheads were established, the Leyte guerrilla groups were attached directly to the Sixth Army corps and divisions to assist in scouting, intelligence, and combat operations. With the initial U.S. Sixth Army landings on the beaches at Tacloban and Dulag, Colonel Ruperto Kangleon's units went into action. They dynamited key bridges to block Japanese displacement toward the target area; they harassed enemy patrols; and they sabotaged supply and ammunition depots. Information on enemy troop movements and dispositions sent from guerrilla outposts to Kangleon's Headquarters was dispatched immediately to Sixth Army. During many torrential rains and over difficult terrain, the advance continued across Leyte and onto the major island of Samar, just north of Leyte. On December 7, 1944, the U.S. Army units made another amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay and, after a major land and air battle, the landing force cut off all Japanese ability to reinforce and resupply their troops on Leyte. Although fierce fighting continued on Leyte for months, the U.S. Army was always in control. The U.S. 6th Army's second major target to attack was Mindoro. This large island is directly south of Luzon and Manila Bay, and MacArthur's main goal in taking it was to be able to construct airfields on it for fighter planes that could dominate the sky over the most-important island of Luzon, with its major seaport and capital city of Manila. The Seventh Fleet's large invasion convoy from Leyte to Mindoro came under strong attack by kamikazes, but they could not delay the American invasion of Mindoro. Mindoro was only lightly occupied by the Japanese Army, and much of it was held by Filipino guerrillas, so Mindoro was quickly overrun. U.S. Army engineers set about rapidly constructing a major air base at San Fabian. Besides being close to Luzon, Mindoro has another advantage: good flying weather nearly all the time, because this is a part of the Philippines that is relatively dry – quite unlike Leyte which receives torrential rains most of the year, not only giving it poor flying weather, but making it very muddy and difficult to construct airfields. San Fabian was also the location of another breakthrough: the first appearance during the War in the Pacific of USAAF squadrons flying the fast, long-range P-51B Mustang fighters – far superior to anything that the Imperial Japanese Army or Navy had. Mindoro was a major victory for the 6th Army and the USAAF, and it also provided the major base for the next move of MacArthur's 6th Army: the invasion of Luzon, especially at Lingayen Gulf on its western coast. On December 15, 1944, landings against minimal resistance were made on the southern beaches of the island of Mindoro, a key location in the planned Lingayen Gulf operations, in support of major landings scheduled on Luzon. On January 9, 1945, on the south shore of Lingayen Gulf on the western coast of Luzon, General Krueger's Sixth Army landed his first units. Almost 175,000 men followed across the twenty-mile (32 km) beachhead within a few days. With heavy air support, Army units pushed inland, taking Clark Field, northwest of Manila, in the last week of January. Two more major landings followed, one to cut off the Bataan Peninsula, and another, which included a parachute drop, south of Manila. Pincers closed on the city. On February 3, 1945, elements of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila, and the 8th Cavalry Regiment (organized as infantry) passed through the northern suburbs and into the city itself. As the advance on Manila continued from the north and the south, the Bataan Peninsula was rapidly secured. On February 16, paratroopers and amphibious units simultaneously assaulted the islet of Corregidor. Taking this stronghold was necessary because troops there could block the entrance of Manila Bay. The Americans needed to establish a major harbor base at Manila Bay to support the expected invasion of Japan, planned to begin on November 1, 1945. Resistance on Corregidor ended on February 27, and then all resistance by the Japanese Empire ceased on August 15, 1945, obviating the need for an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. Despite initial optimism, fighting in Manila was harsh. It took until March 3 to clear the city of all Japanese troops, and the Japanese Marines, who fought on stubbornly and refused to either surrender or to evacuate as the Japanese Army had done. Fort Drum, a fortified island in Manila Bay near Corregidor, held out until April 13, when a team of Army troops went ashore and pumped 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the fort, then set off incendiary charges. No Japanese soldiers in Fort Drum survived the blast and fire. In all, ten U.S. divisions and five independent regiments battled on Luzon, making it the largest American campaign of the Pacific war, involving more troops than the United States had used in North Africa, Italy, or southern France. Palawan Island, between Borneo and Mindoro, the fifth largest and western-most island of the Philippines, was invaded on February 28, with landings of the Eighth United States Army at Puerto Princesa. The Japanese put up little direct defense of Palawan, but cleaning up pockets of Japanese resistance lasted until late April, with the Japanese using their common tactic of withdrawing into the mountains and jungles, dispersed as small units. Throughout the Philippines, U.S. forces were aided by Filipino guerrillas to find and dispatch the holdouts, the last of whom, Hiroo Onoda, did not surrender until 1974, in the mountains of Lubang Island in Mindoro. The U.S. Eighth Army then moved on to its first landing on Mindanao (April 17), the last of the major islands of the Philippines to be taken. Mindanao was followed by invasion and occupation of Panay, Cebu, Negros and several islands in the Sulu Archipelago. These islands provided bases for the U.S. Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces to attack targets throughout the Philippines and the South China Sea. Following additional landings on Mindanao, U.S. Eighth Army troops continued their steady advance against stubborn resistance. By the end of June, the enemy pockets were compressed into isolated pockets on Mindanao and Luzon where fighting continued until the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945. However, some units of the Japanese Army were out of radio contact with Tokyo, and it was difficult to convince some of them that Japan had surrendered. As at many Pacific Islands, major Japanese officials, including members of the Imperial Family, visited in person to convince the soldiers that they must surrender by order of the Emperor.", "Operation Kita\nOperation Kita Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, which were designated the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies of oil and other important raw materials. This formed part of an effort to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route. The Completion Force sailed on 10 February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a Royal Navy submarine. However, attempts by it and several United States Navy submarines to attack between 11 and 14 February were unsuccessful. More than 88 USAAF aircraft attempted to bomb the Completion Force on 13 and 14 February, but were unable to do so because of bad weather. A further submarine attack on 16 February did not damage any of the Japanese ships. As a result, the Completion Force reached its destination of Kure in Japan on 20 February without having suffered any casualties. Despite this success, the Japanese Government was forced to discontinue its efforts to ship oil from Southeast Asia to Japan in March due to the heavy losses Allied submarines were inflicting on oil tankers, and all the ships of the Completion Force were sunk in or near Japanese home waters before the end of the war. During 1944, Allied submarine attacks effectively cut off the supply of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By this stage of the war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S. Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan. On 11 November 1944, the two \"Ise\"-class hybrid battleship-aircraft carriers— and , which were grouped as Carrier Division 4 and under the command of Rear Admiral Matsuda Chiaki—sailed from the Japanese home islands to join the main body of the IJN in the Southwest Pacific. This deployment was made to both reinforce the remaining elements of the IJN in the area and place the ships near a source of fuel. During their voyage from Japan, each of the battleship-carriers was loaded with about of munitions for the units defending Manila in the Philippines. Due to heavy Allied air attacks on Manila, the two warships unloaded their supplies in the Spratly Islands from 14 November. They sailed for Lingga Roads near Singapore on the 20th of the month and arrived there two days later. The Allies learned from intelligence gained by decrypting Japanese radio signals that the battleship-carriers had sailed. Allied submarines were ordered to keep watch for the ships, but did not intercept \"Ise\" or \"Hyūga\" during their voyage to Singapore. The two battleship-carriers were deployed to Cam Ranh Bay in Indochina during December and returned to Singapore on 11 January 1945. The U.S. Third Fleet raided the South China Sea between 10 and 20 January in search of the Japanese fleet, but did not locate \"Ise\" or \"Hyūga\". In early February 1945, \"Ise\", \"Hyūga\" and an escort of smaller warships received orders to sail to Japan in what was designated Operation \"Kita\". The goal of this operation was to return some of the IJN warships in the Southwest Pacific to Japan loaded with important supplies. The ships selected to accompany the battleship-carriers were the light cruiser (which became part of Carrier Division 4 from 10 February) and destroyers , and . Carrier Division 4 and its escorts was designated the Completion Force. The ships of the Completion Force departed the Lingga Roads on 6 February and began loading their cargoes in Singapore the next day. Shortly before docking, \"Ise\" sustained a small amount of damage when she struck a mine which had been dropped by Allied aircraft. During the Completion Force's period at Singapore all six ships were loaded with supplies and \"Ise\" received temporary repairs. \"Hyūga\" embarked 4,944 drums of aviation gasoline as well as 326 drums of standard gasoline and 440 oil field workers. \"Ise\" was loaded with 5,200 drums of aviation gasoline and 551 oil workers; each of the battleship-carriers also embarked of rubber, 1,750 short tons of tin and of other metals. \"Ōyodo\" was loaded with of tin, of tungsten, 70 tons of aviation gasoline, of rubber, of zinc and of mercury. A further of rubber and tin was split among the three destroyers. Through code breaking, Allied intelligence was aware of the Completion Force's composition and objectives. Allied signals intelligence units carefully monitored radio transmissions in the Singapore region, and the resulting \"Ultra\" intelligence provided details of the two battleship-carriers' movements to Singapore, preparations to return to Japan and planned route. The commander of Allied submarines in the South-West Pacific Area (Task Force 71), Rear Admiral James Fife, Jr., placed a high priority on stopping \"Ise\" and \"Hyūga\" from reaching Japan, and stationed 15 submarines along their expected route. A plan for coordinated attacks on the ships by the U.S. Navy and USAAF was developed. At the time, the U.S. Seventh Fleet was assigned four battleships in Filipino waters to guard the Allied beachhead at Lingayen Gulf in Luzon against attacks by the Japanese forces based at Lingga Roads and the Inland Sea until the USAAF forces in the region were strong enough to assume this responsibility. As of early February, the USAAF units in the Philippines were focused on supporting the United States Army–led Philippines Campaign and attacking Japanese facilities in Formosa. An intensive campaign against Japanese shipping in the South China Sea had been planned, but was yet to begin. The Completion Force sailed from Singapore on the evening of 10 February. The timing of its departure was set by a long-term forecast of bad weather for the voyage to Japan. The British submarine observed the ships leaving port and attempted to attack them on 11 February, but was driven off by a Japanese aircraft. Following this action, \"Tantalus\" radioed a contact report to Fife's headquarters. The four U.S. Navy battleships at Lingayen Gulf sailed on 10 February bound for U.S. bases in the Pacific where they were to receive repairs and undertake preparations ahead of their role supporting the invasion of Okinawa. The ships left the Philippines area on 14 February without having played any part in efforts to intercept the Completion Force. U.S. Navy submarines unsuccessfully attempted to attack the Japanese ships on 12 February. At about 1:45 pm, detected the Completion Force at a distance of using her radar and transmitted a contact report. An hour later, made radar contact with the Japanese ships at a range of . Over the next 14 hours the submarines \"Blackfin\", \"Charr\", , and attempted to reach a position where they could attack the Japanese ships, but were unable to do so. A group of submarines to the north—comprising , and —was unable to reach a position where they could attack the Completion Force. USAAF patrols made contact with the Completion Force on 12 February; following this, it was tracked almost continuously by radar-equipped Army Air Forces and U.S. Navy aircraft. On the morning of 13 February, a force of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and 40 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers escorted by 48 P-51 Mustang fighters was dispatched from several bases on the islands of Leyte and Mindoro to attack the Japanese ships. While the aircraft successfully rendezvoused near the Completion Force, heavy cloud cover kept them from spotting any of the ships. As radar-directed blind bombing was prohibited to avoid accidental attacks on the Allied submarines in the area, the strike force returned to its bases without attacking. On the same day, the Australian destroyers and departed Lingayen Gulf and proceeded to a position about west of Manila where they were held in readiness to rescue the crews of any aircraft downed while attacking the Completion Force. More submarines attempted to attack the Japanese force on 13 February. A group of three boats—comprising , and —was deployed along its route, and \"Bergall\" sighted the Japanese ships at 12:30 pm. The submarine was submerged at the time and attempted to maneuver into a firing position, but could not get any closer to the ships than . Nevertheless, it fired six torpedoes at the Japanese force, all of which missed. \"Blower\" attempted a submerged attack, but the five torpedoes it fired at one of the battleship-carriers and \"Ōyodo\" missed. and , the northernmost submarines that Rear Admiral Fife had deployed, encountered the Completion Force during the afternoon of 13 February. \"Bashaw\" sighted the Japanese ships as they emerged from a rain squall at 3:15 pm, but one of the battleship-carriers spotted the submarine and launched an aircraft to attack it. \"Bashaw\" was forced to dive when the battleship-carrier began shelling it with her main battery, and neither it nor \"Flasher\" was able to intercept the Completion Force. During this period the other submarines in the area continued to chase the Japanese ships but did not regain contact with them. An air attack was attempted against the Completion Force on 14 February. The number of B-24s, B-25s and escorting P-51s dispatched on this day was smaller than the force which had been used on 13 February, as the Japanese ships were now beyond the range of aircraft based at Leyte. Once again, cloud cover over the Completion Force prevented the Allied aircraft from sighting the Japanese ships, and they were unable to attack due to the prohibition on radar-aimed bombing. This was the USAAF's last attempt to bomb the Japanese force. As a result, the only successes gained by the USAAF aircraft involved in the operation were to shoot down a Mitsubishi Ki-57 \"Topsy\" transport plane near the Completion Force on 13 February as well as several fighters in the area of the ships between the 12th and 14th of the month. The two Australian destroyers were released for other duties on 15 February. Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood—the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's submarine force—followed the unsuccessful attempts to intercept the Completion Force in the South China Sea, and stationed a further eleven submarines along its projected route between the Luzon Strait and Japan. The Completion Force reached the Matsu Islands at the northern end of the Formosa Strait in the evening of 15 February, and anchored there for five hours. The Japanese ships resumed their journey to Kure via Korea and the Shimonoseki Strait at midnight, and the destroyers and were attached to the force for part of the day. At 5:07 am on 16 February, intercepted the Completion Force south of the Chinese city of Wenchow and fired six torpedoes at one of the escorts, but all missed. At this time the Japanese ships were sailing at a speed of . None of the other American submarines made contact with the Japanese force as it sailed to the east of where they had been positioned by Lockwood. The Completion Force finished its entire voyage in about 10 days; after slipping the Allied patrols it anchored off Chusan Island near Shanghai from 9:06 pm on 16 February until 7:00 am on 18 February, when it sailed for Sanzenpo Harbor near Sacheon on the southern coast of Korea. It arrived there at 4:00 pm that day, and anchored overnight. The Completion Force departed Sanzenpo Harbor at 7:00 am on 19 February and reached the Japanese island of Mutsurejima at 4:00 pm that day. After anchoring overnight, the Completion Force docked at Kure at 10:00 am on 20 February. The ships of the Completion Force were among the last Japanese warships to reach the home islands from the Southwest Pacific. The Allied naval commanders were disappointed by the failure of the 26 submarines directed against the Completion Force to inflict any damage on the ships. Fife concluded that this was due to the Completion Force's high speed, the poor weather conditions at the time of the operation and the Japanese ships being fitted with equipment that enabled them to detect submarines' radar signals. In a letter to Lockwood, he wrote that the failure of the submarines under his command \"was a bitter pill to take and I make no alibi\". Lockwood attributed the decision to deploy his submarines too far to the west on faulty intelligence, and told Fife that \"our dope certainly went sour at the last moment. Perhaps I depended too much on it\". The use of freighters and warships to carry oil was successful in increasing Japanese oil imports, and the total level quality of oil which reached the country during the first quarter of 1945 was greater than the amounts achieved in late 1944. Nevertheless, Allied submarines sank the majority of the merchant tankers that attempted to sail from Southeast Asia to Japan during February, and in March the Japanese ceased attempting to import oil from this source. Following the departure of the Completion Force, the only major seaworthy Japanese warships remaining in the Southwest Pacific were the heavy cruisers and as well as the light cruiser . These three cruisers did not attempt to return to Japan, and all were sunk by Allied submarines and destroyers between April and June. After reaching Japan, \"Ise\" and \"Hyūga\" were assigned to bolster the anti-aircraft defenses of the city of Kure and its naval base. Due to shortages of fuel and aircraft, the ships did not put to sea again, and both were sunk during the U.S. Navy's attacks on Kure between 24 and 28 July 1945. \"Ōyodo\" became part of the Kure Training Force and remained in port until she was sunk on 28 July. The three destroyers also failed to survive the war; \"Asashimo\" and \"Kasumi\" fell victim to American carrier aircraft while escorting the battleship during Operation \"Ten-Go\" on 6 April, and \"Hatsushimo\" sank after striking a mine near Maizuru on 30 July."], "neg": ["Creeping attack\nCreeping attack The creeping attack was an anti submarine measure developed during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. It was first used by 36 Escort Group of the Royal Navy after being developed by the Group's commanding officer, Captain \"Johnnie\" Walker. The problem addressed by Walker in the tactics then in use was that ASDIC, the means to search for and find a submerged submarine, searched forward, while the main weapon to attack it, the depth charge, was released or projected from the stern.  This led to a loss of contact in final run up to target, giving the U-boat a chance to move at the last minute and evade damage. The more skilled or experienced U-boat commanders became adept at predicting the points at which the escort sped up to attack, and when they lost ASDIC contact, and were able to move aside while the charges sank to their depth. The creeping attack used two ships; one to remain stationary and keep in contact, and guide a second ship onto the target. The second approached slowly, in order not to warn the U-boat of its approach, and released its depth charges on a signal from the first. The method required practice to get right, and was expensive of time and resources, but was devastatingly effective. 36 EG, and Walker's next group, 2nd Support Group, were the most successful U-boat killers of the war. The advent of more sophisticated ASDIC systems, that held contact close in, and forward-throwing weapons, such as Hedgehog and Squid, also overcame the problems that made the creeping attack necessary, but it remained in use throughout the campaign."]}

The Abalakov thread is a common method of protecting oneself while ice climbing because it is easy to create, doesn't require the sacrifice of expensive gear, and can be very safe when used properly. An Abalakov thread is often used in multi-pitch ice climbing routes. Because of its safety and convenience, the Abalakov thread is considered one of the most significant innovations in ice climbing. It significantly expanded the scope of possible routes and abseiling safety. An Abalakov thread can be constructed using an ice screw, of appropriate strength cord, and hook-like Abalakov threading device. Two holes are drilled in the ice, which interconnect at the ends to form a v-like channel in the ice. The cord is then threaded through this hole, and tied with a knot such as a fisherman's knot. This loop is then used to hang the abseiling rope. Abalakov thread can only be constructed in solid ice. The holes need to be drilled at the correct angle (about 45-50 degrees compared to ice surface), and care must be taken that they interconnect. The surfaces of the holes need to have sufficient distance (about ) between them. If the ice is not strong enough, it is possible to use two Abalakovs to balance the force, although if this is needed, an alternate route is strongly recommended. A 2009 finding and experiments have shown that a vertical rather than horizontal arrangement of the holes to be stronger (12%) (Smith, 2009). This configuration has been termed the A thread. Though the Abalakov thread is considered to be as strong as any ice screw placement, a backup ice screw is frequently used for the first abseil. This allows for increased safety if mistakes were made in the creation of the Abalakov thread, and allows the strength of the thread to be observed."], "neg": ["Steam locomotives of the 21st century\nSteam locomotives of the 21st century Steam locomotives of the 21st century fall into two broad categories: those that use advanced steam technology and are designed to be commercially competitive with diesel locomotives; and those built to more traditional designs for hauling tourist trains.

The plant is operated by Vistra Energy, a subsidiary of Luminant. It began operations in 2009. Plans for Oak Grove began in the 1970s as Texas Power & Light (a forerunner of Luminant) and Alcoa made an agreement to jointly operate a power plant named Twin Oak Steam Electric Station in Robertson County. The plan was to construct two, 750 MW units to burn lignite and be ready for commercial generation by 1981. The electricity generated would run to Alcoa's aluminium smelting facility in Palestine, Texas. Twin Oaks Reservoir was developed by impounding Duck Creek in 1982 to act as a cooling source for the plant. In 1983, Alcoa attempted to sell its stake in Twin Oak to Halliburton who was seeking electricity to offer to the owners of the troubled South Texas Nuclear Generating Station. Ultimately, Alcoa sold its stake back to Texas Utilities in 1984. As electricity demand in Texas stagnated, construction on Twin Oak continued to be deferred until the air permit was withdrawn in 1994.

The plant will become a museam after a seismic refit of the building. The Olmsted Station Power House was built in 1904, by L. L. Nunn and his brother and chief engineer, P. N. Nunn. The plant received its name in honor of Fay Devaux Olmsted, who played a key role in helping the Nunn brothers design the plant, contracted and died from Tuberculosis before the plant was completed. The plant, when running at full capacity, was able to provide twelve megawatts of power, which is enough for about three thousand homes. Along with the Power station, these men established an institute, known as the Telluride Institute, which was home to approximately forty students. This institute was the first corporation sponsored electrical school in the U.S. and continued to operate until 1912 when Utah Power and Light Company attained the property. In order to harvest the power of falling water, new technology needed to be invented. To facilitate this, the Nunn brothers worked with George Westinghouse, hoping he would be able to use falling water to power transformers, switches, and water powered generators. The Nunn brothers provided Westinghouse with a pouch of gold worth fifty thousand dollars, and eventually, the technology was available so that the plant could be built and become an efficient energy source. The Olmsted power station was decommissioned in 2015.

Its main purpose is to provide women with opportunities for pleasant social interaction, both for reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. There are more than 50,000 members in the United States and 30 other countries. In the fall of 1997, Sue Ellen Cooper, an artist from Fullerton, California, purchased an old red fedora for $7.50 from a thrift shop during a trip to Tucson, Arizona. When a good friend was nearing a 55th birthday, Cooper cast about for an idea for an original gift. Inspired by a well-known Jenny Joseph poem, \"Warning\", which begins “When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple, with a red hat which doesn't go and doesn't suit me.” Cooper wanted to encourage her friend to grow older in a playful manner. She gave her friend a red hat of her own suggesting that she keep it as a reminder to grow older playfully and on her terms. The symbolism behind the red hat affected women Cooper encountered. Those women responded by wearing their own red hats and entering a new women’s movement that embraced a renewed outlook on life filled with fun and friendship, fulfilling lifelong dreams. Cooper repeated the gift on request several times, and eventually several of the women bought purple outfits and held a tea party on April 25, 1998, at which the Red Hat Society began. After spreading by word of mouth, the society first received national publicity in the year 2000 through the magazine \"Romantic Homes\" and a feature in \"The Orange County Register\". Cooper then established a \"Hatquarters\" to field the hundreds of e-mail requests for help starting chapters. She now serves as \"Exalted Queen Mother\", and has written two best-selling books about the Society, \"The Red Hat Society: Friendship and Fun After Fifty\", published in April 2004 and \"The Red Hat Society's Laugh Lines: Stories of Inspiration and Hattitude\" published in April 2005. The Red Hat Society membership increased through word of mouth, growing from two chapters in 1999 to over 70,000 members. In 2011, the RHS started a process of nominating a member to be the \"Red Hatter of the Year\". Nominees are made up of inspiring women who deserve recognition for the effect they have had in the lives of others. The Red Hatter of the year is the highest national recognition given to a member who shows influence, dedication, and involvement to her community and fellow members.  The Red Hat Society is an international society of women that connects, supports and encourages women in their pursuit of fun, friendship, freedom, fulfillment and fitness while supporting members in the quest to get the most out of life. The Red Hat Society’s primary purpose is social interaction and bonding among women. In the early part of their lives, most women give their all to family, career, and community. And they enjoy it. But, along the way, sometimes their existing bonds of friendship gradually diminish. Membership in the Red Hat Society can be used for reconnecting old friends, making new friends and rediscovering the joy of getting together with other women for the express purpose of having fun. The society promotes periods of \"recess\" from the cares and duties of everyday life in which members gather for no other purpose than to play. The benefits of being a part of the Red Hat Society include interpersonal connections and emotional support systems built among Sisters (other members) both online and offline. Members of the society support one another in every life stage from all corners of the globe. RHS members are reshaping the way women are viewed in today's culture by promoting fun, friendship, freedom from stereotypes, and fulfillment of goals and dreams. The RHS sees physical fitness as the foundation on which they base healthy, rewarding lives. A founder or leader of a local chapter is usually referred to as a \"Queen\". Members 50 and over are called \"Red Hatters\" and wear red hats and purple attire to all functions. A woman under age 50 may also become a member, but she wears a pink hat and lavender attire to the society's events until reaching her 50th birthday. She is referred to as a “Pink Hatter.” During her birthday month (or the society's birthday month of April), a member might wear her colors in reverse, i.e., a purple or lavender hat and red or pink attire. Women who wish to join the society can do so by going to the Red Hat Society website to sign up as a Queen or Member. Individuals can then search for chapters based on location or geography and then connect with local chapters by using tools on the society website. Any woman may join the Red Hat Society as a Queen of an individual chapter or as a supporting member of a local chapter. There are supporting members who do not belong to any local chapter but have access to the RHS website, online communities, special communications, and discounts. Both Red and Pink Hatters often wear very elaborately decorated hats and attention-getting fashion accessories, such as a feather boa, at the group's get-togethers. The Red Hat Society is dedicated to encouragement of a positive life outlook through the sisterhood of a local chapter. Members gather in large and small local chapters to have fun and support one another, though some Hatters chose to remain individual members and participate in activities as their schedule allows. The society's events vary depending on the chapter, but one of the most common activities among Red Hatters include hosting tea parties, playing games, going to movies or theater events, traveling on excursions and to larger RHS conventions. The organization has published several books: The Red Hat Society has spread to other countries in the world. As of 2011, besides the thousands of chapters in the U.S., there were local chapters of the Society in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Ecuador, England, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guam, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, Mexico, Namibia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, Scotland, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, and Wales."]}

The club was founded on 21 April 1943, during World War II, as a result of local clubs based in the city coming together to form one large club. From 1992 to 2007, the club was referred to as FC Nantes Atlantique before reverting to its current name at the start of the 2007–08 season. Nantes currently play in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. Nantes is one of the most successful clubs in French football, having won eight Ligue 1 titles, three Coupe de France wins and attained one Coupe de la Ligue victory. The club is famous for its \"jeu à la nantaise\" (\"Nantes-style play\"), its collective spirit, mainly advocated under coaches José Arribas, Jean-Claude Suaudeau and Raynald Denoueix and for its youth system, which has produced players such as Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps, Mickaël Landreau, Claude Makélélé, Christian Karembeu and Jérémy Toulalan. As well as \"Les Canaris\" (\"The Canaries\"), Nantes is also nicknamed \"Les jaunes et verts\" (\"The Green and Yellows\") and \"La Maison Jaune\" (\"The Yellow House\"). The club was founded in 1943. The first match played by Nantes as a professional team took place at the Stade Olympique de Colombes against CA Paris, where Nantes triumphed 2–0. The first home match was a defeat of the same score against Troyes. The club finished fifth at the end of this first season following which the club's manager Aimé Nuic left the club following a dispute, and was succeeded by Antoine Raab, who took over in a player-coach role. After winning 16 consecutive matches, Nantes lost 9–0 to Sochaux. In July 1991, the club re-instated Jean-Claude Suaudeau, and in July 1992, after spending a fortnight in the second division due to an administrative decision by the \"DNCG\" (French Football's financial regulator), FC Nantes was renamed FC Nantes Atlantique, and was able to take its place in the first division back. They won the French championship in 1994/95 and in 2000/01. In 2005, Nantes narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season by defeating Metz 1-0. The following season Nantes finished last in Ligue 1 and were relegated to Ligue 2 after spending over 40 consecutive seasons in Ligue 1. In 2007, Nantes were promoted back to Ligue 1 at the first attempt but the following season they were relegated back to Ligue 2 after finishing 19th on the table. After spending 3 seasons in Ligue 2, Nantes were once again promoted to Ligue 1 in 2013. In their first season back in the top division, Nantes avoided relegation finishing 13th on the table. After two years of stability, in the 2016/2017 Ligue 1 season, Nantes finished a highly respectable 7th on the table. For the 2017/2018 season, former Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri took over as manager and after 10 games in charge had Nantes sitting 3rd on the table just behind big spending Paris Saint-Germain and AS Monaco.

Leir dwelt in the realm of Avalon with the other Celtic gods. When the Heliopolitan god Seth sought to make war against the other gods, he dispatched foul beasts to both Avalon and Asgard. When Thor pursued one of these beasts, the griffin-like beast traveled through a dimensional rift to Avalon, and Thor followed. When the Celtic gods saw Thor, they blamed him for the beasts, and Leir battled Thor through the misunderstanding. Hogun the Grim had followed Thor to offer his support, and when one of the beasts appeared, the gods knew that none of them were responsible for the beasts.

The country that accumulates the most points after both legs will win the competition, followed by goal difference and a penalty shoot-out if necessary. The format was changed in 2014 and now the game takes place as a one-off match in a neutral venue. In the 2011 and 2012 editions the squads of each team were composed of footballers playing in either the Argentine or Brazilian league. However, this rule was changed for the 2014 edition and both teams can now call up players based in other countries, such as those of Europe."]}

The group stage featured 32 teams: the 22 automatic qualifiers and the 10 winners of the play-off round (five through the Champions Route, five through the League Route). The teams were drawn into eight groups of four, and played each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 13–14 September, 27–28 September, 18–19 October, 1–2 November, 22–23 November, and 6–7 December 2011. The top two teams in each group advanced to the first knockout round, while the third-placed teams dropped down to the Europa League round of 32. The draw for the group stage was held at Grimaldi Forum, Monaco on 25 August 2011 at 17:45 CEST (). Teams were seeded into four pots based on their 2011 UEFA club coefficients. The title holders, Barcelona, were automatically seeded into Pot 1. Pot 1 held teams ranked 1–9, Pot 2 held teams ranked 10–24, Pot 3 held teams ranked 31–83, while Pot 4 held teams ranked 86–200 and unranked teams. th Title Holder. The title holder automatically gets the top position of seeding list. For the group stage draw, teams from the same national association cannot be drawn against each other. Moreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage. The fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There are other restrictions, e.g., teams from the same city (e.g. Milan and Internazionale, which also share a stadium) do not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tries to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days), and Russian teams do not play at home on the last matchday due to cold weather. If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria would be applied to determine the rankings: Times up to 29 October 2011 (matchdays 1–3) are CEST (), thereafter (matchdays 4–6) times are CET ().", "2011–12 APOEL F.C. season\n2011–12 APOEL F.C. season The 2011–12 season was APOEL's 72nd season in the Cypriot First Division and 84th year in existence as a football club. The first training session for the season took place on 8 June 2011 at GSP Stadium. On 19 June 2011, the team flew to Obertraun in Austria to perform the main stage of their pre-season training. APOEL returned to Cyprus on 2 July 2011. During the pre-season training stage in Austria, APOEL participated in Salzburg Airport Cup and played in total four friendly matches. APOEL completed the regular season of the 2011–12 Cypriot First Division having 17 wins, 5 draws and 4 losses, scoring 39 goals and conceding 13 goals. So, APOEL entered championship play-offs from the third place with 56 points, four points behind leaders AEL Limassol (60 points) and one point behind second placed Omonia (57 points). In the first championship play-off match, APOEL won Omonia by 2–1, with a last-minute winner from Gustavo Manduca and moved up to the second place, only two points behind leaders AEL Limassol who in the same day drew 1–1 at Anorthosis. In the second play-off match, APOEL suffered a 2–1 home loss from Anorthosis and leaders AEL Limassol (who at the same day won Omonia by 2–0) gained a five-points advantage. In the next play-off match, Ivan Tričkovski's last-minute winner helped APOEL beat AEL Limassol 1–0 at home, to reduce AEL's lead to just two points. Another match between AEL Limassol and APOEL followed one week later, but the two teams drew 0–0 in Limassol and AEL remained two points clear of APOEL, with only two matches remaining. On 5 May 2012, APOEL lost from Omonia at home by 2–1 and at the same day AEL Limassol crowned champions by beating Anorthosis 1–0 at Limassol. In the last match of the season, APOEL won Anorthosis at Larnaca by 2–1 and secured the second place in the league. On 7 August 2011, APOEL won the 2011 Cypriot Super Cup by beating Omonia 1–0 in the GSP Stadium. The winner came from Christos Kontis in the 81st minute. In the first round of the 2011–12 Cypriot Cup, APOEL eliminated Akritas Chlorakas by winning 9–1 in a knock-out match which was held at GSP Stadium. In the last 16 of the Cup, APOEL faced up AEL Limassol in a two-legged tie and lost 0–1 on aggregate. In the first match at GSP Stadium, APOEL lost 0–1 from a Patrick Vouho's goal in the 40th minute. On the return leg, APOEL was held to a 0–0 draw, and so eliminated very early from the competition. The team won the Cypriot championship last season and as such entered the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round. A successful campaign saw them through to the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stages by eliminating Skënderbeu Korçë (6–0 agg.), Slovan Bratislava (2–0 agg.) and Wisła Kraków (3–2 agg.). APOEL drawn in Group G, alongside F.C. Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and Zenit St. Petersburg. On 13 September 2011, APOEL hosted Zenit St. Petersburg in GSP Stadium and secured its first ever victory in the UEFA Champions League group stage proper with a 2–1 comeback victory against the Russian side. Konstantin Zyryanov put Zenit ahead in the 63rd minute but APOEL was rewarded for its attacking play 10 minutes later when Gustavo Manduca pounced on a loose ball in the box and slotted the ball into the Zenit net. The winner came two minutes later when Brazilian striker Aílton evaded the Zenit defense and shot into the far corner past goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev. In its second match in the group, APOEL held Shakhtar Donetsk to a 1–1 draw at the Donbass Arena and stayed in first place in the group. APOEL took the lead when the striker Ivan Tričkovski finished off a counterattack in the 61st minute. Shakhtar equalised three minutes later when Jádson scored. Another away match followed against F.C. Porto and APOEL drew 1–1 at Dragão to extend its unbeaten start and keep them on the top of Group G. Brazilian forward Hulk put F.C. Porto ahead after 13 minutes with a curving free-kick from distance and APOEL levelled six minutes later when Aílton received the ball close to the Porto area, dribbled past Fernando and sent a diagonal shot that gave the goalkeeper Helton no chance to block. However, on the last minute of added time APOEL could have won the match, but substitute Aldo Adorno was denied the winner by a block from Helton. On 1 November 2011, APOEL hosted F.C. Porto in GSP Stadium and Gustavo Manduca's last-minute winner meant APOEL remained unbeaten at the top of Group G, securing at least a place in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League knockout phase. On 42nd minute, Aílton was tripped by Eliaquim Mangala and the referee immediately signaled a penalty. The Brazilian striker stepped up and sent Helton the wrong way, scoring his third goal in the competition. On the 89th minute F.C. Porto won a penalty and Hulk made no mistake from the spot, equalizing for the visitors. It looked like the Portuguese side had salvaged a draw, but in the 90th minute Constantinos Charalambides fired in an accurate cross and found Gustavo Manduca in the box, whose left-footed strike from close range sealed the win for APOEL.  On 23 November 2011, APOEL made history and became the first Cypriot team to reach the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League by holding Zenit St. Petersburg to a 0–0 draw in Petrovsky Stadium. APOEL eventually reached the last 16 as a group winner, despite losing its unbeaten record after a 0–2 home defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk on the final match day. Luiz Adriano (who had in the first half a penalty saved by Urko Pardo) and Yevhen Seleznyov scored second-half goals for Shakhtar to win its first group stage match that season, but APOEL stayed top of Group G after Zenit St. Petersburg drew 0–0 at F.C. Porto. In its first participation to the UEFA Champions League last 16, APOEL drawn against French side Olympique Lyonnais. The first leg was held at Stade de Gerland on 14 February 2012, in front of over 5,000 travelling APOEL supporters. Lyon overcame APOEL's tight defense with a second-half goal by Alexandre Lacazette and secured a slender advantage by winning 1–0. In the second leg which was held at GSP Stadium on 7 March 2012, Gustavo Manduca's ninth-minute opener levelled the tie 1–1 on aggregate. After 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time the game remained 1–0 for APOEL and went to a penalty shoot-out. On the penalty shoot-out, Dionisis Chiotis made two saves by diving to his left to block penalties from Alexandre Lacazette and Michel Bastos, while APOEL converted all four of its own spot kicks and won 4–3, reaching the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals for the first time. APOEL has been drawn to face Spanish giants Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. In the first leg which was held at GSP Stadium on 27 March 2012, APOEL stood well for 74 minutes, but Real Madrid ran out 3–0 winners thanks to late goals from Karim Benzema (74', 90') and Kaká (82'). In the return leg which was held at Santiago Bernabéu on 4 April 2012, Real Madrid took a 2–0 lead in the first half by Cristiano Ronaldo's (26') and Kaká's (37') goals. Gustavo Manduca scored a goal for APOEL in the 67th minute after an excellent through ball from Aílton, but Ronaldo scored his second goal with a free-kick in the 75th minute to make it 3–1 for Real Madrid. Substitute José Callejón scored in the 80th minute but two minutes later APOEL won a penalty after Hamit Altıntop brought down Aldo Adorno and Esteban Solari beat Iker Casillas from the spot to make it 4–2. Finally, another goal scored by Ángel Di María in the 84th minute and Real Madrid won by 5–2, reaching the semi-finals with an aggregate score of 8–2 and giving an end to APOEL's impressive run in the competition. \"Last Update: 19 January 2012\" \"For recent transfers, see List of Cypriot football transfers summer 2011.\"  EU Nationals EU Nationals (Dual citizenship) Non-EU Nationals In: Out: \"1–1 on aggregate.

{"query": "Bob Brown political career instead of Tasmanian logging protests", "pos": ["Bob Brown\nBob Brown Robert James Brown (born 27 December 1944) is a former Australian politician, medical doctor, and environmentalist who is a former Senator, and former Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens. Brown was elected to the Australian Senate on the Tasmanian Greens ticket, joining with sitting Greens Western Australia senator Dee Margetts to form the first group of Australian Greens senators following the 1996 federal election. He was re-elected in 2001 and in 2007. He was the first openly gay member of the Parliament of Australia, and the first openly gay leader of an Australian political party. While serving in the Tasmanian parliament, Brown successfully campaigned for a large increase in the protected wilderness areas. Brown led the Australian Greens from the party's foundation in 1992 until April 2012, a period in which polls grew to around 10% at state and federal levels (13.9% of the primary vote in 2010). From 2002 to 2004, when minor parties held the balance of power in the Senate, Brown became a well-recognised politician. In October 2003 Brown was the subject of international media interest when he was suspended from the parliament for interjecting during an address by United States president George W. Bush. On 13 April 2012, Brown resigned as leader of the Greens and indicated his intention to resign from the Senate in June. This occurred on 15 June 2012. Brown was born in Oberon, New South Wales, one of twins, and attended Trunkey Public School, Coffs Harbour High School (1957–60) and Blacktown Boys High School. In his senior year, he was elected school captain. After graduating, Brown enrolled in medicine at University of Sydney, where he obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degree. Brown practised medicine for a time at the Royal Canberra Hospital. During his tenure at the hospital, he and other senior medical staff took a pacifist stance by refusing to certify young men who did not wish to fight in the Vietnam War as fit to be conscripted. He then worked as a resident at Darwin and Alice Springs hospitals. At the latter post, he met John Hawkins, a surgeon who had kayaked rivers in Tasmania. Brown travelled to London in 1970 and worked at Hounslow Cottage Hospital and St Mary Abbot's Hospital in South Kensington. He was the resident doctor on duty at St Mary Abbot's Hospital when the body of Jimi Hendrix was brought in. At the time of his retirement, many media outlets erroneously reported that he had pronounced Hendrix dead. Brown later clarified that, while he had been on duty when Hendrix was brought in, \"he had been dead for some hours\", and Hendrix was officially pronounced dead by a different doctor—who was, coincidentally, also an Australian. Brown moved to Tasmania in 1972 and worked as a general practitioner in Launceston. He soon became involved in the state's environmental movement, in particular the campaign to save Lake Pedder. By 1972, he was a member of the newly formed United Tasmania Group, Australia's first \"green\" party. In 1976, he fasted for a week on top of Mt Wellington in protest against the arrival at Hobart of the nuclear-powered warship . In 1978 Brown was appointed director of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society. In the late 1970s he emerged as a leader of the campaign to prevent construction of the Franklin Dam, which would have flooded the Franklin River valley as part of a hydroelectricity project. Brown was among the 1500 people arrested while protesting during the campaign. He subsequently spent 19 days in Hobart's Risdon Prison. On the day of his release in 1983, he became a member of Tasmania's parliament for the House of Assembly seat of Denison after the Democrats MP Norm Sanders resigned to successfully stand for the Australian Senate; Brown was elected to replace him on a countback. The Franklin campaign was a success after Federal government intervention protected the Franklin River in 1983. During his first term of office, Brown introduced a wide range of private member's initiatives, which include freedom of information, death with dignity, lowering parliamentary salaries, gay law reform, banning the battery-hen industry and advocation for nuclear free Tasmania. His 1987 bill to ban semi-automatic guns was voted down by both Liberal and Labor members of Tasmania's House of Assembly, nine years before the Port Arthur massacre resulted in a successful federal Liberal bid to achieve the same results. In 1989 Tasmania's system of proportional representation allowed the Greens to win five out of 35 seats in the Tasmanian House of Assembly and Brown became their leader. He agreed to support a minority Labor Party government, on the basis of a negotiated Accord (signed by Michael Field and Bob Brown) in which the Green independents agreed to support the budget but not motions of no confidence, and the ALP agreed to develop a more open parliamentary process, to consult on departmental appointments, provide a legislative research service, parity in parliamentary staffing and a reform agenda which included equal opportunities, freedom of information, national parks protection and public disclosure of bulk power contracts and royalties from mining companies. This agreement, however, broke down over forestry issues in 1992. In 1993 Brown resigned from the House of Assembly and stood unsuccessfully for the federal House of Representatives.   Brown was elected to the Australian Senate for Tasmania in 1996, and was an outspoken voice in opposition to the conservative government of John Howard, and in support of green and human rights issues, including international issues such as Tibet, East Timor and West Papua. He also introduced bills for constitutional reform, forest protection, to block radioactive waste dumping, to ban mandatory sentencing of Aboriginal children, to prohibit the use of cluster munitions and for greenhouse abatement. At the 2001 federal election Brown was re-elected to the Senate with a greatly increased vote, and was outspoken on Prime Minister John Howard's refusal to allow 438 asylum seekers (mostly from Afghanistan) to land on Christmas Island after they had been rescued from their sinking boat in the Indian Ocean by the MV Tampa, a Norwegian freighter. Brown was equally critical of Opposition Leader Kim Beazley's acquiescence to John Howard's stance on the Tampa incident. Brown was particularly vocal in his opposition to Australian participation in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became recognised as a leading voice for the anti-war/peace movement. When President Bush visited Canberra on 23 October 2003, Brown and fellow Senator Kerry Nettle interjected during his address to a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament. During Bush's speech Brown and Nettle wore signs referring to David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, two Australian citizens held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, at that time (Habib was later released without charge and Hicks served a prison term for providing material support for terrorism), following their apprehension by United States forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan respectively. Bush accepted the interjections with good humour but the Speaker of the House, Neil Andrew formally \"named\" Brown and Nettle. This meant that they were both suspended from the Parliament for 24 hours which prevented them from being present during a similar address from Chinese President Hu Jintao the next day. After the speech, however, Brown shook Bush's hand. Brown opposed the Howard Government's amendments to the Marriage Act in 2004, stating that \"Mr Howard should relax and accept gay marriages as part of the future's social fabric\". In December 2004, forestry and export woodchip company Gunns Limited attempted to sue Brown and others for $6.3 million, in an action which media reports say related to \"ongoing damaging campaigns and activities\" against the company. The original Statement of Claim issued by Gunns was struck out by the Supreme Court and costs were awarded against Gunns for the initial proceedings. Gunns ultimately failed with the company finally dropping all claims against Brown on 13 December 2006 while continuing its case against others including The Wilderness Society. Brown was formally elected as the first Federal Parliamentary Leader of The Greens on 28 November 2005, following almost a decade of service as de facto leader since his election to the Senate in 1996. In February 2007, the Tasmanian State Government and the Australian Federal Government responded by changing the text of the State's Regional Forest Agreement. New clauses make it clear that the word 'protection' relates only to whether the two respective governments deem a species to be protected rather than the meaning of the word being based on actual evidence of such. In early 2007, Brown attracted scorn from sections of the media and the major political parties for his proposal to commit to a plan within three years, that would eventually see the banning of coal exports. Brown described coal exports as the \"energy industry's heroin habit\" and stated that the export of alternative technologies should be the priority. Brown was re-elected in the 2007 federal election. He announced his intention to stand again at the Greens National Conference in November 2005. Following his re-election and that of the new Labor Government, Brown called on the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, to set fixed carbon targets immediately, and to announce their levels at the upcoming United Nations Bali Climate Change Conference in December 2007, continuing his climate campaigning, and saying that it was \"obvious\" what the outcome would be if Australia was to not set carbon emissions goals. In 2005, Brown brought a legal case against Forestry Tasmania in the Federal Court, in an attempt to protect Tasmania's Wielangta forest from clearfell logging. The 1997 Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) exempted logging operations from endangered species laws but required the protection of endangered species. Bob Brown brought a case against Forestry Tasmania citing threats to endangered species like the Swift parrot and Wielangta Stag Beetle. In December 2006, Judge Shane Marshall awarded the case in Brown's favour. On appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court level, the case was lost, without rejecting the earlier judgement that logging would further endanger these species. In May 2008 the High Court denied leave to appeal that decision after the wording of the RFA was changed. Brown was ordered to pay $240,000 to Forestry Tasmania, which he said he could not afford to pay. Failure to pay would have resulted in bankruptcy proceedings which would have cost Brown his Senate seat. Brown had earlier rejected a settlement offer from Forestry Tasmania that would have required him to have only paid $200,000 of the costs he had incurred. On 9 June 2009, Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith promised to help bail him out if necessary, an offer that was not needed after pledges of support from over 1,000 donors covered Brown's legal bill within a few days of his announcement. In 2011, after the 2010–2011 Queensland floods Brown drew criticism for suggesting that half the Mineral Resource Rent Tax be allocated to future natural catastrophes. He made comments to the effect that climate change, specifically the impact on climate from the mining sector should be held at least partially responsible for the flooding. On 24 March 2012, at the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Tasmanian Greens, Senator Bob Brown warned about degradation of the Earth and the impact that could have on future generations. As a possible approach to pre-empting this he proposed a Global Parliament. He was met with a standing ovation. The then deputy leader Christine Milne said it was \"a very inspiring speech\". There was criticism of his approach. At the Global Greens Conference in Dakar, Senegal Africa, 1 April 2012, Bob Brown advocated that there be established a \"global parliament\" where \"every citizen should have an equal say\". The final resolution supported by the Australian Greens and others, was passed. On 13 April 2012, Senator Brown resigned as leader of the Greens and announced that he would be resigning from the Senate in June when his replacement was available. His deputy, Christine Milne, became Greens leader, and federal Melbourne MP Adam Bandt became Greens deputy leader. Peter Whish-Wilson, who had formerly stood for the Greens, was selected as Brown's replacement in the Senate. Senator Brown's resignation took place on 15 June 2012 at 3:30 pm, when he handed his resignation to Senate President John Hogg. Peter Whish-Wilson was sworn into the Senate on 21 June. Brown set up the Bob Brown Foundation with his longtime partner Paul Thomas to promote environmental awareness. Since its establishment, the Bob Brown Foundation has given out national awards to many Australian environmentalists including Miranda Gibson, Charlie Wood, Isaac Astill, and Drew Hutton. Brown is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations. Brown was a speaker at the Save the Kimberley concert, held on 5 October 2012. Held at Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia, the concert was part of a long-running campaign to protest against a proposal to industrialise the James Price Point area in Broome, Western Australia, Australia. Brown had also addressed a rally on 2 September 2012 in Sydney, Australia. Brown appeared at another concert in support of the Kimberley cause on 24 February 2013, with musicians Missy Higgins and John Butler also appearing, with the event held at The Esplanade in Fremantle, Western Australia. Jarrah Records, the record label that Butler co-founded with musical trio The Waifs and band manager Phil Stevens, worked in partnership with The Wilderness Society to stage the free event that also featured the band Ball Park Music. A march to protest the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the free concert and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards. On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Brown would be taking over as director of the Australian chapter of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a non-profit, marine conservation organisation. He stepped down in April 2014. In January 2016, Brown was arrested after refusing to leave the Lapoinya Forest in Tasmania, where preparations for logging were under way. Along with another protester, who had been arrested a few days earlier, he was charged with an offence under Tasmania’s Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014. Although the charges were dropped, the two went to the High Court to argue that the provisions under which they had been charged were unconstitutional. In October 2017 the High Court agreed, by a majority although for differing reasons, that the provisions were invalid in that they breached the constitutional freedom of political communication. In August 2016, Brown joined the crew of Sea Shepherd on board their ship \"Steve Irwin\", as it joined the campaign against proposed drilling in the Great Australian Bight. In a newspaper interview in 1976, Brown announced that he had a same-sex partner to highlight discrimination and encourage law reform as homosexual activity was a crime in Tasmania at the time. Brown currently lives in Cygnet, Tasmania with his long-time partner, Paul Thomas, a farmer and activist whom he met in 1996. Brown was the founder, in 1990, of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund, now Bush Heritage Australia, a non-profit environmental organisation dedicated to purchasing and preserving Australian bushland. He was President of the organisation until 1996. On 20 March 2011 Brown donated a 14-hectare (35-acre) property and house he had owned for 38 years to Bush Heritage Australia. The property is located 47 kilometres (29 miles) south-west of Launceston, Tasmania, in the Liffey Valley. According to Australian Geographic, it is a site of historic and symbolic significance. Brown describes himself as a \"lapsed Presbyterian\". In an interview with Richard Fidler on ABC radio, Nigel Brennan, an Australian photojournalist who was kidnapped in Somalia and held hostage for 462 days, revealed Brown had contributed $100,000 of his own money to help pay the ransom for his release. It was also revealed that Brown contacted Australian businessman Dick Smith asking that he also contribute funds towards the release of Brennan Brennan, who was released in November 2009, also stated in this interview that Brown had to borrow this money, an assertion also made in various media outlets at the time of Brennan's release.

It was the second single released from his successful album \"Born in the U.S.A.\" Springsteen wrote the song for Donna Summer. However, his manager, Jon Landau, decided the song had hit potential, and so he kept it for the upcoming Springsteen album. The song was recorded in January 1982, during the first wave of the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" sessions. At the time, the song was originally suggested for Donna Summer, but rejected by Jon Landau in favor of \"Protection\" (another song written by Springsteen). An unreleased \"outtake\" of the song, titled \"Drop On Down and Cover Me\", has long been considered a precursor to the officially released \"Cover Me\", but was actually recorded much later over the course of the album sessions. The song peaked at #7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles charts in October 1984. It was the second of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from \"Born in the U.S.A.\" No music video was made for the song. Continuing the club play goal started with \"Dancing in the Dark\", Arthur Baker created the 12-inch \"Undercover Mix\" of \"Cover Me\". This was a large-scale transformation: a new bass line was cut, an unused backing vocal by industry legend Jocelyn Brown was restored, and reggae and dub elements were introduced. It was released on October 15, 1984. As with the previous effort, the result displeased some of Springsteen's more strait-laced fans, but did gain actual club play: the remix went to number 11 on Billboard's Hot Dance/Disco chart.  The B-side of the single, \"Jersey Girl\", was a live performance of a Tom Waits song, recorded on July 9, 1981 at Meadowlands Arena. Springsteen had introduced the song earlier in that special River Tour homecoming stand that opened the arena, slightly rewriting it to replace a Waits line about \"whores on Eighth Avenue\" and adding a verse that included \"that little brat of yours and drop[ping] her off at your mom's.\" \"Jersey Girl\" would become a Springsteen fan favorite, although played rarely as time went on. Differing pressings of the single had different lengths of \"Jersey Girl\", sometimes dropping a spoken introduction.  Springsteen was unsure of how to play \"Cover Me\" in concert, and initially it appeared irregularly in the 1984-1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour. Then, inspired by Arthur Baker's remix, he rearranged it to open and close with a quiet, ominous, extended, echoing segment as new E Street backup singer Patti Scialfa wailed a snippet of Martha & the Vandellas' \"Nowhere to Run\" (in her one spotlight role of the show) while her future husband reverbed \"Cuh ... vuh ... me-ee-ee\", after which the song ramped up into showcase guitar work for Springsteen and Nils Lofgren. \"Cover Me\" thus became a featured song on the tour, often opening the second set; such a performance was included on the 1986 \"Live/1975-85\". \"Cover Me\" continued as a regular selection on the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! Tours, and the 1992 leg of the \"Other Band\" Tour (now without Scialfa's part). After December 1992 it was dropped until Springsteen's first concert in Oslo on July 7, 2008 and most recently in Philadelphia on October 20, 2009. The song has been performed 300 times through 2008. The song has turned up as a semi-regular on the Working On A Dream Tour, especially after Springsteen and the E Street Band began playing the entire \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album in New York and Philadelphia."]}

Displaying dragons allows the player to earn \"dragoncash\". Dragoncash can be used to upgrade a park with new islands, habitats, and decorations. Currently the game has a max park level of 125, and there is a total dragon count of 454 (174 elemental dragons, 169 special dragons, and 182 epic dragons), decoration count of 280, and an island count of 25. Basic elemental dragons can produce a specific set of hybrid dragons by being paired in the Breeding Cave, the Epic Breeding Island, the Berrywhite Breeding Cave, which is only available during Valentine's, or the Cooperative Breeding Cave. The ten basic elements are plant, fire, earth, cold, lightning, water, air, metal, light, and dark. Epic dragons are rarer than basic elemental dragons and hybrids. Types of Epic dragon include Sun, Moon, Rainbow, Treasure, Olympus, Gemstone, Dream, Seasonal, Apocalypse, Chrysalis, Ornamental, Crystalline, Snowflake, Monolith, Aura, Hidden, Galactic, and Surface. There are a number of limited or rare dragons, known as \"Special Dragons\", that are only available during a specific period of time. These dragons are themed toward specific holidays, seasons, anomalies, months, and events. For example, the Ghost dragon is available for Halloween and the Reindeer dragon is available for the winter holidays. Many Epic dragons are also limited; for example, the Leap Year Dragon that is theoretically only available every 4 years. Limited dragons are often released alongside a limited park decoration. Limited dragons include the gemstone dragons, which correspond to the monthly birthstones. Gemstone dragons earn gems rather than dragoncash. Backflip Studios has held several \"bring them back\" events to give players a chance to breed a limited dragon they may have missed the first time around. Gems are a vital part of DragonVale. Without them certain goals take longer to achieve. Gems can be acquired through trading them with friends, winning them in the colosseum and race track, purchasing them directly, or from gemstone dragons. The Rift is another dimension in the game. In the Rift, Gems and Dragoncash are useless, the player must collect Etherium, the best way to collect Etherium is having dragons in the rift. The rift has a maximum of 40 habitats. Many dragons can go into the rift, but the rift has 27 special dragons. Though breeding is the most common way to earn non-basic dragons, they can also be bought from the market for gems unless they are the basic elemental dragons, for which you can use dragoncash. Players can buy new islands to make space for more habitats although there is a limit on habitats. Players raise dragons to adulthood by feeding them treats grown from treat farms, won from the race track, or earned from the completion of quests. The higher level a dragon is, the more dragoncash it will earn per minute. Different dragons earn dragoncash at different rates. For example, a Gift dragon at level 10 can only earn 77 dragoncash per minute while a level 10 Moon Dragon can earn 256 coins per minute. Rainbow Dragons can earn 400 dragoncash per minute at level 10. There have also been several events held in relation to time of year or holidays that require the player to do a number of activities like collecting Dragoncash/Gems, hatching or selling dragons after incubation, and other special provisions. These activities give the player a certain limited time currency that corresponds to the event and enables the player to buy exclusive or unique items.

{"query": "Okehampton Castle architectural style and construction details instead of its historical ownership by Norman families\")\n\n```", "pos": ["Okehampton Castle\nOkehampton Castle Okehampton Castle is a medieval motte and bailey castle in Devon, England. It was built between 1068 and 1086 by Baldwin FitzGilbert following a revolt in Devon against Norman rule, and formed the centre of the Honour of Okehampton, guarding a crossing point across the West Okement River. It continued in use as a fortification until the late 13th century, when its owners, the de Courtenays, became the Earls of Devon. With their new wealth, they redeveloped the castle as a luxurious hunting lodge, building a new deer park that stretched out south from the castle, and constructing fashionable lodgings that exploited the views across the landscape. The de Courtenays prospered and the castle was further expanded to accommodate their growing household. The de Courtenays were heavily involved in the 15th century Wars of the Roses and Okehampton Castle was frequently confiscated. By the early 16th century the castle was still in good condition, but after Henry Courtenay was executed by Henry VIII the property was abandoned and left to decay, while the park was rented out by the Crown. Parts of the castle were reused as a bakery in the 17th century, but by the 19th century it was completely ruined and became popular with Picturesque painters, including J. M. W. Turner. Renovation work began properly in the 20th century, first under private ownership and then, more extensively, after the castle was acquired by the state. In the 21st century it is controlled by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction. Okehampton Castle was built between 1068 and 1086 following the Norman conquest of England by Baldwin FitzGilbert. William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxon forces at the battle of Hastings in 1066, but violence continued to flare up periodically for several years after the invasion. Baldwin FitzGilbert, a Norman lord, was responsible for putting down a rebellion in Devon in 1068. He was probably given extensive lands in the county at this time, and by the time of Domesday Book in 1086 he was noted as the owner of the Honour of Okehampton and well as the Sheriff of Devon and Constable of Exeter Castle. The Honour of Okehampton was a grouping of around 200 estates across Devon, guarded by several castles, including Baldwin's main castle - or caput - at Okehampton, and those owned by his tenants, including Neroche and Montacute. Baldwin's castle was positioned to protect an important route from Devon into Cornwall, including two fords that formed a crossing point over the West Okement River, and to control the existing town of Ocmundtune. The castle was protected by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to Baldwin's tenants in exchange for their contributing to the castle's garrison. Baldwin also established a new town near the castle about away, complete with a market and a mill to grind grain. This town eventually dominated the older Anglo-Saxon settlement and became known as Okehampton.  On Baldwin's death the castle was inherited by his daughter, Adeliza, but the family appear to have taken little interest in the property. Okehampton Castle does not seem to have played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy. In 1173 Okehampton Castle passed to Renaud de Courtenay in marriage; his son, Robert de Courtenay married the daughter of William de Redvers, the Earl of Devon. The castle continued to have military utility and was requisitioned by Richard I between 1193 and 1194 to assist in the royal defence of Devon. The de Courteneys carried out some building work at the castle, installing new structures in the castle bailey. Robert was followed by his son John de Courtenay and by 1274, when John's son Hugh de Courtenay had inherited the property, the castle was reported to comprise only \"an old motte which is worth nothing, and outside the motte a hall, chamber and kitchen poorly built\", although this may underestimate the extent and condition of the castle. The Redvers family line ran out in 1297, and as a result Hugh's son, another Hugh de Courtenay, inherited the Redvers family lands, later being confirmed as the Earl of Devon. Hugh's main seat was at Tiverton Castle, but Hugh and his father redeveloped Okehampton Castle, expanding its facilities and accommodation to enable it be used as a hunting lodge and retreat. Extensive building work turned the property into a luxurious residence. As part of this development, the family created a large, new deer park around the castle, replacing the older, unenclosed hunting grounds. Deer parks were an important status symbol in this period, and many nobles who acquired power and wealth for the first time chose to undertake similar projects. Creating the park, which spread out from the south of the castle to cover , required clearing away the older settlements around the castle and abandoning various fields and pastures. These settlements, comprising long houses built in warmer climate of the 12th and early 13th century, may already have become less sustainable due to the onset of the cooler climate that began to emerge at the end of the 13th. Land near the castle, later called Kennel Field, was used to hold required the packs of dogs for hunting. Once the castle's deer park was established, intensively farmed fallow deer became common on the lands, although wild boar, foxes and hare were also hunted. Like other rural castles, the occupants of Okehampton Castle consumed a relatively large amount of venison, a prestige meat during the period. Some of this would have come from the surrounding deer park, but prime cuts of venison, such as the haunches, were also brought in specially from other locations. Excavations have shown that in addition to fish from large ponds in the park, Okehampton Castle also imported fish from the coast, over away, with hake, herring, plaice and whiting being most commonly eaten. The Courtenays continued to own Okehampton for many years, the property passing through Hugh's son, Hugh, to his grandson Edward and then his great-grandson, another Hugh de Courtnenay. The size of noble households expanded during the period, and by the 1380s, when Edward controlled the castle, his \"familiars\", or extended household, could be up to 135 strong. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries Okehampton Castle's facilities were extended further, probably to accommodate these increased numbers. In the 15th century, however, the Courtenays were embroiled in the civil conflict in England known as the Wars of the Roses between the rival alliances of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. Thomas de Courtenay fought for the Yorkists, but reconciled himself with the Lancastrians. His son, Thomas, died following his capture by the Yorkists at the battle of Towton in 1461. Edward IV confiscated Okehampton Castle, which was later returned to the family by the Lancastrian Henry VI. John Courtenay died fighting for the Lancastrians at the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 and the castle and earldom was again confiscated. When Henry VII took the throne at the end of the conflict in 1485, however, the earldom and Okehampton were returned to Edward Courteney.  Edward's son, William, enjoyed a turbulent political career, during which time the castle was again confiscated for a period, and his son, Henry, was executed by Henry VIII in 1539 and his properties confiscated, permanently breaking the link between the Courtenay family and the castle. After his death, a survey praised the castle as having \"all manner of houses of offices\", but from this time onwards the castle appears to have been abandoned and left to decay, although there is evidence that the lead and some of the stonework was taken for use on other projects. The castle's deer park was rented out by the Crown after Courtenay's execution. Ownership of the castle remained important, however, as from 1623 onwards ownership carried the right to appoint Okehampton's two Members of Parliament. Despite the battle of Sourton Down being fought in 1643 near Okehampton during the English Civil War, the castle played no part in the conflict. A bakehouse was established in the castle in the late-17th century, reusing parts of the western lodgings. The deer park was disemparked during the 18th century, reverting to farmland.  In the 18th century, the castle became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Richard Wilson painted the castle in 1771, dramatically silhouetting the keep against the sky, producing what historian Jeremy Black describes as a \"calm, entranching and melancholic\" effect. Thomas Walmesley's rendition went further, depicting Oakhampton Castle surrounded by an imaginary, Italianate lake in 1810. Thomas Girtin painted the castle in 1797, as did his friend J. M. W. Turner in 1824. Sir Vyell Vyvyan conducted some minor repairs to the castle during the 19th century. In the early 20th century Okehampton Castle was bought by a local man, Sydney Simmons, who between 1911 and 1913 cleared away the vegetation that had grown over the castle and conducted some repairs to the stonework. Simmons passed the castle to the Okehampton Castle Trust in 1917, who carried out limited repairs over the coming decades. The Ministry of Public and Works took over the site in 1967 and extensive restoration work was subsequently carried out. Extensive archaeological investigations were carried out in the 1970s at the site by Robert Higham. In the 21st century, the castle is operated as a tourist attraction by English Heritage. It is protected under law as an ancient monument and as a grade I listed building. Okehampton Castle was built along a long, thin rocky outcrop, rising up from the surrounding countryside. The stream that runs around the north side of the castle would have been more substantial in the medieval period and provided additional protection on that side, while the south side of the castle would have probably overlooked water-logged fields. The castle was mostly built from local stone, with aplite from nearby Meldon and some beerstone from south-east Devon; the interior and exterior stonework would have originally been rendered with lime plaster. The castle's final design involved a visitor entering from the barbican in the north-east, along a long passageway up the hill, into the bailey. On the south-west side of the bailey lay the motte, mounted by the keep.  The castle's structure shows the results of its redesign at the start of the 14th century, using two very different forms of architecture. Seen from the north, where the main road carrying the general public made its way past, the castle had what Oliver Creighton terms a \"martial facade\" of traditional military defences, with narrow windows and towering defences. Seen from the deer park on the south of the property, however, the castle's lodgings and accommodation were on full display, with low walls and large windows. A similar architectural dichotomy can be seen at Ludlow and Warkworth Castles. The park was effectively fused with the south side of the castle, with the chase running right up to the property. From the two large windows of the eastern lodgings, it would have been possible to gaze out across the parklands and appreciate the extensive views without seeing any trace of rural settlements or the nearby town. The result, as historian Stephen Mileson describes, would have been \"stunning\". The barbican was built at the beginning of the 14th century and contained a guard-room on the first floor. The barbican contains numerous putlog holes from its construction, although these would have been masked by exterior plasterwork in the medieval period. A passageway led up from the barbican to the gatehouse, probably originally guarded by a drawbridge and containing the accommodation for the castle's constable.  The castle bailey contained a number of buildings by the 14th century. On the north side were the Great Hall, the buttery and the castle kitchens, the former lit by a large decorative window and partitionedfrom the kitchen and buttery by a wooden screen. Above the buttery was a luxurious solar, or apartment. On the south side of the bailey were the western lodgings, well-equipped accommodation for guests, built by in-filling part of the ditch between the motte and the bailey, and later converted into a bakery. A chapel and accommodation for the castle's chaplain lay alongside, and the chapel has remaining plaster work, which shows that the walls were painted with red lines to resemble ashlar cut stone. On the far side of the chapel were the eastern lodgings, whose detailing mirrored those at Tiverton Castle, another de Courtenay property built in the same period.  The motte, on the far side of the bailey, is predominantly made up of a natural rock outcrop, strengthened further with earth from the construction of the rest of the castle ditches. It stands up to high and measures by at the top. The motte is separated from the main castle by ditches in a similar way to the motte at Windsor Castle. On top of the motte is the castle keep, originally built in the 11th century, with massive stone walls at least one storey high and possibly as high as three storeys, and then redeveloped as a two-storey structure with a rectangular addition on the western side in the early 14th century. The 11th century parts of the keep make use of granite stone, probably taken from the river bed of the West Okement. The 14th century keep had two sets of lodgings on the upper floor, similar in style to those in the bailey, and a turret containing a staircase, some of which still survives. The keep is unusual both for the period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong defensive structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison in the event of a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were typically associated with the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight."], "neg": ["Odell Castle\nOdell Castle Odell Castle was an 11th-century castle in the village of Odell, in the county of Bedfordshire, England. The land where Odell Castle stood was originally owned by Levenot, a thegn of King Edward the Confessor. At the time, the land and village were called Wahull. After the Norman invasion, William the Conqueror gave the lands, manor, and title, to Walter de Flandrensis (circa 1068). Walter was titled the Baron of Wahull, and was thus recorded as Walter de Wahul. De Wahul built a motte-and-bailey castle, with a stone keep, on the land. The family lived here for some 400 years. In 1542, the title died out with the absence of a male heir and came into the possession of 17-year-old Agnes Woodhall, a descendant of de Wahul's. Upon her death in 1575 it passed to her son Richard Chetwood, who sold it to William Alston in 1633. The family were later created Alston baronets of Odell. By the time of the sale, the castle was already in ruins. Alston built a new residence, incorporating the remains of the keep, the oval motte of the old castle still held up by a retaining wall. Alterations were made by his descendants in the 18th century. It stayed as thus until 24 February 1931, when the manor burnt down. A new manor house was built on the site in 1962; it is currently owned by Lord Luke. The old stones were used in the construction of the new manor, but otherwise there is little left of the original castle. Only cropmarks and earthworks remain."]}

Dunn was born on 2 December 1903 in Pottawatomie County, Kansas and educated in Chicago. She first encountered Native American art at the Field Museum in Chicago in 1925. In 1928, Dunn traveled to New Mexico for the first time, where she taught second grade at the Santo Domingo Pueblo Day School, located south of Santa Fe. She learned quickly from her young Pueblo students that many features of their culture were taboo to draw or paint. In 1930, she moved to Shiprock, New Mexico to teach at the San Juan Boarding School at the Northern Navajo Agency. She finally returned to Chicago in 1931 to complete her degree at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While completing her degree, Dunn outlined plans to teach art in the Civil Service at the Santa Fe Indian School and submitted her proposal to the superintendent Chester Faris. She was given a position teaching fifth grade with a half-day to teach art to older students. The Studio School thus opened on 9 September 1932. Established Native artists Julian Martinez and Alfonso Roybal painted murals at the school to welcome the young artists. Among her students were Allan Houser, Ben Quintana, Harrison Begay, Joe Hilario Herrera, Quincy Tahoma, Andrew Tsinajinnie, Pablita Velarde, Eva Mirabal, Pop Chalee, Oscar Howe, Geronima Cruz Montoya, Sybil Yazzie, and Narcisco Abeyta. Engaged to fellow teacher Max Kramer and overwhelmed by conflicts with the school administration, Dunn resigned in the spring of 1937. Geronima Cruz Montoya (Ohkay Owingeh) replaced her as director and served until the Studio closed in 1962, when the Institute of American Indian Arts was established. Dunn believed that her students had an innate artistic ability, a belief widely promoted by Native American art teacher Angel De Cora (Ho-Chunk) at the beginning of the 20th century. Dunn taught the most basic fundamentals of painting while deliberately refraining from teaching life drawing, perspective, or color theory. Her student body initially came from the Rio Grande and Western Pueblos, and the Plains tribes. Each year the classes grew and represented a greater number of tribes. By 1937, the final year that Dunn taught at the Studio, enrollment in the program was 170. The style she taught featured heavily outlined flat fields of color, illustrative and narrative portrayals of ceremonies, dance, and mythology, painted primarily in opaque watercolors. Dunn taught a single style of painting influenced by the work of the San Ildefonso painters of the 1910s and 1920s – \"a style that she believed, rightly or wrongly, was the only authentic painting style for Native American artists to follow.\" The style she advocated, called the \"Studio Style\" or \"flat-style painting\", was inspired by Pueblo mural and pottery painting, Plains hide painting, and rock art. Dunn's strict adherence to a single style of painting has been widely criticized, especially from within the Native American community. Celebrated Chiricahua Apache sculptor, Allan Houser said, \"she trained us all the same way... Her style lacked originality and creativity.\" However, many of her students appreciated her efforts. Geronima Montoya said that Dunn \"did a lot for us. She made us realize how important our own Indian ways were, because we had been made to feel ashamed of them. She gave us something we could be proud of.\" Dunn applied and was rejected for employment by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board. She lectured about Native American art and curated and judged art shows in the United States, Belgium, Italy, and Finland. She published 18 scholarly articles in the 1950s. The government of France named her an Officier d'Académie in 1954, and the School of American Research named her an Honorary Associate. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board awarded her a certification of appreciation in 1962. In 1968, she published the book, \"American Indian Painting of the Southwest and Plains Areas.\" Her collection of paintings was donated to the Museum of New Mexico in the 1970s. In 1992, Dunn's daughter, Etel Kramer, donated her papers – scholarly and personal – to that museum. She died on 5 July 1992 in Mountain View, California from Alzheimer's disease. She was buried in San Gorgonio Memorial Park in Banning, California.", "Santa Fe Indian School\nSanta Fe Indian School The Federal Government established the Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS) in 1890 to educate Native American children from tribes throughout the Southwestern United States. The purpose of creating SFIS was an attempt to assimilate the Native American children into the wider United States culture and economy. In 1975, the All Indian Pueblo Council (AIPC) was formed. It was the first Indian organization to utilize the laws in place to contract an education for their children. Eventually, the AIPC was able to leverage complete control of the school and curriculum. In 2001, with the passing of the SFIS Act, the school took ownership of the land. The school resides on the form of a trust, which is held by the nineteen Pueblo Governors of New Mexico. These acts allow for complete educational sovereignty of the school, by the Pueblo. The original concept of the Indian Boarding School began as a social experiment predating the Civil War. Around the 1860s, the United States Federal Government created \"day schools\" to educate children about Western Civilization. They were ineffective in this process because the students did not retain the knowledge acquired at school. A factor in knowledge retention was the students returning home. After discovering this method of education was ineffective, a different approach was taken. In the 1870s, the concept of Indian Boarding Schools came into fruition. Army Lt. Richard Henry Pratt captured seventy-two Native American prisoners who fought against the Army; he tested his version of the social experiment that was previously attempted on the children. Pratt desired to mold the \"savages\" into \"civilized\" people. Pratt taught the Native American prisoners how to speak English and educated the Native Americans on European society and religion. After this educational experience, sixty-two of the Natives went to the Hampton Institute in Virginia. Deciding to extend the experiment further, Pratt was able to convince Native American families to allow their children to attend his boarding school. Richard H. Pratt founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879; the difference being, unlike day schools, Carlisle was located over a thousand miles away from the reservation. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the first boarding school specifically for Native Americans. The reasoning behind positioning the school a great distance from the reservations was that Pratt believed distance would help break the ties to Native American culture. He has been quoted as saying, \"In Indian civilization I am a Baptist, because I believe in immersing the Indian in our civilization and when we get them under, holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked.\". Pratt desired to remove the children from their Native roots, and he was harsh in the actions he took. Being that Pratt was from the Armed Forces, his background dictated how he operated the school. The students were forced to cut their hair, a symbol of their pride. One boarding school student was quoted as saying, \"[Long hair] was the pride of all Indians. The boys, one by one, would break down and cry when they saw their braids thrown on the floor. All of the buckskin clothes had to go and we had to put on the clothes of the White Man\". The students were stripped of all traces of what their culture was, such as: their long hair, their clothing, and their native language. The same student went on to say, \"This is when the loneliness set in, for it was when we knew that we were all alone. Many boys ran away from the school because the treatment was so bad, but most of them were caught and brought back by the police\". Having to deal with the oppression of the school and lack of contact from their families, the students were struck with a feeling of loneliness. Changes to the system of the Indian Boarding School took place over the 20th and 21st century. The school system reformed to its current iteration. In the 1920s, Hubert Work, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, authorized an investigation on the conditions of Indian Boarding Schools; the group reported their findings in the Meriam Report that highlighted the failures of the boarding school system. In the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a shift in Federal Native American policy began when President Roosevelt established the Indian New Deal with the purpose of protecting the Native population residing within the United States. The cornerstone of the Indian New Deal was the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934. This act allowed for the Native Americans to construct their own constitutions and govern themselves. In the same year, the Johnson O'Malley Act was passed to fund Native American education. In the year 1966, the Rough Rock Demonstration School was opened. The school was on Navajo land, and was the first boarding school controlled by the Indians. Seeing the success of the Rough Rock Demonstration School, a report was filed in 1969 entitled \"Indian Education: A National Tragedy, A National Challenge\", which stated that the U.S government's assimilation policy \"has had disastrous effects on the education of Indian children\". Following this report, the Indian Education Act of 1972 established the Office of Indian Education. The Indian Self Determination and Educational Assistance Act, established in 1975, gave the American Indians the opportunity to legislate \"self-determination through community-based schooling\". In 1990, the Native American Languages Act granted language rights to Native Americans. The Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act was established in 2006, which created programs for Native American Language immersion. These changes brought reform the Indian Boarding Schools needed. The Federal Government established the Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS) in 1890 to educate Native American children from tribes throughout the Southwestern United States. The purpose of creating SFIS was an attempt to assimilate the Native American children into the wider United States culture and economy. In 1975, the All Indian Pueblo Council (AIPC) was formed. It was the first Indian organization to utilize the laws in place to contract an education for their children. Eventually, the AIPC was able to leverage complete control of the school and curriculum. In 2001, with the passing of the SFIS Act, the school took ownership of the land. The school resides on the form of a trust, which is held by the nineteen Pueblo Governors of New Mexico. These acts allow for complete educational sovereignty of the school, by the Pueblo. In 1932, Dorothy Dunn established \"The Studio School\" at the Santa Fe Indian School. It was a painting program for Native Americans, which encouraged students to develop a painting style that was derived from their cultural traditions. Dunn left in 1937 was replaced by Geronima Cruz Montoya of Ohkay Owingeh, who taught until the program closed in 1962, with the opening of the Institute of American Indian Arts. Notable alumni of the Studio include: Since officially taking control of SFIS, the nineteen Pueblo Tribes began to take action in demolishing and renovating SFIS in the early 2000s. In 2008, the SFIS razed eighteen buildings. Some preservationists were upset by the demolition. School officials stated: \"After completing various assessments over the past five years, the Santa Fe Indian School exercised its sovereign authority and due diligence to take action by demolishing buildings to remove the imminent health, safety, and security threats to protect the students and staff of SFIS, including the general public\". There was questioning of whether or not SFIS had the right to raze the buildings. After reviewing the different laws and regulations, the sovereignty overruled the Historic Preservation Acts; the Pueblo were able to demolish the historic buildings without retribution. The Pueblo stated the buildings being torn down contained asbestos. They did not have the funds to repair the buildings and maintain them. The demolition of these historic buildings, in turn, had many benefits for the Tribes. \"A Pueblo governor reportedly called the demolition of the buildings \"a spiritual cleansing\" for his people\". \"Spiritual cleansing\" was desired by the Pueblo Tribes after years of attending Indian Boarding Schools and assimilating to different ideals. The restoration of the school contributed to enhancing and reviving the overall cultural experience of the school. The rebuilding of the school was a collaborative design build project between Albuquerque offices of Flintco Construction and ASCG. To create a homely environment, SFIS included fireplaces in the dorms and classrooms. SFIS believes creating a familiar environment will prevent students from becoming homesick and possibly reduce the dropout rate. Today there are 624 students enrolled at SFIS in grades 7-12. Out of 624 students, 155 commute and 469 live in the dorms. The school is currently 54% girls and 46% boys. The Nineteen Pueblo Tribes were the most influential in the construction of the school; they made sure the architecture reflected their traditions and contained elements of their typical architecture. \"A crucial factor in the project's success was sighting the school buildings to replicate a pueblo village while preserving views with religious significance… The buildings radiate out from a central plaza that is the focus of the site design\". The design was constructed with the intention of facilitating student comfort. The project had nineteen owners, each a governor of one of the Nineteen Pueblo Tribes. These owners had conflicting views of the project goals increasing the project difficulty, but enhancing the project's outcome. Joseph Abeyta, the Director of the SFIS at the time, believed that these new renovations were their chance to take back ownership of the school and what it represents. They would ensure the school \"would reflect and sustain their culture\". These desires were fulfilled through the design of the project. The buildings were built in adobe style. The dorms and some classrooms contained fireplaces similar to the ones from their homes. SFIS has round rooms, to stimulate These desires were fulfilled through the design of the project. The buildings were built in adobe style. The dorms and some classrooms contained fireplaces similar to the ones from their homes. SFIS has round rooms, to stimulate spirituality. These aspects tie together to produce the SFIS of today. With further construction and planning in the future, SFIS has a need to develop a reliable planning system. The goals of SFIS are to educate the students by clarifying what they must accomplish, supported by an education of Native American culture as the foundation. \"The Santa Fe Indian School remains a pivotal institution and educational training ground for the development of Indian students and their communities\". The strong relationship the school has with its tribal communities and parents is a fundamental aspect of the SFIS experience. With enhancing the educational experience and developing a new style of teaching, SFIS is looking to capitalize on the opportunities at hand and incorporate more technology into their plans. One important initiative is a branch of CBE called Agriscience, which works closely with several Pueblo communities to engage students in all aspects of farming and agricultural practices through regular community visits. They learn about their culture and science while also practicing the design and management of sustainable agriculture systems. Another branch of CBE is the Senior Honors Project (SHP). The SHP is designed to teach seniors necessary project skills in a way that helps their community address current problems. Victoria Atencio's SHP is a particularly relevant example. For her project, Honoring Mother Earth, she explored ways of reducing our impact on Earth by going back to traditional ways and focusing on renewable/alternative energy sources, enabling us to become a more sustainable community. She worked with the school's Green Team to teach her peers about more sustainable options.", "Geronima Cruz Montoya\nGeronima Cruz Montoya Gerónima Cruz Montoya (Potsunu) (September 22, 1915 – January 2, 2015 ) was an Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo artist and educator from New Mexico.

Montoya taught painting at the Santa Fe Indian School from 1937 until 1961.

{"query": "Alice Paul's suffrage movement tactics instead of her Equal Rights Amendment advocacy.", "pos": ["National Woman's Party\nNational Woman's Party The National Woman's Party (NWP) is an American women's political organization formed in 1916 to fight for women's suffrage. After achieving this goal with the 1920 adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the NWP advocated for other issues including the Equal Rights Amendment, which is still seeking ratification today. The most prominent leader of the National Woman's Party was Alice Paul. The National Woman's Party was an outgrowth of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, which had been formed in 1913 by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns to fight for women's suffrage. The National Woman's Party broke from the much larger National American Woman Suffrage Association, which was focused on attempting to gain women's suffrage at the state level. The NWP prioritized the passage of a constitutional amendment ensuring women's suffrage throughout the United States. Alice Paul was closely linked to England’s Women's Suffrage Political Union (WSPU), organized by Emmeline Pankhurst. While a college student in England, Paul became involved with the Pankhursts and their English suffrage campaign. During this time Alice Paul met Lucy Burns, who would go on and be a co-founder of the NWP. Although Paul was closely tied to the militant suffrage campaign in England, when she left to pursue suffrage in the United States, instead Paul pioneered civil disobedience in the United States. For example, members of the WSPU heckled members of parliament, spit on police officers, and committed arson. While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul continued her struggle for women's equality and organized picketing of a wartime time president to maintain attention to the lack of enfranchisement for women.  Members of the NWP argued it was hypocritical for the United States to fight a war for democracy in Europe while denying its benefits to half of the US population. Similar arguments were being made in Europe, where most of the allied nations of Europe had enfranchised some women or soon would. After their experience with militant suffrage work in Great Britain, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns reunited in the United States in 1910. The two women originally were appointed to the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In March 1913, the two women organized the first national suffrageparade of 5,000–8,000 women (by differing estimates) in Washington, D.C. on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. This was designed as a political tactic to show the strength of women and to show that they would pursue their goals under Wilson’s administration. Leading the parade was Inez Milholland who wore all white and rode on a white horse, which later served as a symbol for the suffrage movement. This placement of Millholland at the start of the parade was strategic because of Mulholland's beauty, Paul knew she would attract media attention and followers. One of the criticisms of this first national suffrage parade was the barrier of colored women from participating side by side with white women. Even though Paul never opposed black women getting the right to vote, she barred them from marching with the white women and forced them to be in the back of the parade with the men to appease southern women. The parade quickly devolved into chaos due to violent reactions from the crowd and a lack of support by the local police. The D.C. police did little to help the suffragists; but the women were assisted by the Massachusetts National Guard, the Pennsylvania National Guard, and boys from the Maryland Agricultural College, who created a human barrier protecting the women from the angry crowd. After this incident, which Paul effectively used to rally public opinion to the suffrage cause, Paul and Burns founded the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in April 1913, which split off from NAWSA later that year. There were many reasons for the split, but primarily Paul and Burns were frustrated with the National's slower approach of focusing on individual state referendums and wanted to pursue a congressional amendment. Alice Paul had also chafed under the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt, as she had very different ideas of how to go about suffrage work, and a different attitude towards militancy. Catt disapproved of the radical strategies, inspired by the British \"Suffragettes\", Paul and Burns were trying to implement into the American Suffrage Movement. The split was confirmed by a major difference of opinion on the Shafroth-Palmer Amendment. This amendment was spearheaded by Alice Paul's replacement as chair of the National's Congressional Committee, and was a compromise of sorts meant to appease racist sentiment in the South. Shafroth–Palmer was to be a constitutional amendment that would require any state with more than 8 percent signing an initiative petition to hold a state referendum on suffrage. This would have kept the law-making out of federal hands, a proposition more attractive to the South. Southern states feared a congressional women's suffrage amendment as a possible federal encroachment into their restrictive system of voting laws, meant to disenfranchise the black voter. Paul and Burns felt that this amendment was a lethal distraction from the true and ultimately necessary goal of an all-encompassing federal amendment protecting the rights of all women—especially as the bruising rounds of state referendums were perceived at the time as almost damaging the cause. In Paul's words: \"It is a little difficult to treat with seriousness an equivocating, evasive, childish substitute for the simple and dignified suffrage amendment now before Congress.\" Women associated with the party staged a very innovative suffrage parade on March 3, 1913, the day before Wilson's inauguration. During the group's first meeting, Paul clarified that the party would not be a traditional political party and therefore would not endorse a candidate for president during elections. While non-partisan, the NWP directed most of its attention to President Woodrow Wilson and the Democrats, criticizing them as responsible for the failure to pass a constitutional amendment. As a result, in 1918, Paul ran a campaign that boycotted Democrats because of their refusal to support women's suffrage. They decided to boycott the entire party, including pro-suffrage Democrats. Eventually, the boycott of Democrats spearheaded by the NWP lead to a Republican majority in the house. The National Woman's Party continued to focus on suffrage as their main cause. It refused to either support or attack American involvement in the World War, while the rival NAWSA, under Carrie Chapman Catt gave full support to the war effort. As a result, a diverse group of activists such as pacifists and Socialists were attracted to the NWP due to its opposition to an anti-suffrage president. The escalating conflict in Europe didn’t stop Alice Paul and the NWP from protesting Wilson’s hypocritical stance on the war. Wilson promoted the idea of maintaining democracy abroad, even though the United States still denied half of its citizens the right to vote. The NWP pickets were seen as controversial because they continued during war time and other suffrage groups like NAWSA chose to support the war effort. Known as \"Silent Sentinels\", their action lasted from January 10, 1917 until June 1919. The picketers were tolerated at first, but when they continued to picket after the United States declared war in 1917, they were arrested by police for obstructing traffic. Regardless of the weather, the women stood outside of the White House holding banners, constantly reminding Wilson of his hypocrisy. When they were first arrested, Lucy Burns claimed that they were political prisoners but were treated as regular prisoners.  As a tribute to their commitment to suffrage, they refused to pay the fines  and accepted prison time. The first night that the Silent Sentinels spent in jail was known as the Night of Terror: the prisoners were beaten until a few of them were unconscious, starved, and Burns had her hands chained above her head. Due to this unlawful detention, many of the NWP's members went on hunger strikes; some, including Lucy Burns and Paul, were force-fed by jail personnel as a consequence.Hunger strikes left the women weak and in terrible conditions, but they persisted. After a while, the guards were told to force-feed the women. They had long narrow tubes shoved down their throats, which caused many injuries that failed to heal. The suffragists were also forced to provide labor in the workhouses and were often beaten and abused. Taking advantage of the mistreatment and physical abuse, some of the suffragists shared their stories to the press and to \"The Suffragist\", their suffrage newspaper. Doris Stevens, a notable member of the NWP, wrote about their horrible experiences in the Occoquan Workhouse in her memoir \"Jailed for Freedom\". The resulting publicity was at a time when Wilson was trying to build a reputation for himself and the nation as an international leader in human rights. Many of banners featured quotes from Wilson about preserving democracy abroad, which called attention to Wilson's hypocrisy and his lack of support for a national suffrage amendment. There are many different theories about why Wilson changed his stance of suffrage. Wilson favored  woman suffrage at the state level, but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided, with the South opposing an amendment on the grounds of state's rights. The only Southern state to grant women the vote was Arkansas. The NWP in 1917–1919 repeatedly targeted Wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment. Wilson, however, kept in close touch with more moderate suffragists of the NAWSA. Wilson continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was in support; the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him. In January 1918, Wilson went in person to the House and made a strong and widely published appeal to the House to pass the bill. The NWP had many innovative non-violent tactics including; staging sit-ins, organizing deputations of high class and working-class women, boycotting the Democrats in midterm elections, using the voting power of women in the west, appealing to Wilson everyday through picketing, and calling out Wilson for supporting world democracy but not supporting it at home, of the NWP were a contributing factor in getting Wilson to change his position on the suffrage bill. It passed but the Senate stalled until 1919 then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification.<a href=\"National%20Woman%27s%20Party%23cite%2520note-13\"></a> Scholar Belinda A. Stillion Southard has written that \"...the campaign of the NWP was crucial toward securing the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.\"<a href=\"National%20Woman%27s%20Party%23cite%2520note-14\"></a> The NWP played a critical role in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, which granted U.S. women the right to vote. Alice Paul then turned her attention to securing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) which she felt was vital for women to secure gender equality. The NWP regrouped in1923 and published the magazine \"Equal Rights\". The publication was directed towards women but also intended to educate men about the benefits of women's suffrage, women's rights and other issues concerning American women. Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.  The NWP did not support protective legislation and argued that these laws would continue to depress women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society. But, the NWP did support working women and their support was vital throughout their campaign for the national Amendment. Alice Paul organized many working class deputations and even sent over 400 blue collar workers to meet with Wilson. Although seen as highly controversial due to the status difference, this move showed Paul's support for all types of women, not just those of prestigious class. After 1920, the National Woman's Party authored over 600 pieces of legislation fighting for women's equality; over 300 were passed. In addition, the NWP continued to lobby for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and under president Sarah Tarleton Colvin, who served in 1933, pressed for equal pay. Scholar Mary K. Trigg has noted, \"...the NWP played a central role in the women's rights movement after 1945. It stuck to its laser-like focus on the ERA, doggedly lobbying year in and year out for the amendment's introduction in Congress.\" In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization. Instead, it turned its focus to education and to preserving its collection of first hand source documents from the women's suffrage movement. The NWP continues to function as an educational organization, maintaining and interpreting the collection left by the work of the historic National Woman's Party. Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed. However, in 1964 the NWP did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have \"sex\" added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP. In 1963 Congress passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited wage differentials based on sex. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. He was a conservative who strongly opposed civil rights laws for blacks, but he supported such laws for white women.  Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133.  Historians debate Smith's motivation—was it a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to both civil rights for blacks and women, or did he support women's rights and was attempting to improve the bill by broadening it to include women? Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions. Smith asserted that he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. Martha Griffiths, he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment. For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment—with no linkage to racial issues—in the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially Paul. She and other activists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment. Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws \"protecting\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs. The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. However, in 1964 the NWP and Pauli Murray did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have \"sex\" added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP. Pauli Murray was also instrumental in the inclusion of sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits the discrimination based on sex, which has been attributed to the betterment of women as a group. \"The Suffragist\" newspaper was founded by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in 1913. It was referred to as \"the only women's political newspaper in the United States\" and was published to promote women's suffrage activities. The Suffragist would follow weekly events and promote different views held by the leaders of the NWP. Its articles had political cartoons, by Nina E. Allender to garner support for the movement and communicate the status of the suffrage amendment. After the amendment for the women's right to vote was passed, the publication was discontinued by the National Woman's Party and succeeded in 1923 by \"Equal Rights\". Published until 1954, \"Equal Rights\" began as a weekly newsletter and evolved into a bi-monthly release aimed at keeping NWP members informed about developments related to the ERA and legislative issues. It included field reports, legislation updates and features about the activities of the NWP and featured writing from contributors including Crystal Eastman, Zona Gale, Ruth Hale and Inez Haynes Irwin. Josephine Casey appeared on the cover of the publication in April 1931 as a result of her recurring column about the labour conditions of female textile workers in Georgia. The Nineteenth amendment, which prohibits the denial of the right to vote on the basis of sex, became the law of the land when it was ratified by a sufficient number of states in 1920. Many African American women and men in the Jim Crow South, however, remained disenfranchised after the ratification of this amendment until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Today, the National Woman's Party exists as a 501c3 educational organization. Its task is now the maintenance and interpretation of the collection and archives of the historic National Woman's Party. The NWP operates out of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, DC, where objects from the collection are exhibited. The legacy that this group left behind is mixed. On one hand Alice Paul and the NWP were one of the reasons that the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, but on the other hand the party was flawed for their lack of inclusion of black women and their refusal to help black women gain the right to vote. To keep the support of southern members of the NWP, Paul refused to bring up the issue of race in the south. Her single-minded focus on the ERA caused her to refuse to fight the Jim Crow Laws barring black women the right to vote. Historian Nancy Cott has noted that as the party moved into the 1920s it remained ideologically consistent in the pursuit of a solitary goal for women and that: it remained an autocratically run, single-minded and single-issue pressure group, still reliant on getting into the newspapers as a means of publicizing its cause, very insistent on the method of \"getting in touch with the key men.\"...NWP lobbyists went straight to legislators, governors, and presidents, not to their constituents. In 1972 Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed. Even though the expiration date has passed for this Amendment, recently a few states have ratified it symbolically. Although Alice Paul didn’t live to see her hard work pay off, her legacy lives on in the continued struggle to ratify the ERA.", "Paulsdale\nPaulsdale Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, was the birthplace and childhood home of Alice Paul, a major leader in the Women's suffrage movement in the United States.

It was inspired by the United Kingdom's suffragette movement, which Paul and Burns had taken part in. Their continuous campaigning drew attention from congressmen, and in 1914 they were successful in forcing the amendment onto the floor for the first time in decades. Alice Paul created the Congressional Union after joining the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and gaining leadership of its Congressional Committee.  The CU was initiated to assist the NAWSA Congressional Committee and its officers were part of that committee.  The CU shared the same goal with NAWSA, to gain an amendment to the United States Constitution giving all women the right to vote. In the beginning, the CU worked within NAWSA to strengthen the declining Congressional Committee. In March 1913, after realizing the amount of work to be done, the CU became in charge of their own operations and funding but still remained affiliated with NAWSA. In the fall of 1913, Carrie Chapman Catt of NAWSA accused the CU of insubordination and financial irregularities, allegations which she later retracted. The strategies of the two organizations were conflicting and NAWSA's leadership felt threatened. In December 1913, the National American Woman Suffrage Association selected a new Congressional Committee and formally cut ties with the Congressional Union. The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage appealed to young women with a new approach in the fight for women's suffrage, inspired by the British suffragettes.  Alice Paul believed women should not have to beg for their rights. Paul introduced some of the militant methods used by the Women's Social and Political Union in Britain to the CU and its members. These included direct actions, organizing huge demonstrations, and the daily picketing of the White House. The CU had 4,500 members and had raised more than $50,000 in funds by 1914. Over time, the efforts of hundreds of members led to their arrest and sometimes imprisonment. The Congressional Union's headquarters were located on F Street in Washington, D.C. near the Willard Hotel in a highly visible office which they paid for themselves. They started women's \"suffrage schools\" to spread awareness about their cause and held multiple meetings each day. The CU was never organized by states or districts, but there were different branches of the organization in a number of states. The Washington headquarters was central to their work but they were also a mobile organization. The CU published a newspaper called \"The Suffragist\", featuring articles by prominent members including Alice Paul, Lucy Burns and Inez Milholland. The newspaper employed Nina Allender as its main cartoonist, and also published cartoons by artists such as Cornelia Barns, Boardman Robinson and Marietta Andrews. The Congressional Union actively campaigned for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing universal woman suffrage. Following the methods used by suffragettes in Britain, the CU fully blamed the majority party for failure to advance the Federal Suffrage Amendment. The majority party at the time was the Democratic Party, and Democrat Woodrow Wilson was president. Members traveled west and campaigned against Democrats in hopes of impeding their reelection. They even campaigned against Democrats who approved women's suffrage, despite criticism from the National American Woman Suffrage Association. They traveled through the west by train while using a number of tactics to increase their visibility and their whistle-stop speeches attracted the attention of reporters. Their campaign resulted in the defeat of 20 democrats who supported suffrage, much to the dismay of NAWSA. The Congressional Union created the National Woman's Party at a meeting in Chicago in 1916. The party included members of the Congressional Union, and Alice Paul was in charge. A Campaign Committee was formed within the party with Anne Martin serving as chairman. In 1917, the two organizations officially joined together to form the National Woman's Party (NWP) and elected Alice Paul as their chairman."], "neg": ["United States Senate Select Committee on Woman Suffrage\nUnited States Senate Select Committee on Woman Suffrage The Select Committee on Woman Suffrage was a select committee of the United States Senate from 1882-1921 It was established to consider an amendment to the United States Constitution granting women the right to vote in the United States. The Senate established the select committee on January 9, 1882, when it approved a resolution offered by Senator George Hoar of Massachusetts. The committee was directed to consider \"all petitions, bills, and resolves asking for the extension of suffrage to women or the removal of their legal disabilities.\" The first constitutional amendment granting woman suffrage was proposed January 10, 1878, by Senator Aaron Sargent of California. Similar amendments were introduced and referred to the select committee each successive Congress until 1919, when a resolution that was to become the 19th Amendment to the Constitution passed both houses of Congress. The committee became a standing committee in 1909 when Senator Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island submitted a resolution that had the effect of giving all current select committees, including Woman Suffrage, full committee status. The committee was abolished in 1921, along with many other obsolete committees. Woman suffrage leader Susan B.

Born in Middletown, Connecticut, the son of mathematician Edward Burr Van Vleck and grandson of astronomer John Monroe Van Vleck, he grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, and received an A.B. degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1920. Then he went to Harvard for graduate studies and earned a Ph.D degree in 1922. He joined the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor in 1923, then moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison before settling at Harvard. He also earned \"Honorary D. Sc.\", or \"D. Honoris Causa\", degree from Wesleyan University in 1936. J. H. Van Vleck established the fundamentals of the quantum mechanical theory of magnetism and the crystal field theory (chemical bonding in metal complexes). He is regarded as the \"Father of Modern Magnetism\". During World War II, J. H. Van Vleck worked on radar at the MIT Radiation Lab. He was half time at the Radiation Lab and half time on the staff at Harvard. He showed that at about 1.25-centimeter wavelength water molecules in the atmosphere would lead to troublesome absorption and that at 0.5-centimeter wavelength there would be a similar absorption by oxygen molecules. This was to have important consequences not just for military (and civil) radar systems but later for the new science of radioastronomy. J. H. Van Vleck participated in the Manhattan Project. In June 1942, J. Robert Oppenheimer held a summer study for confirming the concept and feasibility of a nuclear weapon at the University of California, Berkeley. Eight theoretical scientists, including J. H. Van Vleck, attended it. From July to September, the theoretical study group examined and developed the principles of atomic bomb design. J. H. Van Vleck's theoretical work led to the establishment of the Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Laboratory. He also served on the Los Alamos Review committee in 1943. The committee, established by General Leslie Groves, also consisted of W. K. Lewis of MIT, Chairman; E. L. Rose, of Jones & Lamson; E. B. Wilson of Harvard; and Richard C. Tolman, Vice Chairman of NDRC. The committee's important contribution (originating with Rose) was a reduction in the size of the firing gun for the Little Boy atomic bomb, a concept that eliminated additional design weight and sped up production of the bomb for its eventual release over Hiroshima. However, it was not employed for the Fat Man bomb at Nagasaki, which relied on implosion of a plutonium shell to reach critical mass. In 1961/62 he was George Eastman Visiting Professor at University of Oxford and held a professorship at Balliol College. In 1950 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966 and the Lorentz Medal in 1974.

Holmes or Johnny the Wadd (after the lead character he portrayed in a series of related films), was at the time he was active, one of the most prolific male adult film actors, with documented credit for at least 544 films. Holmes was best known for his exceptionally large penis, which was heavily promoted as the longest, thickest and hardest in the adult film industry, although no documented measurement of Holmes' actual penis length, girth or tumescence has ever been confirmed. Near the end of his life, Holmes attained notoriety for his reputed involvement in the Wonderland murders of July 1981 and eventually for his death from complications caused by AIDS in March 1988. Holmes was the subject of several books, a lengthy essay in \"Rolling Stone\" and two feature-length documentaries, and was the inspiration for two Hollywood movies (\"Boogie Nights\" and \"Wonderland\"). Holmes was born John Curtis Estes on August 8, 1944, in the small rural town of Ashville, Ohio, about south of Columbus. He was the youngest of four children born to 26-year-old Mary June (Barton) Holmes, but the name of his father, railroad worker Carl Estes, is left blank on his birth certificate. Mary had married Edgar Harvey Holmes, who was the father of her three older children - Dale, Edward and Anne. She and Holmes were married and divorced three times, as is documented by wedding certificates dated April 13, 1936, August 13, 1945, and September 12, 1947. At the time of their first marriage in 1936, Edgar was 35 years old and divorced, while Mary was 17. After divorcing for the third and final time, Edgar and Mary each married one more time. Mary changed John's surname to Holmes when he was a child. In 1986, when Holmes applied for a U.S. passport for the first time prior to a trip to Italy, his mother reportedly provided him with the handwritten copy of his original birth certificate, which led Holmes to learn that his biological father was Carl Estes. Holmes' mother was said to be a devout Southern Baptist and with her children regularly attended church in Millport. In contrast, his stepfather Edgar was an alcoholic who would come home inebriated, stumble about the house and even vomit on the children. As a child, Holmes enjoyed a reprieve from his turbulent home life when he visited his maternal grandparents, John W. and Bessie (née Gillenwater) Barton. Mary divorced Edgar when Holmes was a toddler and moved with her children to Columbus, where they lived in a low-income apartment project with a friend of Mary's and her own two children. The two women worked as clerks and waitresses in order to support their young children. When Holmes was age seven, his mother married Harold Bowman on December 31, 1951. Shortly afterward, Holmes and his family moved from Columbus and settled in the small town of Pataskala, about 10 miles east. Holmes recalled that Bowman was a good father until Holmes' younger half-brother David was born, at which point Bowman reportedly lost interest in his stepchildren and began neglecting them. Holmes left home at age 15 and enlisted in the U.S. Army, with his mother's written permission. He spent most of the three years of his military service in West Germany in the Signal Corps. Upon his honorable discharge in 1963, Holmes moved to Los Angeles, where he worked in a variety of jobs, including selling goods door-to-door and tending the vats at a factory. During his stint as an ambulance driver, Holmes met a nurse named Sharon Gebenini in December 1964. They married on August 21, 1965 in Monterey, California, after Holmes turned 21. In April 1965, Holmes found work as a forklift driver at a meatpacking warehouse in nearby Cudahy. However, repeated exposure to the freezing air in the large walk-in freezer after being outside inhaling the desert-hot air caused him severe health problems, leading to a pneumothorax of his right lung on three separate occasions during the two years he worked there. Sharon also had health problems, as during the first 17 months of her marriage to Holmes, she miscarried three times. In 1971, Holmes' career began to take off with an adult film series built around a private investigator named Johnny Wadd, written and directed by Bob Chinn. The success of the film \"Johnny Wadd\" created an immediate demand for follow-ups, so Chinn followed up the same year with \"Flesh of the Lotus.\" Most of the subsequent Johnny Wadd films were written and directed by Chinn and produced by the Los Angeles-based company Freeway Films. With the success of \"Deep Throat\" (1972), \"Behind the Green Door\" (1972) and \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" (1973), porn became chic, although its legality was still hotly contested. Holmes was arrested during this time for pimping and pandering, but he avoided prison time by reputedly becoming an informant for the LAPD. Holmes' \"handler\" during his time as an informant was LAPD vice detective Thomas Blake. Of his involvement with Holmes, Blake said, \"It was a pleasure working for him.\" By the late 1970s, Holmes was alleged to be earning as much as $3,000 per day as a porn performer. Around this time, his consumption of cocaine and freebasing were becoming an increasingly serious problem. Professionally, it affected his ability to maintain an erection, as is apparent from his flaccid performance in \"Insatiable\" (1980). To support himself and his drug habit, Holmes ventured into crime, selling drugs for gangs, prostituting himself to both men and women, as well as committing credit card fraud and various acts of petty theft. In 1976, Holmes met 15-year-old Dawn Schiller, whom he groomed and abused. After he became desperate for money, he forced her into prostitution and often beat her, which he did at least once in public. In the 1981 biographical feature documentary \"Exhausted, John C. Holmes, The Real Story\", from director and Holmes confidante Julia St. Vincent, Holmes claimed during an interview segment that he had intercourse with 14,000 women. The number had in fact been invented by Holmes to help salvage his waning image. The true number of women (and men) with whom Holmes had sex during his career would never be known. After his death, his ex-wife Sharon claimed to have come across a footlocker plated in 24k gold leaf, which contained photographic references to Holmes' \"private work\" and which she burned. Holmes' performances included at least one homosexual feature film, \"The Private Pleasures of John C. Holmes\", and a handful of loops which contained anal sex with men. In late 1980, a mutual friend introduced Holmes to Chris Coxx, who owned the Odyssey nightclub. In turn, Coxx introduced Holmes to Eddie Nash, a drug dealer who owned several nightclubs, including the Starwood in West Hollywood. At the same time, Holmes was closely associated with the Wonderland Gang, a group of heroin-addicted cocaine dealers, so called for the rowhouse located on Wonderland Avenue in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles, out of which they operated. Holmes frequently sold drugs for the gang. Gang members included Ronnie Lee Launius, David Clay Lind, Joy Gold Miller, Billy DeVerell, and their wheel-man, Tracy McCourt. After using more than his share of the gang's drugs, Holmes was in trouble with the gang. In June 1981, Holmes told the gang's leaders, David Clay Lind and Ron Launius, about a large stash of drugs, money and jewelry Nash had in his house. Holmes helped to set up a home invasion and armed robbery that was committed on the morning of June 29, 1981. Although Holmes was not present during the robbery, Nash apparently suspected he had a part in it. After forcing Holmes to confess to his participation and threatening his life and those of Holmes' family, Nash dispatched enforcers and Holmes to exact revenge against the gang. In the early hours of July 1, 1981, four of the gang's members were found murdered and a fifth severely battered and near death in their rowhouse. Holmes was allegedly present during the murders and left a left palm print (not \"bloody\" as Los Angeles media outlets covering the story erroneously reported) over one victim's headboard, but it is unclear whether he participated in the killings. Holmes was questioned but was released due to lack of evidence; he refused to cooperate with the investigation. After spending nearly five months on the run with Schiller, Holmes was arrested in Florida on December 4, 1981 by former LAPD homicide detectives Frank Tomlinson and Tom Lange (who later gained fame for his involvement in the O. J. Simpson murder case). Holmes was extradited to Los Angeles, and in March 1982, he was charged with personally committing all four murders. After a three-week trial, he was acquitted of all charges except committing contempt of court on June 26, 1982. The murder trial was a landmark in the history of American trial procedure, as it was the first in which videotape was introduced as evidence. After his release from Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court in November 1982, Holmes quickly resumed his film career with a new generation of porn stars. His drug addiction continued off-and-on, and although work was still plentiful, it was no longer as lucrative as it had been with the advent of cheaply made videotapes that saturated the porn market. Most of the feature porn films and videos he made during the 1980s were little more than cameo appearances. In February 1986, five or six months after testing negative, Holmes was diagnosed as HIV-positive. According to his second wife Laurie Holmes, he claimed that he never used hypodermic needles and that he was deathly afraid of them. Gebenini and friend/former colleague Bill Amerson separately confirmed later that Holmes could not have contracted HIV from intravenous drug use because he never used needles. During the summer of 1986, Holmes was offered a lucrative deal from Paradise Visuals, which was unaware he was HIV-positive, to travel to Italy to film what were to be his last two pornographic films. Holmes' penultimate film was \"The Rise of the Roman Empress\" (originally released in Italy as \"Carne bollente\") for director Riccardo Schicchi. The film starred Holmes, the later Italian Parliament member Ilona \"Cicciolina\" Staller, Tracey Adams, Christoph Clark, and Amber Lynn. His final film was \"The Devil In Mr. Holmes\", starring Adams, Lynn, Karin Schubert, and Marina Hedman. These last films created a furor when it was revealed later that Holmes had consciously chosen not to reveal his HIV status to his co-stars before engaging in unprotected sex for the filming. Not wanting to reveal the true nature of his failing health, Holmes claimed to the press that he was suffering from colon cancer. Holmes married Laurie Rose on January 23, 1987 in Las Vegas after confiding to her that he had AIDS. During the last five months of his life, he remained in the VA hospital on Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles. On March 13, 1988, at age 43, Holmes died from AIDS-related complications, which per his death certificate, were described as cardiorespiratory arrest and encephalitis due to AIDS, associated with lymphadenopathy and esophageal candidiasis. His body was cremated, and his widow, Laurie, and mother, Mary, scattered his ashes at sea off the coast of Oxnard, California.  Despite the notoriety and infamy associated with Holmes, he devoted significant time to charities involving the environment. He was involved with Greenpeace and was known to campaign and collect door-to-door for charities such as Save the Whales and Save the Seals. Holmes enjoyed clay sculpting, woodworking, and outdoor activities such as visiting beaches, camping, fishing, and hiking. Holmes' signature asset in the porn business was his exceptionally large penis. No definitive measurement or documentation verifying his penis' length or girth exists, leaving its exact size unknown. Holmes was uncircumcised. Veteran porn actress Dorothiea \"Seka\" Patton has said that Holmes' penis was the biggest in the industry and in the documentary film \"Exhausted\" she described oral sex with Holmes as similar to fellating a telephone pole. Holmes' first wife recalled his claiming to be when he first measured himself. On another occasion, Holmes claimed his penis was long and in circumference. Holmes' long-time friend and industry associate, Bill Amerson, said, \"I saw John measure himself several times; it was 13 and a half inches [34.3 cm].\" In contrast, medical studies of human penis size have consistently found erections average between about 5 and 6 inches. So celebrated was the size of Holmes' penis that it was used as a promotional tool for films in which he did not even appear. The film \"Anybody But My Husband\" ran a promotional tag line of, \"Tony 'The Hook' Perez has a dick so big he gives John Holmes a run for his money.\" At the height of his career, Holmes claimed to have had his penis insured by Lloyd's of London for $14 million. Holmes reveled in claiming he was insured \"for $1 million an inch\". Another controversy was regarding whether Holmes ever achieved a full erection, although much of his early work clearly revealed he was able to achieve a substantial erection. A popular joke in the 1970s porn industry held that Holmes was incapable of achieving a full erection because the blood flow from his head into his penis would cause him to pass out. Fellow film actress Annette Haven stated that his penis was never particularly hard during intercourse, likening it to \"doing it with a big, soft kind-of loofah\". After Holmes' death, the length of his penis continued to be used to market Holmes-related material. For example, at the premiere of the film \"Wonderland\" (2003), patrons were given 13-inch rulers as gag gifts. In 1979, along with his younger half-brother David Bowman, Holmes opened a Los Angeles locksmith shop managed by Bowman and an attached used goods store called The Just Looking Emporium, named by Gebinini and managed by Schiller. However, because of Holmes' escalating drug addiction, which distracted him from buying inventory for the Emporium and siphoned its working capital, the Emporium \"close[d] its doors forever by the end of September 1980\". According to Schiller, \"David [kept] his part of the business open while John remove[d] our inventory and [sold] it all for coke.\" Later, after Holmes' acquittal, he and Amerson founded and operated Penguin Productions, where Holmes could be a triple-threat: writing, directing and performing. Holmes appeared in seven of Penguin's 20 productions between 1985 and 1988. After requesting permission to use the name \"Johnny Wadd\" from his old director and friend Bob Chinn, Holmes reprised the role for Penguin's \"The Return of Johnny Wadd\" (1986) – one of his last films. Holmes' career was promoted with a series of outrageous claims that he made over the years (many made up on the spur of the moment by Holmes himself). The most dubious ones include: Productions in the \"Johnny Wadd\" series:  Other significant performances:"], "neg": ["J. B. Holmes\nJ. B. Holmes John Bradley \"J.B.\" Holmes (born April 26, 1982) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. Holmes, born in Campbellsville, Kentucky, began to play on the varsity golf team at Taylor County High School in Campbellsville when he was in the third grade. He suffered a mild form of dyslexia when in school. Holmes' childhood friend, Brandon Parsons, is his caddy. While in high school he played on the Pepsi Junior Golf Tour. He attended the University of Kentucky in Lexington, helping to achieve SEC Title while there, and represented the United States in the 2005 Walker Cup before turning professional later that year. Holmes was medalist at the 2005 PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament. He tied for tenth in his first PGA Tour start at the 2006 Sony Open in Hawaii and in February that year he won the FBR Open, making him the fastest golfer to reach $1,000,000 in career earnings on the PGA Tour. It was his fifth tournament as a professional and his fourth on the PGA Tour. After this victory his form fell away, and this continued in 2007 when he made only 2 top ten finishes and ended the year in 118th place on the money list. On February 3, 2008, Holmes won the FBR Open for the second Tour win of his career and also captured the tournament title for the second time in three years. Starting the final round with a four shot lead, on the 18th tee he was one shot behind Phil Mickelson. Holmes birdied the 18th to force a play-off and then defeated Mickelson on the first playoff hole (the 18th) by making a six-foot birdie putt after a 359-yard drive. This victory took Holmes to 62nd in the Official World Golf Ranking. In 2008, Holmes reached a career-high 42nd in the OWGR. Holmes, along with fellow 2006 rookies such as Camilo Villegas and Bubba Watson, is known for hitting the ball long distances, in excess of 300 yards (312.7 yards, ranking him number 2 in driving distance, only 6 yards behind the leader, Watson). As such, he plays courses by routinely hitting his driver as far as he can, reminiscent of John Daly's \"Grip it and Rip It\" philosophy, and using his distance advantage to put him closer to the green and in position for a wedge or short iron to the green. While the style of play is not new, many critics have complained that J.B. Holmes's style has ushered in a new wave of golfers dedicated to smashing the ball as far as they can, assisted by the newer golf equipment offered by golf club companies and hacking the ball out of the rough onto the green, effectively eliminating the equalizing effect that the sport of golf usually affords shorter, accurate hitters. In the 2008 Ryder Cup, Holmes defeated Europe's Søren Hansen 2&1 during Sunday's singles matches to bring the United States within one point of clinching the Ryder Cup. Jim Furyk would later defeat Miguel Ángel Jiménez on the 17th hole to clinch the Ryder Cup. Holmes and another Ryder Cup teammate, Kenny Perry, were named Kentuckians of the Year for 2008 by \"Kentucky Monthly\" magazine. After shooting an 80 in the first round, Holmes withdrew from the 2011 PGA Championship in August. He had been dealing with vertigo symptoms for several months and eventually was diagnosed with structural defects in the cerebellum known as Chiari malformations. He underwent brain surgery on September 1, 2011, and about a month later, doctors discovered later that Holmes was allergic to the adhesive used on the webbed titanium plate at the base of his skull. He was airlifted from his home in Kentucky to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore for another surgery. Holmes returned to the PGA Tour in late January 2012 at the Farmers Insurance Open. After brain surgery, Holmes played in 26 events in 2012. Elbow and ankle injuries limited him to six PGA Tour events in 2013 and did not play again until the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament on the Japan Golf Tour. Holmes satisfied his medical extension through earnings at the 2014 Zurich Classic of New Orleans, finishing T11. He would need a T63 at the Wells Fargo Championship to earn entry into the 2014 Players Championship via FedEx Cup points. Holmes would get his first win in six years, regained his Tour status through the 2015-2016 season, and moved from 242nd to 68th in the Official World Golf Ranking. The win also earned Holmes entry into the 2014 PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 2015, Holmes lost in a four-man sudden-death playoff at the Farmers Insurance Open. He held a co-lead after the 54-hole stage with Harris English, but could only shoot a level-par final round to enter the playoff. At the first playoff hole, Holmes made a birdie to move on to the second playoff hole with Jason Day, after English and Scott Stallings were eliminated with pars. On the par-three second playoff hole, Holmes flew the green and could not get down in two from the back rough, leaving Day with two putts from 15 feet for the victory. In the first round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship, Holmes shot a 62 for a total of 10-under-par to lead by four strokes after the first day. His round included eight birdies and an eagle to tie the tournament record. Holmes retained his lead after the second round, despite a one-over-par 73. He led by two shots going into the weekend and opened up a five-shot lead following a 70 in the third round, which included a hole-in-one at the par-3 fourth hole. However his lead had gone by the sixth hole in the final round, after he bogeyed three of his opening six holes. Holmes played the rest of his round in even-par and would go on to shoot a 75 to finish one behind winner Dustin Johnson. His runner-up finish moved Holmes to 19th in the world rankings, his highest ever placing to date. In January 2018, Holmes was criticized by his fellow pros on social media after taking four minutes and ten seconds over his second shot to the 18th hole in the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open. Holmes needed an eagle to get into a playoff but eventually laid up. Holmes later said he was 'shocked' by the negative reaction to incident, comments that sparked another backlash. Fellow pro Justin Thomas defended Holmes though, saying he would have done the exact same had he been in his position.
