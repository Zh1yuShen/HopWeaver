{"query": "Great Depression global causes instead of New Zealand banking failures", "pos": ["Depression (economics)\nDepression (economics) In economics, a depression is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies. It is a more severe economic downturn than a recession, which is a slowdown in economic activity over the course of a normal business cycle. A depression is an unusual and extreme form of recession. Depressions are characterized by their length, by abnormally large increases in unemployment, falls in the availability of credit (often due to some form of banking or financial crisis), shrinking output as buyers dry up and suppliers cut back on production and investment, large number of bankruptcies including sovereign debt defaults, significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce (especially international trade), as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations (often due to currency devaluations). Price deflation, financial crises and bank failures are also common elements of a depression that do not normally occur during a recession. In the United States the National Bureau of Economic Research determines contractions and expansions in the business cycle, but does not declare depressions. Generally, periods labeled depressions are marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced using current resources and technology (potential output). Another proposed definition of \"depression\" includes two general rules: There are also differences in the duration of depression across definitions. Some economists refer only to the period when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until economic activity has returned close to normal levels. A recession is briefly defined as a period of declining economic activity spread across the economy (according to NBER). Under the first definition, each depression will always coincide with a recession, since the difference between a depression and a recession is the severity of the fall in economic activity. In other words, each depression is always a recession, sharing the same starting and ending dates and having the same duration. Under the second definition, depressions and recessions will always be distinct events however, having the same starting dates. This definition of depression implies that a recession and a depression will have different ending dates and thus distinct durations. Under this definition, the length of a depression will always be longer than that of the recession starting the same date. A useful example is the difference in the chronology of the Great Depression in the U.S. under the view of alternative definitions. Using the second definition of depression, most economists refer to the Great Depression, as the period between 1929 and 1941. On the other hand, using the first definition, the depression that started in August 1929 lasted until March 1933. Note that NBER, which publishes the recession (instead of depression) dates for the U.S. economy, has identified two recessions during that period. The first between August 1929 and March 1933 and the second starting in May 1937 and ending in June 1938. Today the term \"depression\" is most often associated with the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the term had been in use long before then. Indeed, an early major American economic crisis, the Panic of 1819, was described by then-president James Monroe as \"a depression\", and the economic crisis immediately preceding the 1930s depression, the Depression of 1920–21, was referred to as a \"depression\" by president Calvin Coolidge. However, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, \"financial\" crises were traditionally referred to as \"panics\", e.g., the 'major' Panic of 1907, and the 'minor' Panic of 1910–1911, though the 1929 crisis was more commonly called \"The Crash\", and the term \"panic\" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression (of the 1930s), the phrase \"The Great Depression\" had already been used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has since been renamed the Long Depression. Common use of the phrase \"The Great Depression\" for the 1930s crisis is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins, whose 1934 book \"The Great Depression\" is credited with 'formalizing' the phrase, though US president Herbert Hoover is widely credited with having 'popularized' the term/phrase, informally referring to the downturn as a \"depression\", with such uses as \"Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement\", (December 1930, Message to Congress) and \"I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression\" (1931). Due to the lack of an agreed definition and the strong negative associations, the characterization of any period as a \"depression\" is contentious. The term was frequently used for regional crises from the early 19th century until the 1930s, and for the more widespread crises of the 1870s and 1930s, but economic crises since 1945 have generally been referred to as \"recessions\", with the 1970s global crisis referred to as \"stagflation\", but not a depression. The only two eras commonly referred to at the current time as \"depressions\" are the 1870s and 1930s. To some degree this is simply a stylistic change, similar to the decline in the use of \"panic\" to refer to financial crises, but it does also reflect that the economic cycle – both in the United States and in most OECD countries – though not in all – has been more moderate since 1945. There \"have\" been many periods of prolonged economic underperformance in particular countries/regions since 1945, detailed below, but terming these as \"depressions\" is controversial. The current economic cycle, which has comprised the most significant global crisis since the Great Depression, has at times been termed a depression, but this terminology is not widely used, with the episode instead being referred to by other terms, such as the \"Great Recession\". The Panic of 1837 was an American financial crisis, built on a speculative real estate market. The bubble burst on May 10, 1837 in New York City, when every bank stopped payment in gold and silver coinage. The Panic was followed by a five-year depression, with the failure of banks and record high unemployment levels. Starting with the adoption of the gold standard in Britain and the United States, the Long Depression (1873–1896) was indeed longer than what is now referred to as the Great Depression, but shallower. However, it was known as \"the Great Depression\" until the 1930s. The best-known depression was the Great Depression, which affected most national economies in the world throughout the 1930s. This depression is generally considered to have begun with the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and the crisis quickly spread to other national economies. Between 1929 and 1933, the gross national product of the United States decreased by 33% while the rate of unemployment increased to 25% (with industrial unemployment alone rising to approximately 35% – U.S. employment was still over 25% agricultural).  A long-term effect of the Great Depression was the departure of every major currency from the gold standard, although the initial impetus for this was World War II (see Bretton Woods Accord). In any case, the world economy has simply outgrown the capacity of additions to the world gold supply to accommodate the increase in world population and increased trade without periodic, painful revaluations of any currencies tied to gold. Beginning in 2009, Greece sank into a recession that, after two years, became a depression. The country saw an almost 20% drop in economic output, and unemployment soared to near 25%. Greece's high amounts of sovereign debt precipitated the crisis, and the poor performance of its economy since the introduction of severe austerity measures has slowed the entire eurozone's recovery. Greece's continuing troubles have led to discussions about its departure from the eurozone. The late 1910s and early 1920s were marked by an economic depression that unraveled in particularly catastrophic circumstances: The Great War and its aftermath led to a global nosedive in commodities that ruined many developing nations, while servicemen returning from the trenches found themselves with high unemployment as businesses failed, unable to transition into a peacetime economy. Also, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-20 brought economic activity to a standstill as even more people became incapacitated. Most developed countries had mostly recovered by 1921-22, however Germany saw its economy crippled until 1923-24 because of the hyperinflation crisis. The 1973 oil crisis, coupled with the rising costs of maintenance of welfare state in most countries led to a recession between 1973 and 1975, followed by a period of almost minimal growth and rising inflation and unemployment. The 1980-82 recession marked the end of the period. The savings & loans and the leveraged buyout crises led to a severe depression in mid-to-late 1989, causing a recession in 1990-91 (also fueled by the oil price crisis), whose effects lasted as late as 1994. This downturn is more remembered for its political effects: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had to resign in November 1990 as a result of the socioeconomic debacle caused by her later policies; and while his approval ratings were above 60%, U.S. President George H. W. Bush lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton because of the domestic malady marked by the depression and increasing urban decay. In 2005, the persistent oil price rises and economic overheating caused by deregulation led to a gradual deterioration of the world economy with inflation and unemployment rising as growth slowed down: The housing bubble in the U.S. burst in 2007, and the American economy slipped into a recession. This in turn provoked the failure of many prominent financial institutions throughout 2008, most notably Lehman Brothers, leading to the loss of millions of jobs. Several Latin American countries had severe downturns in the 1980s: by the Kehoe and Prescott definition of a great depression as at least one year with output 20% below trend, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico experienced great depressions in the 1980s, and Argentina experienced another in 1998–2002. South American countries fell once again into this in the early-to-mid 2010s as a result of falling prices of commodities such as in the 1980s, with the economies of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela falling into recession as massive government spending further strained their financial situation. This definition also includes the economic performance of New Zealand from 1974–1992 and Switzerland from 1973 to the present, although this designation for Switzerland has been controversial. Over the period 1980–2000, Sub-Saharan Africa broadly suffered a fall in absolute income levels. The economic crisis in the 1990s that struck former members of the Soviet Union was almost twice as intense as the Great Depression in the countries of Western Europe and the United States in the 1930s. Average standards of living registered a catastrophic fall in the early 1990s in many parts of the former Eastern Bloc, most notably in post-Soviet states. Even before Russia's financial crisis of 1998, Russia's GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s. Some populations are still poorer today than they were in 1989 (e.g. Ukraine, Moldova, Serbia, Central Asia, Caucasus). The collapse of the Soviet planned economy and the transition to market economy resulted in catastrophic declines in GDP of about 45% during the 1990–1996 period and poverty in the region had increased more than tenfold. Finnish economists refer to the Finnish economic decline around the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989–1994) as a great depression (\"suuri lama\"). However, the depression was multicausal, with its severity compounded by a coincidence of multiple sudden external shocks, including loss of Soviet trade, the savings and loan crisis and early 1990s recession in the West, with the internal overheating that had been brewing throughout the 1980s. Liberalization had resulted in the so-called \"casino economy\". Persistent structural and monetary policy problems had not been solved, leaving the economy vulnerable to even mild external shocks. The depression had lasting effects: the Finnish markka was floated and was eventually replaced by the euro in 1999, ending decades of government control of the economy, but also high, persistent unemployment. Employment has never returned even close to pre-crisis level."], "neg": ["Great Recession in Oceania\nGreat Recession in Oceania Great Recession in Oceania is an article on the recession affecting the Oceanic region. This includes, Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific countries. Australia is one of the three Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that did not experience two consecutive negative quarters of growth and one of the two that avoided negative year-end GDP growth during the global recession. It was not affected by the crisis from 2008 to 2009 due to a number of factors such as government stimulus spending; its proximity to the booming Chinese economy and the related mining boom kept growth ticking over throughout the worst of the global conditions. In fact, sources such as the IMF and the Reserve Bank of Australia had predicted Australia was well positioned to weather the crisis with minimal disruption, sustaining more than 2% GDP growth in 2009 (as many Western nations went into recession). In the same year, the World Economic Forum ranked Australia's banking system the fourth best in the world, while the Australian dollar's 30% drop was seen as a boon for trade, shielding the country from the crisis and helping to slow growth and consumption. Australia's recession affected New Zealand's economy as Australia was New Zealand's biggest export market. It is said that the term Great Recession as a description of the post-2008 slump is not recognized by Australians particularly those under 30 due to its mild impact on the country's economy. Some analysts had predicted the continuing decline of trade in 2009 could put the economy into recession for the first time in 17 years. However, these initial fears were proved largely unfounded as the Australian economy avoided recession and the unemployment rate peaked at a much lower rate than had been predicted. To help address the anticipated slowdown, the Australian government also announced a stimulus package worth $27 billion to spur economic growth while the Reserve Bank of Australia introduced a series of interest rate cuts. The New Zealand Treasury defines \"recession\" as \"consecutive falls in real GDP.\" The department said that New Zealand's real GDP fell 3.3% between the December 2007 quarter and the March 2008 quarter, and that this start, before any other OECD nation, was the result of domestic factors. It said that New Zealand's recession was among the first to finish and was one of the shallowest. New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's quarterly survey showed New Zealand's economy contracted 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2008. There was a substantial number of finance company collapses between 2006 and 2012. Housing starts in New Zealand fell 20 percent in June 2008, the lowest levels since 1986. Excluding apartments, approvals dropped 13 percent from May. Approvals in the year ended June fell 12 percent from a year earlier. Second-quarter approvals dropped 19 percent. The figures suggested a decrease in construction and economic growth. House sales fell 42 percent in June from a year earlier. The New Zealand Treasury concluded that the country's economy had contracted for a second quarter based on economic indicators, putting New Zealand in a recession. New Zealand's central bank cut rates by half a percent arguing the economy was in recession. New Zealand's GDP declined by 0.2 percent in the second quarter putting the country in its first recession in a decade. The economy emerged from recession in mid-2009, with the second-quarter GDP report showing the economy grew by 0.1 per cent on the March quarter.", "Great Depression in Latin America\nGreat Depression in Latin America The Great Depression which followed the US stock market crash of 1929 badly affected the countries of Latin America. Chile, Peru, and Bolivia were, according to a League of Nations report, the countries worst-hit by the Great Depression. The rise of fascism also became apparent in Latin American countries in the 1930s due to the Great Depression. Fascist governments were the result of a desire for nationalism, which rulers like Getúlio Vargas of Brazil played on through propaganda. Haiti, for its part, came out of the Great Depression as an independent country after the US pulled out their troops in 1936. In Brazil and in other Latin American countries such as Mexico, responses to the Great Depression also led to a strengthening of the industrialization process (begun in the nineteenth century). Brazil needed an economic alternative to the highly devalued coffee, its main commodity at the time. The Vargas government started to purchase and burn coffee from the farmers, in order to avoid their complete bankruptcy.", "Economic history of New Zealand\nEconomic history of New Zealand The economic history of New Zealand dates to before European colonisation of the country. By the 20th century, it had become one of the most globalized economies in the world, relying heavily on international trade with developed countries including Australia, Canada, China, European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea. It is a mixed economy that functions on free-market principles and has a sizable manufacturing and service sector and an efficient agricultural sector. New Zealand has the 54th largest export economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product. In 2016, New Zealand exported a total of NZ$ 35.1billion and exported a total of NZ$ 35.4 billion, with its top exports being concentrated milk and the top imports being cars. New Zealand has an extremely diverse market economy with a sizable service sector that accounted for 63% of all GDP in 2013. Other industries including mining, manufacturing, waste services, electricity and gas accounted for 16.5% of GDP in 2013 while the primary sector only accounted for 6.5% of GDP, despite continually dominating New Zealand's exports. The biggest capital market for New Zealand is known as the New Zealand Exchange. As of June 2018 the NZX had listed over 300 securities with a market capitalization of NZD $164.5 billion. The economy of New Zealand has been listed as first in the world for Social Progression, a societal tracker that watches areas such as Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, and the level of Opportunity provided to its residents. However, New Zealand's economy used to be much stronger than it is today. During the 1970s, the New Zealand income level was higher than it was in many of the other countries in Western Europe leading up to the oil shock crisis of this time. Due to the fact that income levels dropped in relative terms and have yet to be able to fully recover, the percentage of New Zealand citizens living in poverty has skyrocketed and there have been further increases in income inequality. Furthermore, New Zealand has dealt with current account deficit issues since the crisis of the 1970s with these deficits peaking in 2006 at -7.8% of GDP, but falling back down to -2.6% of GDP in 2014. Regardless of this, the outstanding government debt, in 2014, stood at 38.4% of GDP and between 1984 and 2006, the debt owed to foreign investors increased 11 times to a total of NZ$ 182 billion. Undeterred by the current account deficit problems, the difference on external goods and service has typically shown positive gains in the economy. In the 2014 fiscal year exports outpaced imports by NZ$ 3.9 billion.  Over the last half-century, the government of New Zealand has been able to transform the country from an agrarian-based economy, that was extremely reliant upon the British for access to their markets, to an industrialized, free economy that is able to compete with other highly developed countries on the global scale. Prior to the market crash in 2007, per capita incomes had risen steadily for 10 consecutive years and then receded in 2008 and 2009. However, for the first half of the decade debt-driven spending had driven growth and this, in turn, caused the central bank to continuously raise its key rate from 2004-2008, at which point it was among the highest in the OCED. New Zealand remains focused on expanding its free trade network as a top foreign policy priority as they were one of the earliest backing parties for the Trans Pacific Partnership and the second country to ratify it. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans in New Zealand, the land was occupied by the Maori. The Maori were Polynesian tribes that had built perennial establishments and exploited the natural resources of the land in order to provide themselves with a way of life. It was around the 15th century that exploitation of these resources slowed down, and the economy went with it. The use of capital during this time, such as clearing forests and building houses, was just enough to cover the population growth and minimal use of capital means that there was little total per-capita economic growth. Some of this slow growth can be attributed to natural events such as; volcanoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and droughts. It was the warfare between the tribes that kept the economy going during these years as the construction and re-construction of fortifications would have used energy and resources from the tribes.  It was not until the Europeans arrived bringing with them new technologies, ideas, plants, animals, and sources of capital that economic growth was seen in the New Zealand lands again. Many of these European colonies were reliant upon the Maori for food and the Maori obliged by providing the foreigners with goods from their lands. The Maori were keen to trade with the new arrivals and typically bartered with potatoes, corn, and flax for weapons, alcohol, tobacco and most importantly - European tools and products. The relationships between the Maori and the Europeans did not last more than a few decades as the European towns and villages became increasingly self-sustaining and by usurping the fertile lands which the Maori used to grow their crops. By the 1830s, money was becoming widely used among the Maori and it was shortly after this that banks were established in the area. Banks in New Zealand made a quick entry into society after the Europeans arrived. The first one, The Union Bank of Australia, made its first appearance in Britannia in 1840. It did not take long for others to follow suit and soon there were a large number of banks, state and foreign-owned, that emerged. At first, there was no central authority to regulate or administer the currency and so all banks operated independently and issued their own currency. Today, banks must be registered with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which the nation's central bank and issues all the currency. In 1851 the government opened the Colonial Bank of Issue which held the power and ability to issue banknotes, but this did not last long and the bank was closed in 1856. Infrastructure was something that was desperately needed in the young civilization as necessities required to support the economy and society had to be built from the ground up. It was during the 1860s that the settlers began to quarry for a variety of minerals, including gold. Towns and settlements sprung up and flourished near these quarrying sites and the gave the economy a temporary boost as resources were used up and the locals benefited from the business they received. There were long-term benefits from this quarrying as well as the desperately needed roads, railways, ports, and factories were put in place as people moved from site to site. Gold quickly became the most significant depletable resource of the 19th century in New Zealand. In the 1860s alone, gold export receipts contributed more to the economy than wool did and totalled £46 million by 1890. The gold resource in its entirety was a relatively small one in the world market, but New Zealand was also an extremely small economy in the 1860s.  This boom in the economy allowed Dunedin to become the richest of the New Zealand cities by 1880s, but the citizens soon found they would need another source of capital as the mineral quarrying was largely depleted by the end of the century. The amount of capital the settlers had was declining as they had mainly relied on the capital they had brought with them, upon their arrival, to sustain themselves. Settlements realized there would need to be another product which could be exported to generate revenue to pay for the upkeep of infrastructure and repay their debts. Wool became New Zealand's first large export staple, exported from the Wellington settlement towards the end of the 1850s. New Zealand began to produce and export staple goods at a rapid pace and it helped shape society as well as establish a tone for economic growth, none of which would have happened without the invention of refrigeration in 1882. This new technology allowed New Zealand to export frozen products such as meats and dairy to markets that had been thought of as unreachable. The economy relied largely on the exportation of dairy, meat and wool for the next 100 years. From the late 1870s to the mid-1890s, New Zealand experienced a depression that was the result of quarrying a finite amount of resources. The depression was foreshadowed by the closing of the City Bank of Glasgow in 1878, which in turn led to a reduction of credit that was available to New Zealand. Many farmers lost their homes and lands and turned to \"sweating\" in the factories because of a lack of jobs for rural workers. Fewer immigrants arrived as people began emigrating to Australia. In 1888 there were 10,000 more people that left New Zealand than arrived and during the years of the depression, 1881-1890, the overall gain from migration was just 40,000. It was not until the 1930s that New Zealand established its own central bank titled The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, it was established in 1934 and was constituted under the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act of 1989 with its primary purpose being to provide \"stability in the general level of prices\". Before then, all monetary policy was decided in the United Kingdom and New Zealand Pound, which was the currency until 1967, was issued by independent, private banks. One of the very first measures the new central bank took was to give itself the ability to implement its own economic agenda as it saw fit and quickly took strides to better defend the economy and people from the world markets.  By the middle of the century, pastoral products made up over 90% of the country's exports with more than 60% of that going towards the British market, which established a heavy reliance upon Britain for access to its markets. Growth and production were strong and consistent beginning in 1935 following the Great Depression and lasting through the Second World War as both men and women worked outside of the home to contribute to the war. The economy slowed down following the end of the war, but surged again from the 1950s through the 1960s and was brought about by high demand for pastoral products and a labor force that was growing fast enough to fit right into the growing manufacturing sector. Trading had never been better for New Zealand and prices skyrocketed for virtually all of their exporting products, which meant that New Zealand was quickly climbing up the income rankings. During the 1950s, the income per-capita in New Zealand was 88% of that in the United States. This was helped by tough import controls, which gave the local manufacturers the ability to manufacturer nearly identical products locally, expand their factories and operations, and compete against the much higher priced imports. The Reserve Bank's primary role during this time was to implement and handle the effects of the fluctuations in government spending as the inflation rates remained low through the end of the 1960s.  The 1950s were exceptionally prosperous for New Zealand, but it was evident that Britain was beginning to look elsewhere in Europe for trading partners. This meant that New Zealand would have to struggle for access to the markets it once supplied with its products, especially once the United Kingdom joined the EEC in 1973 and all trade agreements with New Zealand officially came to an end. At the end of 1966, the price of wool was cut by 40% as it was replaced by a synthetic fiber and this posed a large issue for New Zealand as wool was one of its top exports and the entire economy underwent a diversification period as its solution.  New Zealand began looking for an alternative source of capital via exporting goods as it was no longer able to trade with Britain. The loss of wool in 1966 and the depression of dairy and meat prices meant that change had to happen fast if the economy was to still operate at a functioning level. Through the 1960s, New Zealand had operated by exporting pastoral products such as dairy, meat, and wool. By 2008 the single biggest export good was tourism, bringing in over a quarter of the total export revenue and in 2017 export goods had increased another NZ$ 406 million. Other forms of diversification are still present; pharmaceuticals, milk powders and fine wool garments.  New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon was the face behind the Think Big strategy that was implemented during his time at the head of the National party. This strategy was devised to establish 400,000 jobs, following the second oil shock in 1979, and push New Zealand toward being self-sufficient in the energy sector. Massive industrial plants were built on New Zealand's natural gas reserves and a wide variety of new products for export such as ammonia, urea fertilizer, methanol, and petrol were produced. However, bad timing struck and many of these projects were available for use right as oil prices hit the ground, dropping from US$ 90 a barrel to US$30 a barrel within a few years. Due to these Think Big projects requiring capital to get started, the public debt shot through the roof from NZ$4.2 billion to a staggering NZ$ 21.9 billion 9 years later when Muldoon left the position of Prime Minister. It has been speculated that these debts have cost taxpayers over NZ$ 7 billion since the early 1980s. Between the years of 1984 and 1990, New Zealand underwent a period of large reform on the components that guide the economy and public administration. These reforms are sometimes referred to as Rogernomics, named after the Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, who carried them out. There were a large number of changes to the economy and how it was run during Douglas' time as Minister of Finance, some of the changes included making the Reserve Bank independent of political decisions, subsidy-free agriculture, loosening import regulations, removing controls on interest rates, and more. These changes continued to be implemented under two different governments, helping to solve a wide range of economic restructuring and governmental problems, as well as generating a substantial amount of social change. New Zealand relied heavily on privatization to help with its reform period by selling off telecommunications, airlines, computing services, government printing offices, and many others. The government decided that many agencies in the economy should be viewed as profit-making and tax-paying enterprises. New Zealand's economy entered into the longest period of significant growth in 1998 and lasted until 2006. This growth came as a result of a newly diversified and deregulated economy and benefitted the economy a great deal. For the first time in history, New Zealand was running long-term fiscal surpluses in the OCED and unemployment had fallen to never before seen levels. Despite these improvements, the country remained stagnant on the international income ranking level due to higher interest rates stemming from an unwillingness to save. Nonetheless, New Zealand is still a top choice for foreign investors which totalled NZ$107.69 billion in 2014, a statistic which has increased more than 1,000 times over since 1989 when foreign investment totalled NZ$ 9.7 billion.  Since the 1980s, New Zealand has gone from being one of the most heavily regulated economies in the OCED to one of the least regulated and most free market economy. Projecting an increase in growth of 3% for 2018, OCED believes that steady growth \"will continue to be driven by strong tourism demand from Asia and increases in dairy exports\". The stock market continues to show strong growth as well, rising 22% in 2017, held up by the economy growing at a rate that is above its long-term trend. GDP is forecasted to increase as well due to strong tourism growth, low-interest rates, and high net migration. Strong economic performance in the near term would greatly benefit New Zealand, but demand from government spending could be weaker than projected if the implementation of policy is slower than expected.", "Panic of 1930\nPanic of 1930 The Panic of 1930 was a financial crisis that occurred in the United States which led to a severe decline in the money supply during a period of declining economic activity. A series of bank failures from agricultural areas during this time period sparked panic among depositors which led to widespread bank runs across the country. The increase in the amount of hard cash held in lieu of deposits lowered the money multiplier effect which lowered the money supply and spending, dragging economic growth for the years to come. The lack of expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board coupled with such deteriorating financial and economic situation exacerbated the recession into what became known as the Great Contraction and later the Great Depression. Most of the failed banks were because of the stock market crash of 1929. National banks accounted for less than 1/6 of the total bank failures and less than 1/4 were members of the Federal Reserve System.  Caldwell and Company stands as a notable bank failure given its prominence as the “Morgan of the South” owed to its role as a leading investment bank with a half-billion dollars worth of financial interests that include a number of insurance companies, industrial enterprises, and the region’s largest bank chain. When Caldwell collapsed, its correspondent network of financial interests failed as well. Its collapse sparked further demand for currency from banks in affected regions. The Federal Reserve, created in 1913 in response to the Panic of 1907, did not expand national money supply during this time period. The regional Federal Reserve Banks took different approaches to the panic. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis followed the real bills doctrine and did not open the discount window to its member banks in trouble following the collapse of Caldwell and Company. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta opened the discount window to solvent member banks which had illiquid securities and needed liquidity. Banks under the Atlanta Fed had a lower failure rate than those under the St. Louis Fed, lending credence to the theory that the panic was largely an issue of liquidity rather than solvency. Illiquidity coupled with a contagion of fear is seen as the major factor in precipitating the financial crisis. A contagion of fear led to higher short-term demand for currency and further strained the liquidity of banks and as a result made them cash flow insolvent. The contagion also led banks to dump their earning assets to build up their reserves which led to the failure of some banks otherwise solvent. Balance sheet insolvency is seen as another possible explanation for the banking panic. However, data shows that most bank failures due to balance sheet insolvency happened between the panics between 1930-1933 while most bank failures due to illiquidity happened during the actual bank panics. Illiquidty shocks were observed by measuring increased hoarding. After the ensuing Great Contraction, the Fed began to learn to deal with regional banking panics and started to embrace its role as lender of last resort. The importance of conducting expansionary monetary policy became evident as a result of the consequent Great Depression."]}

The mills of Girangaon were once integral to Mumbai's economy, particularly during the British colonial period, when Mumbai (then known as Bombay) was often referred to as the \"Manchester of the East\". However, with the development of newer industries in and around Mumbai, these mills ceased to be profitable, and fell into a state of disrepair. In the first half of the nineteenth century, India exported cotton to Britain, and then reimported the textile. In 1820, the total textile import was valued at Rs. 350,000. However, the cost had escalated significantly by 1860, when textile imports stood at Rs. 19.3 million. The impetus towards the founding of a cotton industry came from Indian entrepreneurs. The first Indian cotton mill, \"The Bombay Spinning Mill\", was opened in 1854 in Bombay by Cowasji Nanabhai Davar. Opposition from the Lancashire mill owners was eventually offset by the support of the British manufacturers of textile machinery. The cotton mills of Bombay, and the rest of India, were owned and managed mainly by Indians. The initial investments came from families of the mill-owners, mainly obtained from trading. Later, when shares became available to the public, much of the ownership still remained Indian – of the 53 mills in the city in 1925, only 14 were British-owned. The management and directorships of these mills were also mainly Indian; of the 386 directorships recorded in 1925, only 44 were English. By 1870, there were 13 mills in Bombay. Cotton exports grew during the American Civil War, when supplies from the United States's cotton plantations were interrupted. At the end of 1895, there were 70 mills; growing to 83 in 1915. A period of stagnation set in during the recession of the 1920s. In 1925, there were 81 mills in the city. After World War II, under strong competition from Japan, the mills declined. In 1953, there remained only 53 active mills in the city. Gradually, the government relaxed its norms that once restricted the redevelopment of mill lands, and as a result, numerous high-profile builders quickly took possession of these land parcels. Between 1990 and 2010, the majority of these mill lands were acquired and redeveloped. The table below lists the names and district locations of Mumbai's former mills, and the structures (if any) that stand on their land today. This list is not exhaustive."]}

Garfield political career instead of Garfield Township namesake", "pos": ["James Rudolph Garfield\nJames Rudolph Garfield James Rudolph Garfield (October 17, 1865 – March 24, 1950) was an American politician and lawyer. Garfield was a son of President James A. Garfield and First Lady Lucretia Garfield. He served as Secretary of the Interior during Theodore Roosevelt's administration. Garfield was born in Hiram, Ohio, the third of seven children born to James Abram and Lucretia Rudolph Garfield. For a year prior to his father's presidency, he studied at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. On July 2, 1881, at the age of 15, he and his 17 year old brother Harry Augustus Garfield witnessed the shooting of their father by disgruntled office-seeker Charles J. Guiteau at the Baltimore and Potomac railroad station in Washington. The President and his sons were waiting for a train en route to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where young James had been recently accepted, when the shooting took place. Following his father's death on September 19, 1881, he studied at Williams College. He received his A.B. degree in 1885, and then attended Columbia Law School. In 1888, he was admitted to the Ohio bar and established the Cleveland, Ohio-based law firm of Garfield and Garfield, with his brother Harry Augustus Garfield. From 1890 until her death in 1930, he was married to Helen Newell. Their grandson, Newell Garfield, later married Jane Harrison Walker, a granddaughter of President Benjamin Harrison and Harrison's second wife Mary Dimmick Harrison as well as the great-grandniece of James G. Blaine. From 1896 to 1899, he served in the Ohio State Senate. He was an influential advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt, serving as a Member of the United States Civil Service Commission from 1902 to 1903. From 1903 to 1907, he served as Commissioner of Corporations at the Department of Commerce and Labor, where he conducted investigations of the meat-packing, petroleum, steel, and railroad industries. From 1907 to 1909, he served in Roosevelt's Cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, where he advocated for the conservation of natural resources. He left this post on March 4, 1909, and returned to his law practice in Cleveland. In 1909, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Pittsburgh. Garfield was a contender for the Ohio Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1910 but withdrew from the convention when it endorsed the Taft Administration; the convention went on to nominate future president Warren G. Harding in the third round of balloting. During the 1912 presidential election, he was a key supporter of Roosevelt's bid for a third term. In 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Ohio on the Progressive Party ticket. Roosevelt selected Garfield as one of eighteen officers (others included: Seth Bullock, Frederick Russell Burnham, and John M. Parker) to raise a volunteer infantry division, Roosevelt's World War I volunteers, for service in France in 1917. The U.S. Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the \"Rough Riders\" of 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers; however, as Commander-in-chief, President Woodrow Wilson refused to make use of the volunteers and the unit disbanded. Garfield died in Cleveland, Ohio on March 24, 1950, the last surviving member of Theodore Roosevelt's administration. He had survived his father by 68 1/2 years. He was interred in Mentor Municipal Cemetery in Mentor, Ohio beside his wife Helen.", "Garfield, New Jersey\nGarfield, New Jersey Garfield is a city in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 30,487, reflecting an increase of 701 (+2.4%) from the 29,786 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 3,059 (+11.4%) from the 26,727 counted in the 1990 Census. When the area that is now Garfield was first developed in 1873, it was known as East Passaic. In 1881, the community's name was changed to Garfield in honor of President of the United States James Garfield. There are two explanations given for the circumstances behind the renaming. According to one, shortly after Garfield was elected to the presidency the founder of East Passaic said, \"tell everyone...don't speak of East Passaic anymore; call it 'Garfield' after the man who will lead this great country to prosperity.\" Seven months later, President Garfield was assassinated but his name remained with the community. The second theory holds that after Garfield's death in 1881, a new train station was named in his honor, which in turn led to the surrounding area becoming associated with his name as well. Garfield was originally incorporated as a borough on March 15, 1898, from portions of Saddle River Township and Wallington. At the time, the New Jersey Legislature set Garfield's boundaries as they exist today. On April 19, 1917, the borough became the City of Garfield, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 2.160 square miles (5.594 km), including 2.099 square miles (5.436 km) of land and 0.061 square miles (0.158 km) of water (2.82%). Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Belmont, Bogart Heights, Dundee Dam and Plauderville. The city has land borders with adjacent Elmwood Park, Lodi, Saddle Brook and South Hackensack. The Saddle River is a shared border with Wallington. There are three bridges over the Passaic River crossing the municipal and county line to Passaic and Clifton in Passaic County. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has identified Garfield as the site of groundwater contaminated hexavalent chromium from a spill in 1983 at the E.C. Electroplating Corporation site. In 2016, the EPA announced a $37 million project to cleanup contamination at the site using Superfund money, as the company responsible for the spill of of chromic acid is no longer in business. The borough is also home to an architecturally prominent Russian Orthodox church, which serves the growing Ukrainian American community in western Bergen County.

Garfield Monument stands on the grounds of the United States Capitol in the circle at First Street, S.W., and Maryland Avenue, Washington, D.C. It is a memorial to President James A. Garfield, elected in 1880 and assassinated in 1881 after serving only four months of his term, by a disgruntled office-seeker named Charles J. Guiteau. The monument, sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward (1830-1910) and cast by The Henry-Bonnard Co. of New York, with a pedestal designed by Richard Morris Hunt, is an outstanding example of American Beaux-Arts monument. It was unveiled on May 12, 1887.  Today it stands as part of a three-part sculptural group near the Capitol Reflecting Pool including the Peace Monument and the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial. The memorial was commissioned in 1884 by the Society of the Army of the Cumberland, of which Garfield had been a member. The Society raised almost $28,000 to pay the sculptor. Some of the funds were raised by The Garfield Monument Fair, which was held in the Capitol's Rotunda and National Statuary Hall in 1882. Also in that year, Congress appropriated to the Society $7500 in funds from the sale of condemned cannons; in 1884 it appropriated $30,000 for the pedestal. The monument was incorporated into the Capitol Grounds on January 2, 1975. The inscription reads:<br> (On Garfield statue:) <br> J.Q.A.

Garfielde was born in Shoreham, Vermont, on December 8, 1822. At some point in his life, Garfielde moved to Gallipolis, Ohio, and then to Paris, Kentucky. Sources say his relocation occurred \"in early life\", although whether this means in early childhood or in his late teens is unclear. He was educated in the public schools (where is unclear), and then graduated with a bachelor's degree from Augusta College. To earn money, he taught in public schools both before and after college. Garfielde became a reporter in Kentucky, and in 1849 was elected to the Kentucky Constitutional Convention as a delegate from Fleming County. He traveled throughout South America in 1850 before finally settling in California in 1851. Upon his arrival, he was seriously ill and almost penniless. But he quickly recovered both his financial and physical health. In 1852, Garfielde was elected to the California State Assembly as a Democrat from El Dorado County. He served a single term, from January 3 to May 19, 1853. Garfielde was appointed by the legislature to codify the laws of the state in 1853. During his tenure as a legislator, Garfielde became friends with Frederick H. Billings, a fellow attorney. While serving in the legislature, Garfielde studied law. He was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1854, and established a legal practice in San Francisco. Garfielde married Sarah Electa Perry, also a native of Shoreham, Vermont, in October 1853. The couple had several children, including William Chase Garfield (no \"e\"), born in Kentucky in 1854, and Henry Stevens Garfield (no \"e\"), born in January 1860. The couple's second child, Mollie, died in November 1859 after just a few weeks of life. The couple's sixth child, Charles Darwin Garfield (no \"e\"), was born in February 1867 and became a widely known fur trader in Alaska. He died in Seattle, Washington, in September 1961. It is probable that Garfielde returned to Kentucky in 1854. Active in Democratic politics, he was elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1856, where he became a supporter of Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Stephens lost the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Garfielde proved a loyal Democratic, however. During the election, Garfielde traveled heavily through what were then the western and northwestern states, delivering thousands of public speeches in support of Buchanan. He earned a wide reputation as a \"captivating\" public speaker. His service on the campaign trail left Kentucky Democrats feeling deeply in his debt. Buchanan proved grateful to Garfielde for his campaign efforts, and appointed him Receiver of Public Monies for the Land Office in the Washington Territory. Garfielde emigrated to Olympia, Washington Territory, that spring. Almost immediately, he became a supporter of Isaac Stevens, then campaigning for election as Washington Territory's first Territorial Delegate to Congress. When Stevens ran for re-election in 1858, Garfielde abandoned him early in the campaign. He feared that Stevens would lose the general election, jeopardizing Garfielde's position at the land office. By 1859, Garfield's political views had shifted. A staunch Unionist, Garfielde (still a Democrat) now allied himself with the newly formed Republican Party. William Winlock Miller, a former prominent federal official in the Oregon Territory who had become an important businessman in the region, advised Stevens to deprive Garfielde of his land office position. Stevens attempted to do so in January 1860. But Democrats in Kentucky rallied to Garfielde's defense, forcing Stevens to hold off. By late May, however, Garfielde's support had withered in light of his pro-Republican activities, and Stevens was able to block Garfielde's reappointment. Garfielde's term as receiver of public moneys ended on August 16, 1860. Garfielde sought the Democratic Party nomination for Territorial Delegate in 1861. Stevens saw unification of the Democratic Party as the only solution to the national crisis over slavery, which was threatening to tear the United States apart. Garfielde, however, broke with pro-secession Democrats, putting him at odds with Stevens. At the Democratic Party's territorial convention, pro-Union forces obtained a ruling from the chair that proxy votes could not be counted. This heavily damaged Stevens' chances for renomination as Territorial Delegate. After two rounds of balloting, some of Stevens' supporters became disgusted with their treatment by the chair and walked out. His candidacy crippled, Isaac Stevens withdrew his name from contention. The convention then split, with pro-Union forces nominating Garfielde and pro-secession forces nominating territorial judge Edward Lander. Republicans, meanwhile, nominated attorney William H. Wallace. Garfielde and Lander spent the campaign attacking one another, and on election day Wallace won election to Congress with 43 percent of the vote. Garfield had 37.6 percent, and Lander 19.4 percent. Garfielde next played a direct role in the organization of the Idaho Territory. The Washington Territory had originally been part of the vast Oregon Territory. But massive population growth north of the Columbia River led to a divergence of interests between the northern southern parts of the territory. In 1853, the Washington Territory was split from the Oregon Territory. In 1859, Oregon was admitted as a U.S. state. That portion of the Oregon Territory not admitted as a state became part of the Washington Territory. That same year, gold was discovered in Idaho. By 1861, the cities of Pierce and Oro Fino in the Idaho panhandle each had twice the population of either Olympia or Vancouver on the Pacific coast. Major silver lodes were discovered that year at Silver City and Idaho City, leading to even greater population growth. Calls for local control of economic and political affairs grew stronger. In December 1861, the Washington Territory organized Idaho County and Nez Perce County out of the larger Shoshone County. Sentiment was growing that the economic interests of the mining area of Idaho increasingly lacked commonality with the shipping and timber interests of Washington. In the summer of 1862, Selucius Garfielde helped to create the Idaho Territory. During the Washington Territorial Delegate election in 1861, each candidate for office had pledged that if he were elected he would work for the creation of a new territory. In the summer of 1862, William H. Wallace called a conference of leading men at Oro Fino. Among them were Garfielde; Dr. Anson G. Henry, a physician and land surveyor; and George \"Growler\" Walker, an influential carpenter from Silver City. At what became known as the Oro Fino Conference, the group decided to seek organization of the Idaho Territory out of the eastern part of the Washington Territory and the western half of the Dakota Territory (which had been organized in 1861). The group's chances were good, as Dr. Henry had treated Abraham Lincoln for depression in 1841 and had remained Lincoln's good friend ever since. With Lincoln now president, Henry made the pitch for a new Idaho Territory. Lincoln agreed, and the new territory was duly organized by Congress on March 4, 1863. During most of the period from 1862 to 1864, Garfielde lived in British Columbia, Canada. Garfielde switched political parties, becoming a Republican some time between November 1861 and January 1864. Garfielde continued to practice law, but he also continued to be actively involved in politics. In the Territorial Delegate election of 1864, he stumped throughout the territory for Republican candidate Arthur A. Denny. By 1865, Garfielde could be counted among the top Republican contenders for any office he chose. In 1866, the Republicans denied Denny the nomination, choosing instead Alvan Flanders. Garfielde's popularity was such that, at the beginning of the convention, even he received a few votes to be the party nominee. President Andrew Johnson appointed him surveyor general of Washington Territory in 1866, and he served in that positioni until early 1869. Garfielde continued to have outside interests as well. About 1868, Garfielde joined with Daniel Bagley, P.H. Lewis, Josiah Settle, and George F. Whitworth to buy up several abandoned coal mining claims east of Seattle. They formed the Lake Washington Company, and won passage of legislation in the state legislature creating the Coal Creek Road Company. The road firm's goal was to build a road east to the coal fields. In 1870, the owners sold out to new investors, reaping a profit of 500 percent. In 1868, Garfielde sought and won the Republican Party's nomination for Territorial Delegate. His nomination was not without problems. Garfielde's inconstant political views and his flowery oratory had alienated many, who felt he was a political opportunist. They nicknamed him \"Selucius the Babbler\". Opposition to Garfielde's nomination was so strong that Alvan Flanders, the incumbent Territorial Delegate who had been denied renomination, and Christopher C. Hewitt, Chief Justice of the Washington Territorial Supreme Court, distributed a circular declaring the state Republican Party near collapse. They and the other signatories to the circular (which numbered more than 50 prominent Republicans) declared the party nomination process fraudulent and demanded radical reorganization of the party machinery. These and other accusations led to a significant backlash against the disaffected Republicans, who quickly retreated from their positions and declined to nominate their own candidate. The damage done, however, was significant. Garfielde won election over Marshall F. Moore by just 149 votes out of more than 5,300 cast. Due to a change in the date of the election, Garfielde's term of office lasted nearly three years. He began serving on March 4, 1869, but the House declined to seat him until December 1870. Garfielde won re-election to Congress in 1870 over Walla Walla Democrat J.D. Mix by a more comfortable 735 votes out of more than 6,200 cast. Garfielde lost re-election to Congress in 1872. Garfielde's desire to make money on outside business interests did not abate during his tenure in Congress. In 1871, Jay Cooke, the investment banker who controlled the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), hired Garfielde to stump throughout the Washington Territory to promote the railway's interests among voters. Cooke hired Garfielde, in part, because he believed this would please Frederick Billings, then the head of the NP's land office. But Billings heartily disliked Garfield, accusing him of being \"too much of a politician\" and arguing that it was unseemly for a sitting member of Congress to engage in such blatant promotion of a specific business interest. Billings also believed that Garfielde had allied himself too closely to independent loggers who routinely stolen timber from NP forest lands. Garfielde believed his work for the railway and the loggers would win him the votes he needed for re-election. But Garfielde did not count on the massive influx of new voters into the Washington Territory, most of whom were Democrats. Garfielde was defeated in 1872 in his bid for a third term by Democrat Obadiah Benton McFadden by 761 votes out of 7,700 cast. He left office on March 3, 1873. Garfielde remained influential in Republican politics, however. President Ulysses S. Grant, elected to a second term as President in November 1872, appointed him customs collector for the Puget Sound District on March 26, 1873. Garfielde left Washington, D.C., and moved to Seattle where he engaged in the practice of law and served as customs collector until June 22, 1874. Garfielde returned to Washington, D.C., shortly after losing his customs job. He established several gambling parlors in the city, and although frequently raided he never served jail time. Garfielde had long exhibited a number of habits, many of which—like gambling, heavy drinking, and womanizing—were considered bad if not outright immoral by good citizens of the day. By the late 1870s, Sarah Garfielde had had enough, and the couple divorced about 1879. Garfielde did not live long after his divorce. He married Nellie Homer, proprietress of a bar for the criminal element and down-and-out, in late 1881. Garfielde fell ill with both pleurisy and pneumonia in April 1883. He began deteriorating quickly on April 11, and died at his home at 410 10th Street NW at 5:30 p.m. on April 13. He was interred at Glenwood Cemetery. Although he was a Freemason and past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Washington Territory, Masonic rites were not observed at his funeral as he had not affiliated with any lodge in the D.C. area."]}
{"query": "La Monte Young personal life and non-musical collaborations instead of musical compositions and minimalism", "pos": ["La Monte Young\nLa Monte Young La Monte Thornton Young (born October 14, 1935) is an American avant-garde composer, musician, and artist generally recognized as the first minimalist composer. His works are cited as prominent examples of post-war experimental and contemporary music, and were tied to New York's downtown music and Fluxus art scenes. Young is perhaps best known for his pioneering work in Western drone music (originally referred to as \"dream music\"), prominently explored in the 1960s with the experimental music collective the Theatre of Eternal Music. He has engaged in musical and multimedia collaborations with a wide range of artists, including Tony Conrad, Pandit Pran Nath, John Cale, Terry Riley, and multimedia artist Marian Zazeela, with whom he developed the \"Dream House\" sound and light environment. Young's work has called into question the nature and definition of music. Despite having released very little recorded material throughout his career—much of it currently out of print—\"Vulture\" described him as the most influential living composer today. \"The Observer\" wrote that his work has had \"an utterly profound effect on the last half-century of music.\" His evolving composition \"The Well-Tuned Piano\", first conceived in 1964, has been characterized as \"one of the great achievements of 20th-century music\" by \"The Guardian\". Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho, where as a child he was formatively influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers. During his childhood, Young's family moved several times before settling in Los Angeles, as his father searched for work. He was raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He graduated from John Marshall High School and studied at Los Angeles City College. In the jazz milieu of Los Angeles, Young played with notable musicians including Ornette Coleman, Don Cherry, and Billy Higgins. He undertook further studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he received a BA in 1958, then at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1960. In 1959 he attended the summer courses at the Darmstadt School under Karlheinz Stockhausen, and in 1960 relocated to New York in order to study electronic music with Richard Maxfield at the New School for Social Research. His compositions during this period were influenced by Anton Webern, Gregorian chant, Indian classical music, Gagaku, and Indonesian gamelan music. A number of Young's early works use the twelve-tone technique, which he studied under Leonard Stein at Los Angeles City College. (Stein had served as an assistant to Arnold Schoenberg when Schoenberg, the inventor of the twelve-tone method, taught at UCLA.) Young also studied composition with Robert Stevenson at UCLA and with Seymore Shifrin at UC Berkeley. In 1958, he developed the Trio for Strings, originally scored for violin, viola, and cello, which would presage his work in proceeding years. The Trio for Strings has been described as an \"origin point for minimalism.\" When Young visited Darmstadt in 1959, he encountered the music and writings of John Cage. There he also met Cage's collaborator, pianist David Tudor, who subsequently gave premières of some of Young's works. At Tudor's suggestion, Young engaged in a correspondence with Cage. Within a few months Young was presenting some of Cage's music on the West Coast. In turn, Cage and Tudor included some of Young's works in performances throughout the U.S. and Europe. By this time Young had taken a turn toward the conceptual, using principles of indeterminacy in his compositions and incorporating non-traditional sounds, noises, and actions. When Young moved to New York in 1960, he had already established a reputation as an \"enfant terrible\" of the avant-garde. He initially developed an artistic relationship with Fluxus founder George Maciunas (who designed the book Young edited An Anthology of Chance Operations) and other members of the nascent movement. Yoko Ono, for example, hosted a series of concerts curated by Young at her loft, and absorbed, it seems, his often parodic and politically charged aesthetic. Young's works of the time, scored as short haiku-like texts, though conceptual and extreme, were not meant to be merely provocative but, rather, dream-like. His \"Compositions 1960\" includes a number of unusual actions. Some of them are un-performable, but each deliberately examines a certain presupposition about the nature of music and art and carries ideas to an extreme. One instructs: \"draw a straight line and follow it\" (a directive which he has said has guided his life and work since). Another instructs the performer to build a fire. Another states that \"this piece is a little whirlpool out in the middle of the ocean.\" Another says the performer should release a butterfly into the room. Yet another challenges the performer to push a piano through a wall. \"Composition 1960 #7\" proved especially pertinent to his future endeavors: it consisted of a B, an F#, a perfect fifth, and the instruction: \"To be held for a long time.\" In 1962 Young wrote \"The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer\". One of \"The Four Dreams of China\", the piece is based on four pitches, which he later gave as the frequency ratios: 36-35-32-24 (G, C, +C#, D), and limits as to which may be combined with any other. Most of his pieces after this point are based on select pitches, played continuously, and a group of long held pitches to be improvised upon. For \"The Four Dreams of China\" Young began to plan \"Dream House\", a light and sound installation conceived as a \"work that would be played continuously and ultimately exist as a 'living organism with a life and tradition of its own,'\" where musicians would live and create music twenty-four hours a day. He formed the music collective Theatre of Eternal Music to realize \"Dream House\" and other pieces. The group initially included calligrapher and light artist Marian Zazeela (who married Young in 1963), Angus MacLise, and Billy Name. In 1964 the ensemble comprised Young and Zazeela, John Cale and Tony Conrad (a former Harvard mathematics major), and sometimes Terry Riley (voices). Since 1966 the group has seen many permutations and has included Garrett List, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea, and many others, including members of the 60s groups. Young and Zazeela's first continuous electronic sound environment was created in their loft on Church Street, New York in September 1966 with sine wave generators and light sources designed to produce a continuous installation of floating sculptures and color sources, and a series of slides entitled \"Ornamental Lightyears Tracery\". This \"Dream House\" environment was maintained almost continuously from September 1966 to January 1970, being turned off only to listen to \"other music\" and to study the contrast between extended periods in it and periods of silence. Young and Zazeela worked, sang and lived in it and studied the effects on themselves and visitors. Performances were often extreme in length, conceived by Young as having no beginning and no end, existing before and after any particular performance. In their daily lives, too, Young and Zazeela practiced an extended sleep-waking schedule—with \"days\" longer than twenty-four hours. Beginning in 1970 interests in Asian classical music and a wish to be able to find the intervals he had been using in his work led Young to pursue studies with Pandit Pran Nath. Fellow students included Zazeela, composers Terry Riley, Michael Harrison, and Yoshi Wada, philosophers Henry Flynt and Catherine Christer Hennix and many others. Young considers \"The Well-Tuned Piano\"—a permuting composition of themes and improvisations for just-intuned solo piano—to be his masterpiece. Young gave the world premiere of \"The Well-Tuned Piano\" in Rome in 1974, ten years after the creation of the piece. Previously, Young had presented it as a recorded work. In 1975, Young premiered it in New York with eleven live performances during the months of April and May. As of October 25, 1981, the date of the Gramavision recording of \"The Well-Tuned Piano\", Young had performed the piece 55 times. In 1987, Young performed the piece again as part of a larger concert series that included many more of his works. This performance, on May 10, 1987, was videotaped and released on DVD in 2000 on Young's label, \"Just Dreams\". Performances have exceeded six hours in length, and so far have only been documented several times. It is strongly influenced by mathematical composition as well as Hindustani classical music practice. Since the 1970s, Young and Zazeela have realized a long series of semi-permanent \"Dream House\" installations, which combine Young's just-intuned sine waves in elaborate, symmetrical configurations and Zazeela's quasi-calligraphic light sculptures. In July 1970 a model short-term \"Dream House\" was displayed to the public at Galerie Heiner Friedrich in Munich, Germany. Later, model \"Dream House\" environments were presented in various locations of Europe and the United States. In 1974, the two released \"Dream House 78' 17\"\". From January through April 19, 2009, \"Dream House\" was installed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York as part of \"The Third Mind\" exhibition. A \"Dream House\" installation exists today at the Mela Foundation on 275 Church Street, New York above the couple's loft, and is open to the public. In 2002, Young, along with Marian Zazeela, and senior disciple Jung Hee Choi founded the Just Alap Raga Ensemble. This ensemble, performing Indian classical music of the Kirana Gharana, merges the traditions of Western and Hindustani classical music, with Young applying his own compositional approach to traditional raga performance, form, and technique. Young's first musical influence came in early childhood in Bern. He relates that \"the very first sound that I recall hearing was the sound of wind blowing under the eaves and around the log extensions at the corners of the log cabin\". Continuous sounds—human-made as well as natural—fascinated him as a child. He described himself as fascinated from a young age by droning sounds, such as \"the sound of the wind blowing\", the \"60 cycle per second drone [of] step-down transformers on telephone poles\", the \"tanpura\" drone and the \"alap\" of Indian classical music, \"certain static aspects of serialism, as in the Webern slow movement of the Symphony Opus 21\", and Japanese \"gagaku\" \"which has sustained tones in it in the instruments such as the Sho\". The four pitches he later named the \"Dream chord\", on which he based many of his mature works, came from his early age appreciation of the continuous sound made by the telephone poles in Bern. Jazz is one of his main influences and until 1956 he planned to devote his career to it. At first, Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh influenced his alto saxophone playing style, and later John Coltrane shaped Young's use of the sopranino saxophone. Jazz was, together with Indian music, an important influence on the use of improvisation in his works after 1962. La Monte Young discovered Indian music in 1957 on the campus of UCLA. He cites Ali Akbar Khan (sarod) and Chatur Lal (tabla) as particularly significant. The discovery of the tambura, which he learned to play with Pandit Pran Nath, was a decisive influence in his interest in long sustained sounds. Young also acknowledges the influence of Japanese music, especially Gagaku, and Pygmy music. La Monte Young discovered classical music rather late, thanks to his teachers at university. He cites Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky, Pérotin, Léonin, Claude Debussy and Organum musical style as important influences, but what made the biggest impact on his compositions was the serialism of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern. Young was also keen to pursue his musical endeavors with the help of psychedelics. Cannabis, LSD and peyote played an important part in Young's life from mid-1950s onwards, when he was introduced to them by Terry Jennings and Billy Higgins. He said that \"everybody [he] knew and worked with was very much into drugs as a creative tool as well as a consciousness-expanding tool\". This was the case with the musicians of the Theatre of Eternal Music, with whom he \"got high for every concert: the whole group\". He considers that the cannabis experience helped him open up to where he went with \"Trio for Strings\", though sometimes it proved a disadvantage when performing anything which required keeping track of the number of elapsed bars. He commented on the subject: Young has been described as the most influential living composer today. His use of long tones and exceptionally high volume has been extremely influential with Young's associates: Tony Conrad, Jon Hassell, Rhys Chatham, Michael Harrison, Henry Flynt, Ben Neill, Charles Curtis, and Catherine Christer Hennix. It has also been notably influential on John Cale's contribution to The Velvet Underground's sound; Cale has been quoted as saying \"LaMonte <nowiki>[Young]</nowiki> was perhaps the best part of my education and my introduction to musical discipline.\" Brian Eno was similarly influenced by Young's work, calling him \"the daddy of us all.\" In 1981, Eno referred to \"X for Henry Flynt\" by saying \"It really is a cornerstone of everything I've done since\". Andy Warhol attended the 1962 première of the static composition by La Monte Young called \"Trio for Strings\" and subsequently created his famous series of static films including \"Kiss\", \"Eat\", and \"Sleep\" (for which Young was initially commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites film-maker Jonas Mekas, who accompanied Warhol to the \"Trio\" premiere and claims that Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance. In 1963 Warhol, Young, and Walter De Maria briefly formulated a musical group, which included lyrics written by Jasper Johns. Lou Reed's 1975 album \"Metal Machine Music\" states \"Drone cognizance and harmonic possibilities vis a vis Lamont Young's Dream Music (sic)\" among its \"Specifications\". The album \"\" by the band Spacemen 3 is influenced by La Monte Young's concept of \"Dream Music\", evidenced by their inclusion of his notes on the jacket. In 2018, Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3, along with Etienne Jaumet of Zombie Zombie and Indian dhrupad singer Céline Wadier, released \"Infinite Music: A Tribute to La Monte Young\". Bowery Electric dedicated the song \"Postscript\" on the 1996 album \"Beat\" to Young and Riley. Drone rock pioneer Dylan Carlson has stated Young's work as being a major influence to him. Young's students include senior disciple Jung Hee Choi, as well as Michael Harrison, Arnold Dreyblatt and Daniel James Wolf."], "neg": ["Waging Heavy Peace\nWaging Heavy Peace Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream is the first autobiography by the rock musician Neil Young, published in 2012. Featuring a non-linear narrative, the book covers aspects of his career, family life, hobbies, and non-musical pursuits. It was generally well-received among critics. The book is Young's first autobiography and was written in 2011. According to Jimmy McDonough in the 2002 biography \"Shakey\", Young had previously stated he would not write about himself. He explains his reasons for writing the book in a chapter called \"Why This Book Exists\". The 66-year-old musician states that the book is meant to make money to allow him a recuperation period away from touring and music-making. Young, who suffered a brain aneurysm in 2005, mentions the possibility of dementia in his father's health history as providing an additional impetus for writing his memoirs. The musician stopped drinking and smoking marijuana during the writing period. Young declined a ghostwriter from his publisher – writing is a family trade: father Scott Young was a sports columnist and prolific writer. One focus of the work is Young's family. He discusses his two wives, including then-current wife Pegi and first wife Susan Acevedo as well as his relationship with Carrie Snodgress. He also talks about his children, including sons Ben and Zeke, who suffer from cerebral palsy. Young's home, the northern California ranch called Broken Arrow, features in the book. Young's hobbies are discussed at length. He relates his love of model train building and his involvement with Lionel, LLC, a model train company, where he is a board member. He talks about his interest in carpentry, and his forays into filmmaking. Vehicles are another love, including his 1953 Buick Skylark and the electric-converted Lincoln Continental, known as LincVolt (Young is a proponent of electric vehicles and designed the LincVolt himself). Yet another obsession is his PureSound audio system (now known as Pono), which aims to replace iPod as the dominant digital music format. In terms of his career, the book covers his early years as a performer in Canada, including his time with the Squires in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Young's California days, his work in the 1980s with his charity the Bridge School Benefit, and the health problems of the 2000s also feature in the book. The book was generally received well, although with the caveat that it is more enjoyable for fans than for those unfamiliar with the artist. \"The Guardian\" said the style was \"distinctly unplugged\", and the direction \"unpredictable\". The \"New York Times\" made comparisons to novelist Stephen King in terms of writing style, commented that the author \"seems completely free of guile\", and approved of the affirmative, positive tone of Young's recollections. Several reviewers made comparisons to Bob Dylan's autobiographical \"\". The New Orleans \"Times-Picayune\" called it \"a satisfying read for the true fan.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" described it as \"sprawling, improvisational\", \"a stream-of-consciousness-meditation\", and calls it less a memoir than a self-portrait. Canada's \"National Post\" called it a \"disarming, beguiling autobiography\"."]}
{"query": "Entomology applications in modern agriculture instead of historical figures in coleopterology.", "pos": ["Economic entomology\nEconomic entomology Economic entomology is a field of entomology, which involves the study of insects that benefit or harm humans, domestic animals, and crops. Insects that cause losses are termed as pests. Some species can cause indirect damage by spreading diseases and these are termed as vectors. Those that are beneficial include those reared for food such as honey, substances such as lac or pigments and for their role in pollinating crops and controlling pests. In the 18th century many works were published on agriculture. Many contained accounts of pest insects. In France Claude Sionnest (1749–1820) was a notable figure. In Britain, John Curtis wrote the influential 1860 treatise \"Farm Insects\", dealing with the insect pests of corn, roots, grass and stored grain. Fruit and pests were described by authors such as Saunders, Joseph Albert Lintner, Eleanor Anne Ormerod, Charles Valentine Riley, Mark Vernon Slingerland in America and Canada. The pioneers in Europe were Ernst Ludwig Taschenberg, Sven Lampa (1839–1914), Enzio Reuter (1867–1951) and Vincenze Kollar. Charles French (1842–1933), Walter Wilson Froggatt (1858–1937) and Henry Tryon (1856–1943) pioneered in Australia. It was not until the last quarter of the 19th century that any real advance was made in the study of economic entomology. Among the early writings, besides the book of Curtis, there was a publication by Pohl and Kollar, entitled \"Insects Injurious to Gardeners, Foresters and Farmers\", published in 1837, and Taschenberg's \"Praktische Insecktenkunde\". During the 19th century Italian entomologists made significant progress in controlling diseases of the silkworm moth, in the control of agricultural pests and in stored product entomology. Significant figures were: Agostino Bassi ( 1773–1856), Camillo Róndani (1808–1879), Adolfo Targioni Tozzetti (1823–1902), Pietro Stefanelli (1835, 1919), Camillo Acqua (1863–1936) Antonio Berlese (1863–1927), Gustavo Leonardi(1869–1918) and Enrico Verson (1845–1927). In France Etienne Laurent Joseph Hippolyte Boyer de Fonscolombe, Charles Jean-Baptiste Amyot, Émile Blanchard, Valéry Mayet and Claude Charles Goureau were early workers, as was Jean Victoire Audouin, the author of \"Histoire des insectes nuisibles à la vigne et particulièrement de la Pyrale\", Philippe Alexandre Jules Künckel d'Herculais, Joseph Jean Baptiste Géhin and Jean-Étienne Girard. American literature began as far back as 1788, when a report on the Hessian fly was issued by Sir Joseph Banks; in 1817 Thomas Say began his writings; while in 1856 Asa Fitch started his report on \"Noxious Insects of New York\". Also in America, Matthew Cooke wrote \"Treatise on the Insects Injurious to Fruit and Fruit Trees of the State of California, and Remedies Recommended for Their Extermination\", published in 1881. The Englishman Frederick Vincent Theobald wrote A textbook of agricultural zoology in 1890. It became a standard text worldwide. Notable foresters were Herman von Nördlinger (1818–1897) and Julius Theodor Christian Ratzeburg (1801–1871). Among the most important reports early in the 20th century were those of Charles Valentine Riley, published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, extending from 1878 to his death, in which is embodied an enormous amount of valuable material. At his death the work fell to Professor Leland Ossian Howard, in the form of \"Bulletin of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\". The chief writings of J. A. Lintner extend from 1882 to 1898, in yearly parts, under the title of \"Reports on the Injurious Insects of the State of New York\". Another significant contributor to the entomological literature of the United States was Charles W. Woodworth. The Florida entomologist Wilmon Newell was a pioneer of pest control as was Clarence Preston Gillette. In India Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher, who succeeded Harold Maxwell-Lefroy and Lionel de Nicéville as the first Imperial Entomologist, wrote \"Some South Indian insects and other animals of importance considered especially from an economic point of view\", an influential work in the subcontinent. In France Alfred Balachowsky was a key figure. In the last quarter of the 20th century new techniques were pioneered and new theories developed, for instance Integrated Pest Management by Ray F. Smith. Insects considered \"pests\" of some sort occur among all major living orders with the exception of Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Odonata, Plecoptera (stoneflies), Embioptera (webspinners), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Neuroptera (in the broad sense), and Mecoptera (also, the tiny groups Zoraptera, Grylloblattodea, and Mantophasmatodea). Conversely, of course, essentially all insect orders primarily have members which are beneficial, in some respects, with the exception of Phthiraptera (lice), Siphonaptera (fleas), and Strepsiptera, the three orders whose members are exclusively parasitic. Insects are considered as pests for a variety of reasons, including their  Examples:  In the past entomologists working on pest insects attempted to \"eradicate\" species. This has rarely worked except in islands or controlled environments and raises ethical issues. Over time the language has changed to terms like \"control\" and \"management\". The indiscriminate use of toxic and persistent chemicals and the resurgence of pests in the history of cotton growing in the US has been particularly well studied. Honey is perhaps the most economically valuable product from insects. Beekeeping is a commercial enterprise in most parts of the world and many forest tribes have been dependent on honey as a major source of nutrition. Honeybees can also act as pollinators of crop species. Many predators and parasitoid insects are encouraged and augmented in modern agriculture. Silk is extracted from both reared caterpillars as well as from the wild (producing wild silk). Sericulture deals with the techniques for efficient silkworm rearing and silk production. Although new fabric materials have substituted silk in many applications, it continues to be the material of choice for surgical sutures. Lac was once extracted from scale insects but is now replaced by synthetic substitutes. The dye extracted from cochineal insects was similarly replaced by technological advances. The idea of insects as human food, entomophagy, widely practised in traditional societies, has been proposed as a solution to meet the growing demand for food, but has not gained widespread acceptance in the West.", "Entomology\nEntomology Entomology () is the scientific study of insects, a branch of zoology. In the past the term \"insect\" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use. Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics, behavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental biology, ecology, morphology, and paleontology. At some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms, date back some 400 million years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth. Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping), but scientific study began only as recently as the 16th century. William Kirby is widely considered as the father of Entomology. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, \"Introduction to Entomology\", regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as Charles Darwin, Jean-Henri Fabre, Vladimir Nabokov, Karl von Frisch (winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner E. O. Wilson. There has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance, such as Sophie Lutterlough at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with butterflies and dragonflies being the most popular. Most insects can easily be recognized to order such as Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) or Coleoptera (beetles). However, insects other than Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are typically identifiable to genus or species only through the use of Identification keys and Monographs. Because the class Insecta contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 species of beetles alone) and the characteristics separating them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a microscope), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of automated species identification systems targeted on insects, for example, Daisy, ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing. In 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new professional certification program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a \"true entomologist\" an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing their PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs, Amateur Entomologists, or Associate Entomologists. Many entomologists specialize in a single order or even a family of insects, and a number of these subspecialties are given their own informal names, typically (but not always) derived from the scientific name of the group: Like other scientific specialties, entomologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations. There are also many organizations specializing in specific subareas. Here is a list of selected museums which contain very large insect collections.    Entomology has been depicted in various films such as:"], "neg": ["Agricultural science\nAgricultural science Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.) The three terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:  Agricultural sciences include research and development on: Agricultural biotechnology is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including genetic engineering, molecular markers, molecular diagnostics, vaccines, and tissue culture, to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and microorganisms. One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter. Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment. In the 18th century, Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulphate) as a fertilizer. In 1843, John Lawes and Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term field experiments at Rothamsted Research Station in England; some of them are still running. In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887, which used the term \"agricultural science\". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built. After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years."]}
{"query": "Cahokia style projectile points manufacturing techniques instead of their distribution in Steed-Kisker sites", "pos": ["Projectile point\nProjectile point In archaeological terms, a projectile point is an object that was hafted to weapon that was capable of being thrown or projected, such as a spear, dart, or arrow, or perhaps used as a knife. They are thus different from weapons presumed to have been kept in the hand, such as axes and maces, and the stone mace or axe-heads often attached to them.  Stone tools, including projectile points, can survive for long periods, were often lost or discarded, and are relatively plentiful, especially at archaeological sites, providing useful clues to the human past, including prehistoric trade. A distinctive form of point, identified though lithic analysis of the way it was made, is often a key diagnostic factor in identifying an archaeological industry or culture. Scientific techniques exist to track the specific kinds of rock or minerals that used to make stone tools in various regions back to their original sources.  As well as stone, projectile points were also made of worked bone, antler or ivory; all of these are less common in the Americas. In regions where metallurgy emerged, projectile points were eventually made from copper, bronze, or iron, though the change was by no means immediate. In North America, some late prehistoric points were fashioned from copper that was mined in the Lake Superior region and elsewhere. A large variety of prehistoric arrowheads, dart points, and spear points have been discovered. Flint, obsidian, quartz and many other rocks and minerals were commonly used to make points in North America. The oldest projectile points found in North America were long thought to date from about 13,000 years ago, during the Paleo-Indian period, however recent evidence suggests that North American projectile points may date to as old as 15,500 years. Some of the more famous Paleo-Indian types include Clovis, Folsom and Dalton points. Projectile points fall into two general types: dart/spear points, and arrow points. Larger points were used to tip spears and atlatl darts. Arrow points are smaller and lighter than dart points, and were used to tip arrows. The question of how to distinguish an arrow point from a point used on a larger projectile is non-trivial. According to some investigators, the best indication is the width of the hafting area, which is thought to correlate to the width of the shaft. An alternative approach is to distinguish arrow points by their necessarily smaller size (weight, length, thickness). Projectile points come in an amazing variety of shapes and styles, which vary according to chronological periods, cultural identities, and intended functions. Typological studies of projectile points have become more elaborate through the years. For instance, Gregory Perino began his categorical study of projectile point typology in the late 1950s. Collaborating with Robert Bell, he published a set of four volumes defining the known point types of that time. Perino followed this several years later with a three-volume study of \"Selected Preforms, Points and Knives of the North American Indians\". Another recent set of typological studies of North American projectile points has been produced by Noel Justice."], "neg": ["Lamoka projectile point\nLamoka projectile point Lamoka projectile points are stone projectile points manufactured by Native Americans what is now the northeastern United States, generally in the time interval of 3500-2500 B.C. They predate the invention of the bow and arrow, and are therefore not true \"arrowheads\", but rather atlatl dart points. They derive their name from the specimens found at the Lamoka site in Schuyler County, New York. Lamoka points sizes range in length from less than an inch to 2½ inches with an average of about 1½ inches. They are narrow and thick, with straight or slightly notched stems. The base is thick and this is diagnostic for the Lamoka point. They are two to three times longer than they are wide. They are generally made from local flints, jasper, quartz and quartzite. There are a number of varieties, the most common being the \"stemmed\" type with straight stems. They have mostly been dated to around 3500-2500 BC, but the type persists in small numbers up to about 1000 A.D. The archaic points are associated with the Lamoka culture. These points are generally found in the American northeast (New York and Pennsylvania; a very similar \"Dustin point\" is found as far west as Michigan) and central Canada (Ontario)."]}

In an extensive interview, Tahmineh Milani stated that the name \"Two Women\" alluded to \"two\" different potential life-stories of \"one\" woman. The film won the best screenplay award at Iran's Fajr Film Festival in 1999 as well as Best Actress for Niki Karimi's part in the Taormina Film Festival. The film starts at some fourteen years after Fereshteh (Niki Karimi) and Royā (Merilā Zāre'í) became friends, while studying architecture at a university in Tehran. Fereshteh's husband is in the ICU and she needs Roya's help. The events in the life of Fereshteh over the course of the preceding fourteen years are revealed through a series of flashbacks that represent Feresheh's and Royā's reminiscences.  Fereshteh, whose family lives in reduced circumstances in Esfahan, is an excellent student who brims with hopes and expectations for her future and what she would do for her family on graduating. A voracious reader, she seems to know almost everything and is ready to face any difficulty, she has no interest in marrying just yet but instead wants to build a successful career. Fereshteh supports herself financially through giving private tuitions to fellow students. Royā's family, on the other hand, are wealthy. She becomes one of Fereshteh's private pupils and through this a deep friendship develops between the two.  Fereshteh is stalked by an obsessive young man, named Hassan (Mohammad-Rezā Foroutan), who stops at nothing for gaining her attention and, as he puts it, marrying her. He stirs up many problems, including inflicting serious bodily harm by throwing acid to Fereshteh's cousin on mistaking him as Fereshteh's boyfriend. This prompts Fereshteh's father (Rezā Khāndān) forcing her to return to their home in Esfahan (although Fereshteh lives independently in a university dormitory, she is formally in the care of her uncle, her father's brother, who lives in Tehran); through some inverted logic, the father believes that the actions of the stalker must have been provoked by some impropriety on the part of his daughter.  These events take place at the time when the universities are being closed by the government of Iran (which in reality took place in the second half of 1979 — see Iranian Cultural Revolution of 1980-1987) so that Fereshteh does not see her departure from Tehran as life-changing, but as a temporary event with no consequence for her studies and her future plans. The stalker follows Fereshteh to Esfahan and during a motorcycle-car chase causes a fatal accident involving two children playing football on street. The ultimately causes the stalker to be sentenced to 13 years in prison - as he's dragged away to prison he vows to kill Fereshteh when he's released. A man, named Ahmad (Atila Pesiani), who helps Fereshteh and her family with the legal case and fees ensuing this accident, asks Fereshteh's hand and despite Fereshteh's initial fierce opposition to the proposal, by promising to be supportive of Fereshteh's plan to pursue her studies following the opening of universities, succeeds in gaining Fereshteh's consent and the two marry. After the marriage, he proves to be an utterly jealous husband who bars Fereshteh from having any contact with the outside world that he does not approve of, including association with Royā; although he does not know Royā at all, he feels a visceral hatred towards her, believing that she represents the liberal society that he finds so detestable.  When Fereshteh applies to court for divorce, the presiding judge dismisses the case outright, stating that none of the actions of her husband, that suffocate her both emotionally and intellectually, were sufficient for the court to grant divorce. The judge's decision is based on Fereshteh answering a series of questions, such as whether her husband was violent, whether he was unfaithful, whether he had drugs additions, etc., in the negative; in response to Fereshteh's repeated pleas and appeal to her being a human being, the judge retorts not to waste the time of the court. It is remarkable that although one never sees Ahmad beating Fereshteh, in reality he is a violent man, as he constantly verbally abuses Fereshteh and often brandishes a kitchen knife while doing so; this is Milāni's sutbtle way of showing how domestic violence is often not recognized even by its very victims. Fereshteh and her husband have two sons (both in their teens when Fereshteh and Royā meet after fourteen years) who outwardly love both parents equally, but inwardly stand on the side of their mother, who, amongst others, teaches them to the best of her ability.  Fereshteh tries to leave her husband multiple times but events conspire against her and she's unable to do so, until 13 years have passed and the stalker is once again at her doorstep. Finally after yet fight with her controlling husband (he finds out she's been secretly acquiring and reading books, including those about childcare) she runs out of her home, chased by Ahmad. She's able to temporarily make headway, but runs into her old stalker instead. Giving up, she tells the stalker to kill her like he wants to - Ahmad intervenes and is stabbed instead. This is the incident that has landed him in the ICU at the beginning of the movie. As Fereshtah finishes telling her story to Roya, the phone rings and they are informed of Ahmad's death. Fereshteh is upset yet for the first time in years she sees a hopeful light ahead. She says she didn't want Ahmad to die despite all he did, but now that he is dead she has so much to do - go back to university, earn and be both parents to her sons. With increasing excitement she talks about reading books, learning to drive, learning computers. Finally she asks Roya to help her find books about single mothers raising their children alone.  Fereshteh: My family does not like a girl to enter the police station. No, it is not fair. We need to make our own group.<br> Roya: Which group?<br> Fereshteh: A group which belongs to us. Apachi Girls! What do you think?<br> Roya: You're Crazy. <br> Fereshteh: World does not work like that! We should not stand seeing a stubborn boy bothering and insulting us in the street and saying nothing. We need to make ourselves powerful. We need to learn karate. We need to work out and do body building. <br> The above dialogue is of the scenes of the movie Two Women in which two friends are talking about creating a group in order to gain power to protect themselves as the weaker gender. Being built in 1999, the film reflects the patriarchal society of Iran after Islamic Republic when the men used to shape and limit all the aspects of a woman life such as her education, career, life-style, goals, and marriage. Unlike all the previous films in the cinema of Iran, the leading character of the Two women (Do Zan) is a lady naming Fereshteh which means angel. Instead of showing her as a typical housewife whose only goal is to feed the demands of her father and husband, the film focuses on the subjectivity of Fereshteh as a rebellion, too far from the meaning of angel and an ideal Persian woman, who is adventurous, literate, decisive, and purposeful. She thinks independently and she works as a teacher not only to use her knowledge but also to help her family financially which is so uncommon of a woman at her time. For the very first time, Milani directs the film based on the total presence of a woman, her feelings and thoughts, and shows the world how the a woman's life is objectified by men trying to govern her life in a patriarchal society and how the men can turn a strong, independent woman to a helpless, broken one.  Tahmineh Milani was born in 1960. She is a professional film director, screenwriter, and producer who came to the limelight by breaking all the traditional and conventional norms about women and their presence in Iran's society. Being sentenced to prison have not stopped her from expressing their feminist ideas freely and finally her style has become a canon against which other feminist works would be evaluated."], "neg": ["Two Women\nTwo Women Two Women ( , roughly translated as \"The Woman from Ciociaria\") is a 1960 Italian film directed by Vittorio De Sica. It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The film stars Sophia Loren, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Raf Vallone, Eleonora Brown, Carlo Ninchi, and Andrea Checchi. The film was adapted by De Sica and Cesare Zavattini from the novel of the same name written by Alberto Moravia. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of July 1943 in Rome and rural Lazio, and during what the Italians call the \"Marocchinate\". Cesira is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta, in Rome during World War II. In July 1943, following the Allied bombing of Rome, mother and daughter flee to Cesira's native Ciociaria, a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira sleeps with Giovanni, a coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence. After they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele, a young local intellectual with communist sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by German soldiers, who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain. After the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of \"Moroccan Goumiers\" – soldiers attached to the invading Allied Armies in Italy. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child. When the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child. The film was based on a 1957 novel by Alberto Moravia, \"La ciociara\" (\"The Woman From Ciociara\"). It was inspired by Moravia's experiences during World War II. Carlo Ponti bought the film rights along with Marcello Girosi for a reported US$100,000. Sophia Loren was always meant to star and there was some talk that the film might be financed by Paramount, with whom Loren had made a number of movies. Anna Magnani was going to play the lead and Loren was going to be her daughter. George Cukor was going to direct as part of a two-picture deal with Ponti, the other one being \"Heller in Pink Tights\" (1960). The film was going to be shot as part of a six-picture deal between Ponti and Paramount.  Cukor and Paramount dropped out. Vittorio De Sica became attached as director. Magnani pulled out, supposedly because she did not want to play Loren's mother, leading to Loren taking Magnani's role, even though the former was only 26 at the time. However, De Sica says it was his decision for Loren to play Magnani's role and cast a younger performer as the daughter \"for great poignancy. If, in doing this, we moved away from original line of Moravia, we had better opportunity to stress, to underline, the monstrous impact of war on people. The historical truth is that the great majority of those raped were young girls.\" In a 2017 interview, Brown stated that Loren protected her from some of the underlying implications of the rape scene in the film, and also stated that director De Sica brought her to tears for the climatic final scene of hearing that Belmondo's character has died, by saying that a telegram had arrived saying that Brown's parents had died in an accident. Magnani said she was going to do it, \"Moravia wanted me, but Ponti got it, and Moravia did not fight. After that, they went through all the roles I'd turned down for Sophia Loren to play.\" \"The book was one of the most beautiful I've ever read\", said Loren. \"I thought it was worth taking the risk at 25 to play an older woman because the story was so beautiful.\"  Loren later said her performance was inspired by her memories of her mother during the war. She also said she was greatly helped by her experience acting in \"Desire Under the Elms\" (1958). Ponti raised money from France and Italy. French investment was conditional upon a French star being used, which lead to the casting of Jean Paul Belmondo, who had leapt to international fame in \"Breathless\" (1960). Belmondo's voice was dubbed into Italian. Joseph E. Levine agreed to buy US release rights after watching only nine minutes of the film. \"I bet Sophia she'd win the Oscar and I nursed that film like a baby\", Levine later said. He showed the film in every city that a member of the Academy jury lived and promoted it assiduously. \"That showed foreign films could get big audiences if promoted with flair\", said Levine. The movie was among the 30 most popular films at the French box office that year. The film won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Sophia Loren, due largely to heavy promotion by its North American distributor, Joseph E. Levine. This was the first time an acting Oscar had been given for a non-English-speaking performance, although she made the English dubbing for her role herself. Loren was too nervous to attend the ceremony and elected to stay in Rome instead. Greer Garson accepted the award on Loren's behalf.  Loren also won the award for Best Actress at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. Loren won 22 international awards for \"Two Women\". \"La Ciociara\" was remade for television in 1988. It was adapted by Diana Gould, Lidia Ravera, Dino Risi, and Bernardino Zapponi. It was directed by Risi, and starred Loren, Robert Loggia, Leonardo Ferrantini, Dario Ghirardi, and Sydney Penny. An opera, La Ciociara, in a re-write by scenario writer Luca Rossi, with music composed by Marco Tutino, received its premiere at San Francisco Opera, and a European premiere at Teatro Lirico, Cagliari."]}

Facilities are on the historic campus of Washington and Lee University in Sydney Lewis Hall. W&L Law has a total enrollment of approximately 365 students in the Juris Doctor program and a 6-to-1 student to faculty ratio. The Lexington Law School, the precursor to W&L Law, was founded in 1849 by United States federal judge John White Brockenbrough and is the 16th oldest active law school in the United States and the third-oldest in Virginia. The Law School was not integrated into Washington and Lee University (then known as Washington College) until after the Civil War when Robert E. Lee was president of the university. In 1866, General Lee annexed the school, known at the time as the School of Law and Equity, to the college and appointed Judge Brockenbrough as the first dean. In 1870, after Lee's death, the School of Law and Equity was renamed as the Washington and Lee University School of Law, in line with the college's name change in honor of General Lee. Also in 1870, former Virginia Attorney General John Randolph Tucker was appointed to the faculty and later became Dean followed by his son Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. In 1900, the law school moved into the newly built Tucker Hall in memory of Dean Tucker. Tucker Hall also housed the law school's first law library—the Vincent L. Bradford Law Library. After significant periods of growth, the law school moved into new Tucker Hall after the original building was destroyed in a fire and the law library was rebuilt with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. In 1920, W&L Law joined the Association of American Law Schools. The \"Washington and Lee Law Review\" began publication in the Autumn of 1939 and is still in regular publication. After World War II, enrollment increased despite a period of low enrollment during the war. In 1950, the School of Law established its chapter of the Order of the Coif, one of only 80 such chapters in the country. The School of Law admitted its first female students in 1972, and opened its current home, Sydney Lewis Hall, in 1977. In 1992, the Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing was added to Sydney Lewis Hall and the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library at a dedication ceremony attended by Justice Powell and presided over by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. In 2008, Dean Rodney Smolla announced the new third-year program, which became compulsory for W&L Law students in 2011 under Interim Dean Mark Grunewald. This new program turned the entire third year into an experiential curriculum which emphasizes practice, professionalism, and service. Nora Demleitner served as Dean from 2012 through 2015, the only woman to hold the position, during which time the school completed its $35 million campaign, \"Honor Our Past, Build Our Future\", renovated Lewis Hall, established the Washington, DC portion of W&L's third-year program, and significantly increased the employment and bar passage rates of its graduates. On July 1, 2015, Brant J. Hellwig became Dean of the law school, the 18th Dean since 1849. Also in 2015, W&L Law formed an academic and professional partnership with the Future of Privacy Forum, an information privacy think tank in Washington, DC. The Future of Privacy Forum will facilitate professional, research, and curricular development and the Washington, DC portion of W&L's third-year program will move into its offices. Sydney Lewis Hall is the home of the school of law on the historic campus of Washington and Lee in Lexington, Virginia. Lewis Hall was built in 1977 with a $9 million gift from Best Products founder Sydney Lewis and his wife Frances of Virginia. Lewis Hall was designed by Marcellus Wright Cox & Smith Architects in the Mid-century modern style. In addition to lecture halls, classrooms, and offices for faculty and staff, Lewis Hall houses the 150-seat Millhiser Moot Courtroom with the accompanying Robert E. Stroud Judge's Chambers and the Roger D. Groot Jury Room. The Millhiser Moot Courtroom serves as the continuity of operations site for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Lewis Hall also has a cafeteria for students, staff, and faculty called the Brief Stop, which serves food, snacks, and drinks. As part of its recently completed $35 million campaign, \"Honor Our Past, Build Our Future\", the School of Law began an $8 million renovation and modernization project in the summer of 2014 and completed in the summer of 2015. The project resulted in more flexible space for student collaboration and study, new homes for four of the school's legal clinics and student organizations, more natural lighting, a new library reading room, a new high-tech trial courtroom, and an improved entry sequence and navigation for the building. Lewis Hall's cornerstones are the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library and Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing. The Wilbur C. Hall Law Library is a Federal Depository Library for the U.S. Government and includes a separate faculty library, a rare book room, and an audio-visual media center and is open 24-hours a day. The library houses more than 492,000 volumes and is unique in offering each student personally designated work and storage space. The Powell Wing was built in 1992 to house the professional and personal papers and archives of the United States Supreme Court Justice and noted W&L alum as well as other manuscript collections, rare books, and archives of the law school. The Powell Wing includes an expanded main reading room space, in addition to stack area and work space for the papers. The archives are managed by full-time staff and are open to researchers, faculty, and students.

During the period of the British Raj, the city was the capital of Dhrangadhra State, one of the eight first-class princely states (13-gun salute) of the Kathiawar Agency in the Bombay Presidency. In Sanskrit \"dhrang\" means a stone, and \"dhara\" means the earth. It is believed that because of the strong and widespread yellow stone bedrock found immediately under the soil of the place, the town is thus named. Dhrangadhra has a long history starting from Lower Paleolithic Period. The River named Falku is passing from Dhrangadhra town. The evidence come from the river bed of the Bhadar river which flows along with the Dhragadhra taluka. Moreover, there are lots of sites spreading over the vast land belonging to Harappan Period. Recent studies in the area suggests that the Dhragadhra and Halvad taluka was the frontier of the so-called sorat Harappans which bifurcates the Sidhi Harrapans of Kutch & Sindh. These are recent studies made by Arun Malik, a PhD scholar of The M.S. University of Baroda and now he is with Archaeological Survey of India. Modern history  Dhrangadhra grew from Jhalawad Princely State, which was founded about AD 1090. This state was ruled by the Jhala Rajputs. In 1735, Dhrangadhra was founded as its capital. The state was then renamed \"Dhrangadhra-Halvad state\" from the initial name of \"Kuwa, Halwad\". In 1941 the princely state of Dhrangadhra had a population of 94,417 living in an area of 1,167 square miles. In 1925, India's first soda ash factory was founded in Dhrangadhra. It was taken over by Shreyans Prasad Jain, who established the Dhrangadhra Chemical Works (now known as DCW) in 1939. Now,DCW is the largest industry there, and is the main source of employment. In 1948, the state of Dhrangadhra was made part of the Jhalawad district in Saurashtra. In 1956 it became part of Gujarat.

The territory and inhabitants were described by Tacitus in Germania in  98, where Suebi, Goths and other Germanic people lived on both sides of the Vistula River, adjacent to the Aesti (further east). About 800 to 900 years later the Aesti were named Old Prussians, who, since 997, repeatedly defended themselves against take-over attempts by the newly created Duchy of the Polans. The territory of the Old Prussians and neighboring Curonians and Livonians was unified politically in the 1230s as the Teutonic Order State. Prussia was politically divided between 1466 and 1772, with western Prussia under protection of the Crown of Poland and eastern Prussia a Polish–Lithuanian fief until 1660. The unity of both parts of Prussia remained preserved by retaining its borders, citizenship and autonomy until western and eastern Prussia were also politically reunited under the German Kingdom of Prussia (which despite the name was based in Berlin, Brandenburg). It is famous for many lakes, as well as forests and hills. Since the military conquest of the area by the Soviet Army in 1945 and the expulsion of the German-speaking inhabitants it was divided between northern Poland (most of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship), Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, and southwestern Lithuania (Klaipėda Region). The former German kingdom and later state of Prussia (1701–1947) derived its name from the region. The area was settled by the bearers of the Corded Ware culture in the 4th millennium . These were presumably the early Indo-European speakers, which in the Baltic would diversify into the satem Balto-Slavic branch which would ultimately give rise to the Balts as the speakers of the Baltic languages. The Balts would have become differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts in the late 1st millennium . The region was inhabited by ancestors of Western Balts – Old Prussians, Sudovians/Jotvingians, Scalvians, Nadruvians, and Curonians while the eastern Balts settled in what is now Lithuania, Latvia and Belarus). The Greek explorer Pytheas (4th century ) may have referred to the territory as \"Mentenomon\" and to the inhabitants as \"Guttones\" (neighbours of the \"Teutones\", probably referring to the Goths). A river to the east of the Vistula was called the \"Guttalus\", perhaps corresponding to the Nemunas, the Łyna, or the Pregola. In  98 Tacitus described one of the tribes living near the Baltic Sea () as \"Aestiorum gentes\" and amber-gatherers. The Vikings started to penetrate the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea in the 7th and 8th centuries. The largest trade centres of the Prussians, such as Truso and Kaup, seem to have absorbed a number of Norse people. Prussians used the Baltic Sea as a trading route, frequently travelling from Truso to Birka (in present-day Sweden). At the end of the Viking Age, the sons of Danish kings Harald Bluetooth and Cnut the Great launched several expeditions against the Prussians. They destroyed many areas in Prussia, including Truso and Kaup, but failed to dominate the population totally. A Viking (Varangian) presence in the area was \"less than dominant and very much less than imperial.\" According to a legend, recorded by Simon Grunau, the name \"Prussia\" is derived from Pruteno (or Bruteno), the chief priest of Prussia and brother of the legendary king Widewuto, who lived in the 6th century. The regions of Prussia and the corresponding tribes are said to bear the names of Widewuto's sons — for example, Sudovia is named after Widewuto's son Sudo. The territory was probably identified as \"Brus\" in the 8th-century map of the Bavarian Geographer. In New Latin the area is called \"Borussia\" and its inhabitants \"Borussi\". The Old Prussians spoke a variety of languages, with Old Prussian belonging to the Western branch of the Baltic language group. Old Prussian, or related Western Baltic dialects, may have been spoken as far southeast as Masovia and even Belarus in the early medieval period, but these populations would probably have undergone Slavicization before the 10th century. Meanwhile, the big part of later Prussia, west of the Vistula and south of the Osa, has been inhabited by Lechitic (Polish and Pomeranian) tribes. In the first half of the 13th century, Bishop Christian of Prussia recorded the history of a much earlier era. Adam of Bremen mentions Prussians in 1072. After the Christianisations of the West Slavs in the 10th century, the state of the Polans was established and there were first attempts at conquering and baptizing the Baltic peoples. Bolesław I Chrobry sent Adalbert of Prague in 997 on a military and Christianizing mission. Adalbert, accompanied by armed guards, attempted to convert the Prussians to Christianity. He was killed by a Prussian pagan priest in 997.  In 1015, Bolesław sent soldiers again, with some short-lived success, gaining regular paid tribute from some Prussians in the border regions, but it did not last. Polish rulers sent invasions to the territory in 1147, 1161–1166, and a number of times in the early 13th century. While these were repelled by the Prussians, the Chełmno Land became exposed to their frequent raids. At that time, Pomerelia belonged to the diocese of Włocławek, while Chełmno belonged to the diocese of Płock. In the beginning of the 13th century, Konrad of Mazovia had called for Crusades and tried for years to conquer Prussia, but failed. Thus the pope set up further crusades. Finally the Duke invited the Teutonic Knights to fight the inhabitants of Prussia in exchange for a fief of Chełmno Land. Prussia was conquered by the Teutonic Knights during the Prussian Crusade and administered within their Teutonic Order state, which begins the process of Germanization in the area. After the acquisition of Pomerelia in 1308–1310, the meaning of the term \"Prussia\" was widened to include areas west of the Vistula. The city of Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad) was founded in 1255, and joined the Hanseatic League in 1340. Danzig (Gdańsk) followed in 1361. From this time Prussia was connected to the trade network spanning throughout the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. With the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), Prussia was divided into eastern and western parts. The western part became the province of Royal Prussia adjacent to the Kingdom of Poland, while the eastern part of the monastic state became a fief of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1492, a life of Saint Dorothea of Montau, published in Marienburg (Malbork), became the first printed publication in Prussia. During the Protestant Reformation, endemic religious upheavals and wars occurred, and in 1525, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Brandenburg, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, adopted the Lutheran faith, resigned his position, and assumed the title of \"Duke of Prussia\". In a deal partially brokered by Martin Luther, the Duchy of Prussia became the first Protestant state and a vassal of Poland. The ducal capital of Königsberg, now Kaliningrad, became a centre of learning and printing through the establishment of the Albertina University in 1544 for not only the dominant German culture, but also the thriving Polish and Lithuanian communities as well. It was in Königsberg that the first Lutheran books in Polish, Lithuanian, and Prussian languages were published. Rulership of Ducal Prussia passed to the senior Hohenzollern branch, the ruling Margraves of Brandenburg, in 1618, and Polish sovereignty over the duchy ended in 1657 with the Treaty of Wehlau. Because Ducal Prussia lay outside of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick I achieved the elevation of the duchy to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. The former ducal lands became known as East Prussia. In Royal Prussia, an autonomous region, under the King of Poland-Lithuania the official language was still German. Its population was partly Polish Catholic (Chełmno Land, Kociewie, Kashubia and Sztum) and partly German Protestant (Thorn/Toruń, Gdańsk/Danzig, the Żuławy Wiślane and Elbląg/Elbing). Gdańsk had about 50,000 inhabitants, while even Kraków had only 20,000. Toruń and Elbląg were also large cities, with 10,000 burghers. Gdańsk and the Żuławy Wiślane were partly Dutch, with some Calvinists and Mennonites. Lithuanian culture thrived in the western part of the region known as Lithuania Minor, while the Kursenieki lived along the coast in the vicinity of the Curonian and Vistula Spits. Royal Prussia was annexed from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Kingdom of Prussia during the late 18th-century Partitions of Poland and administered within West Prussia. The Old Prussian language had mostly disappeared by 1700. The last speakers may have died in the plague and famine that ravaged Prussia in 1709 to 1711. After unifying the region of Prussia into one state, it became a single province, later divided again into West and East. Also the northernmost area of Greater Poland (Sępólno Krajeńskie, Złotów and Wałcz) was adjoined to it. Its population was still partly Polish and partly German, partly Catholic and partly Lutheran (both divisions overlapping especially in the west). Though the Kingdom of Prussia was a member of the German Confederation from 1815 to 1866, the provinces of Posen and Prussia were not a part of Germany until the creation of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. By the Treaty of Versailles, most of West Prussia that had belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia since the Partitions of Poland which began in 1772. and the German Empire were ceded to the Second Polish Republic. Danzig became a free city under the protection of the League of Nations. East Prussia, minus the Memelland, received some districts of former West Prussia and remained within the German Weimar Republic. According to the Potsdam Conference in 1945 after World War II, the German part of Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, which divided its part further between the Lithuanian SSR and the Russian SFSR. Warmia and Masuria are now in Poland, while northern East Prussia (minus the former Memelland which is now the Klaipėda region of Lithuania) forms the Kaliningrad Oblast exclave of the Russian Federation.

He saw active service in the First World War and spent the end of that war as a prisoner in England. His interest in climbing continued as he studied law in Munich. Travelling on a tight budget with friends he tackled many of the classic climbs in central Europe. In 1928 he visited the Caucasus with three friends, where they climbed to the summit of Dykh-Tau – second highest peak in Europe. In 1929 he led a team of nine German Mountaineers in a first attempt on Kangchenjunga. They acquitted themselves well, but were turned back by poor weather and bad conditions having reached 26,000 feet. Returning in 1931, Bauer's team were again rebuffed by the sheer size and scale of the Mountain. It was during this second attempt on Kangchenjunga, that Hermann Schaller lost his life. In 1932 Bauer won a gold medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his \"Am Kangehenzonga\", an account of his 1931 attempt to climb the Himalayan peak Kangchenjunga.

Workshops were the only places of production until the advent of industrialization and the development of larger factories. In the 20th and 21st century, many Western homes contain a workshop in the garage, basement, or an external shed. Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools and other hardware. Along with their practical applications for repair goods or do small manufacturing runs, workshops are used to tinker and make prototypes.  Workshops may vary in industrial focus. For instance, some workshops may focus on automotive repair or restoration. Woodworking is one of the most common focuses, but metalworking, electronics work, and many types of electronic prototyping may be done. In some repair industries, such as locomotives and aircraft, the repair operations have specialized workshops called back shops or railway workshops.

Founded in 1972, Glasgow Print Studio is an organisation with charitable status that exists to encourage and promote the art of printmaking; it is supported by the Creative Scotland and Glasgow City Council. Providing facilities for the production of etchings, relief prints and screenprints, Glasgow Print Studio has a membership of over 300 artists who use the custom-built printmakers workshop. The Studio also has two exhibition spaces hosting an exhibitions programme. It also runs a learning programme focused on teaching and developing understanding of fine art printmaking. As well as providing subsidised printmaking facilities to artists, the Studio also supports its artist members by promoting and selling their art work in the gallery, on its web site and at international art fairs. The Studio also has a print publishing programme, where an artist is invited to the studio to work with a master printmaker to make an edition of original prints. It has worked with a range of Scottish and international artists, including Elizabeth Blackadder, John Byrne, Peter Howson, Christine Borland, Alasdair Gray. These publications can be seen in the gallery and on the Studio's web site.  History:  In 1972 a group of graduates from Glasgow School of Art set up Glasgow Print Studio in a flat in Finnieston. Finding nowhere that they could continue printmaking after graduation, they were supported by the Glasgow School of Art's Head of Printmaking, Philip Reeves, to establish their own workshop. As membership of the organisation increased, the 1976 move to Ingram Street in the city centre provided a larger workshop plus a gallery. Here, artists had a space to sell their work and the programme ranged from contemporary print to the popular Scottish Cartoonists exhibition and a retrospective by LS Lowry. At Ingram Street, the Print Studio was at the centre of a social and artistic whirl. Bands played and plays were performed in the gallery, while the Print Studio Press published books by Scottish writers including Liz Lochead and Alasdair Gray. The Studio also organised an annual Midsummer Ball, which became a key event in Glasgow’s social calendar. Fruitful relationships have developed with established artists such as Elizabeth Blackadder, Adrian Wiszniewski, Scott Myles, Jim Lambie, Claire Barclay, Ciara Philips and John Byrne, who work collaboratively with the Studio’s master printers. The Studio offers both traditional and digital printing facilities and uses its expertise to work with contemporary galleries like The Modern Institute.

It was founded by artist Nancy David, a former printmaking instructor assisting Marilyn Bevilaqua at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts studio school, and Gail McKennis, an American British-trained artist/printmaker who was the owner of Scott-McKennis Gallery in Richmond's Carytown, where she showed prints-- especially etchings--by artists such as Kathe Kollwitz, David Freed, and Chris Orr. Other directors included Laura Pharis, later of the Sweet Briar College art faculty, and Mary Holland, who later became the director of the Museum Studio School at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and one of the founders of the ONE/OFF Printmakers Group. Founded in 1978 with conceptual beginnings in 1977, the workshop was located at 1529 West Cary Street on the first floor of a former funeral home owned by Nancy David and her husband John David. The workshop had letterpress equipment and etching and lithography presses. The workshop offered facilities and instruction for letterpress, mezzotint, linocut, papermaking, paper marbling, and book arts. An exhibition of women artists who worked at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop included Laura Pharis, Mary Holland, Willie Anne Wright, and Barbara Tisserat. When the Richmond Printmaking Workshop dissolved in 1991, a collection of 253 prints by fifty-seven RPW artists was presented to the Hand Workshop (now the Visual Arts Center) in Richmond. In 2001, the Hand Workshop transferred the collection to the Joel and Lila Harnett Print Study Center at the University of Richmond Museum. After the dissolution of the RPW, its artists who formed the group ONE/OFF Printmakers continued to produce print portfolios and to exhibit their group shows both nationally and internationally until 2017.  A result of moving the RPW to the Hand Workshop, was the increase of printmaking instructors, classes, and workshops at the Hand Workshop (now VisArts). The RPW began collaborative exchange portfolios of members' prints, a tradition which later continued with ONE/OFF Printmakers and Studio Two Three, both also based in Richmond. In 2002 One/Off Printmakers held an open house at the Hand Workshop printmaking studio. The artists giving printmaking demonstrations were Jack Glover, Ann Chenoweth, and Mitzi Humphrey. Other artists from One/Off discussed and showed examples of various other printmaking processes. Concurrently with the demonstrations, an exhibition from Pyramid Atlantic was on display in the Hand Workshop gallery. The RPW partnered with Richmond City Public Schools in offering printmaking workshops and sponsoring scholarships for talented teens. In 1983 the workshop produced the first color cover for the Richmond Independent Press and published several covers that year. Among the artists who were instructors at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop were Master Printer David Adamson from England (at the invitation of Laura Pharis), woodcut artist and \"Paint Pot Alley\" host of children's television Jack Glover, and book artists Bruce Schnabel, John Field, and Carol Barton. Funding for the RPW after achieving its non-profit organization 501-C3 status came from other artists in the community, private donors, studio rental, and workshop tuition. The workshop drew participation from Virginia museums and galleries as well as collaboration from both the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts."]}

Series creator Peter Nowalk is responsible for creating and developing the character, and American actress Viola Davis portrays Keating since the show's inception. Annalise is introduced as a high-profile criminal defense attorney and law professor at Middleton University who maintains social prestige and navigates through a complex personality. The series' main narrative starts when Annalise chooses five of her students to work with her and they get in the middle of a murder case. Throughout the series' course, Annalise is very protective of her students, who become her allies, and is balancing between her personal life and the public scrutiny. On February 25, 2014, it was announced that Viola Davis was cast in the show's leading role of Professor Annalise Keating. Annalise is introduced as a self-sufficient and confident woman who seems to have a perfect life and is respected for her professionalism, who people both fear and admire. Throughout the series, she experiences emotional changes and her alcohol addiction increases as she gets involved in multiple crimes with her associates. Annalise was born Anna Mae Harkness, the daughter of Ophelia and Mac, and the sister of Celestine and Thelonious. Her father was absent during much of her life. As a child, she was sexually abused by her uncle Clyde, who was living with them, and Ophelia watched the happening, which led her to take her children away and burn down the house with Clyde inside. At law school, Annalise started a relationship with Eve Rothlo, but they broke up after Annalise fell in love with Sam Keating, who was married and left his wife to marry Annalise. This season is set chronologically before and after the murder of Sam Keating. In flashbacks, Annalise is introduced as a criminal defense teacher at Middleton University who chooses students Laurel Castillo, Michaela Pratt, Connor Walsh, Asher Millstone, and Wes Gibbins to work exclusively in her law firm, where she is assisted by associates Frank Delfino and Bonnie Winterbottom. The body of Lila Stangard, a student who had been missing for months, is found and eventually it is revealed that Annalise's husband Sam was having an affair with Lila before she died. Lila's best friend Rebecca Sutter gets romantically involved with Gibbins while the local police department is investigating both Sutter and Lila's ex-boyfriend Griffin O'Reilly. When Sam starts suspecting that Rebecca is aware of his affair with Lila, he becomes violent towards her and attacks her one night when she tries to transfer his laptop data to a flash drive. Gibbins, Walsh, Pratt and Castillo appear to help Rebecca and during the showdown Michaela pushes Sam over the banister and onto the floor below. Sam is presumed dead, and the five ponder their next move, only to have Sam leap up and attack Rebecca. Wes clobbers Sam on the head with a trophy, killing him. The five burn his body in the woods under Annalise's complicity, who is aware of the murder and helps them to build up an alibi. In flash-forwards, Annalise deals with the police investigating Sam's whereabouts, which Annalise makes it looks connected to Lila's death by making their affair public. Sam's sister Hannah Keating arrives in town searching for the truth and accusing Annalise of lying. The remains of Sam are found and Annalise incriminates her lover Nate Lahey as a way to avoid her student's arrest. However, she tries to help him go free by offering him a number of a fellow lawyer. She calls her mother to counsel her throughout this moment, though they have multiple arguments. One night, Wes calls her frightened ans asks her to go to his apartment. There, she finds him and the others and learns that they strapped Rebecca with tape and locked her in the bathroom. Subsequently, the group takes Rebecca to the Keatings' household's basement, where they keep her while trying to build a case against her, framing her of killing Lila, a theory that they start believing when multiples proofs show up. When they decide to let her go after not finding anything concrete, Rebecca is gone.

He was a delegate for New York to the Continental Congress (1779 to 1783) and again in 1788. His national offices overlapped with those he served in the state: in the State Assembly (1777-1783) and in the state senate (1784-1792) and (1794-1809); he was a member of the state constitutional convention in 1801. He also served in local offices, as clerk of Suffolk County from January 1784 to March 1810 and from March 1811 until his death that year. He was a regent of the University of the State of New York. Representing the New York City Chamber of Commerce to gain federal support, L'Hommedieu chose the site for the Montauk Point Lighthouse and designed it in 1796; it was the first to be built in the state. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012. Ezra L'Hommedieu was born in Southold, Long Island to Benjamin and Martha (Bourn) L'Hommedieu; they were of Dutch, English and French Huguenot ancestry. He was a great-grandson of, among others, English immigrants Nathaniel and Grizzell (Brinley) Sylvester, who had owned all of Shelter Island (8,000 acres) in the 17th century. He was privately educated before going to Yale College, where he graduated in 1754. He read law and established a law practice in Southold and New York City. As a lawyer, L'Hommedieu came to consider British tax legislation oppressive and even \"illegal.\" He became caught up in revolutionary fervor, moving from Long Island to Connecticut after occupation of the former in 1776 by the British, and aiding other refugees get to the northern shore. Although George Washington had promised Continental aid to the refugees, L'Hommedieu spent his own money to help support them. He became active in provincial and state politics, serving in the State Assembly (1777-1783) and in the state senate (1784-1792) and (1794-1809). He also served in local offices, as clerk of Suffolk County from January 1784 to March 1810, and from March 1811 until his death that year. He was appointed by the New York Assembly as the state representative to the Continental Congress, serving 1779-1783 and in 1788. He continued to be politically active and in 1801 was a delegate to the state constitutional convention. L'Hommedieu was a candidate in 1789 to become one of New York's first two United States senators, to be elected by the state legislature. In the midst of a procedural stalemate in July of that year, the New York Council of Revision held that the state assembly and senate, respectively, should name candidates until both houses concurred on two nominees. The senate confirmed the assembly's choice of Philip Schuyler for one Senate seat but rejected its second nominee, James Duane, proposing L'Hommedieu in Duane's stead. The assembly rejected L'Hommedieu by a 34-24 vote. Rufus King was thereafter approved by both houses for the second Senate seat. Widely respected for his integrity and intelligence, L'Hommedieu represented the New York City Chamber of Commerce in discussions related to a lighthouse at Montauk Point, a federal project on which he advised President George Washington. He made the case that New York City \"was first among American ports in the volume of its foreign commerce. By 1797, the harbor was handling a third of the nation’s trade with other countries.\" Because of the prevailing winds in winter, New York needed the lighthouse to aid ships approaching its harbor. L'Hommedieu chose the site for the lighthouse and designed it. Constructed in 1796, it was the first lighthouse built in New York state and the first public works project of the new United States. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2012. L'Hommedieu also developed methods of scientific farming, including the use of seashells to fertilize soils. He corresponded on farming with Thomas Jefferson, particularly about crop pests. He married Charity Floyd on December 24, 1756 (\"The Salmon Records: A private record of marriages and deaths of the residents of Southold, Suffolk County, NY,\" Robbins, William A.

Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he was elected a Fellow of Merton College in 1624. He studied Persian and Arabic, acquired a number of old books & manuscripts for archbishop William Laud (some still in Merton College Library), and wrote a treatise (in Latin) on the Persian language. He travelled in Italy and the Levant from 1636 to 1640 and made a survey of the Great Pyramid of Giza. He was Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London, and Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford University, and collected astrolabes and astronomical measuring devices (now in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford). He was particularly interested in the study of weights and measures, and wrote a treatise on the Roman foot and denarius, and was a keen numismatist. In 1645 he attempted a reform of the Julian calendar in 1645 which was not adopted. During the English Civil War he supported Charles I, who stayed at Merton College while in Oxford, but lost his academic positions at Oxford in 1647 through the animosity of Nathaniel Brent, Warden of Merton College and a Parliamentarian. He was born in Colemore, near Alresford, Hampshire. He was the eldest son of John Greaves, rector of Colemore, and Sarah Greaves. His brothers were Nicholas Greaves, Thomas Greaves and Sir Edward Greaves, physician to Charles II. His father ran a school for sons of the neighbouring gentry, where Greaves began his education. Aged 15, he went to Balliol College, Oxford between 1617–1621, gaining a B.A. degree. In 1624 he was the first of five newly elected Fellows of Merton College, becoming M.A. in 1628. He began to study astronomy and oriental languages, and especially the works of the ancient eastern astronomers. In 1630 Greaves was chosen Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London. Through his predecessor, Peter Turner, he later met archbishop William Laud, the chancellor of Oxford University and Visitor (patron) of Merton College. Laud was keen to make English editions of Greek and Arabic authors, and Greaves' later travels abroad involved collecting manuscripts and books for presentation to his new patron. Greaves enrolled at University of Leyden in 1633, where he became friends with Jacob Golius, professor of Arabic at Leyden. He enrolled at the University of Padua in 1635 along with George Ent, meeting the Dane Johan Rode (John Rhodius), an expert on ancient weights and measures, who also made a commentary on Celsus. A brief return to England was followed by a second European journey; in 1636 he sailed via Livorno (Leghorn) to Rome, dining with Ent on 5 October at the English College, Rome; he also met William Harvey, who was entertained at the College on the 12th, Gasparo Berti, Lucas Holstenius and Athanasius Kircher.  Probably in the same month he met and consulted with the Earl of Arundel's art-collecting agent, William Petty (who dined at the College on 14 October), on the Earl's attempted acquisition of the Obelisk of Domitian, then still lying broken in the Circus of Maxentius. Though 'now it is broken into 5 stones' he measured these and including a sketch of the obelisk as hypothetically repaired in his almanac-notebook (Bodleian Library Savile MS 49,1). Though Arundel paid a 60 crown deposit for the obelisk, pope Urban VIII vetoed its export and it was erected by his successor Innocent X above Bernini's \"Fountain of the Four Rivers\" in the Piazza Navona. Greaves toured the Catacombs and made drawings of the Pantheon and Pyramid of Cestius. During his stay in Rome he instituted inquiries into the ancient weights and measures that are among the early classics of metrology. In 1637 he made a journey to the Levant, one intention being to fix the latitude of Alexandria where Ptolemy had made his astronomical observations. He sailed from England to Livorno in the company of Edward Pococke; after a brief visit to Rome, he arrived in Istanbul (Constantinople) around April 1638. There he made the acquaintance of the English ambassador Sir Peter Wyche. He procured various manuscripts there, including a copy of Ptolemy's Almagest (\"the fairest work I ever saw\"). Greaves ended up owning two copies of the Almagest. He was going to have visited the many monastic libraries at Mount Athos, in order to make a catalogue of their MSS and unprinted books. Athos was normally open only to members of the Orthodox church, but thanks to a special dispensation from the Patriarch of Constantinople Cyril Lucaris, Greaves would have had access; but the execution of the patriarch by strangulation in June 1638 for treason against Sultan Murad IV prevented his journey. Instead, Greaves continued on to Alexandria, where he collected a number of Arabic, Persian and Greek manuscripts. He was an inveterate note-taker, making countless observations in notebooks and on blank pages of other books he bought; he also visited Cairo twice, and made a more accurate survey of the pyramids of Egypt than any traveller who had preceded him. He returned to England in 1640. On the death of John Bainbridge in 1643, Greaves was appointed as Savilian professor of astronomy and senior reader of the Linacre lecture at Oxford, but he was deprived of his Gresham professorship for having neglected its duties. In 1645 he essayed a reformation of the Julian calendar; but although his plan of omitting the bissextile day (29 February) for the next 40 years was approved by the king, the matter was dropped owing to the turbulent times. The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in Britain until 1752. In 1642 Greaves had been elected subwarden of Merton College. Merton was the only Oxford college to side with the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War, through an earlier dispute in 1638 between Nathaniel Brent, the Warden of Merton, and Greaves' patron William Laud. Brent had been a witness for the prosecution at Laud's 1644 trial. After Laud was executed on 10 January 1645, Greaves drew up a petition for Brent's removal from office; Brent was deposed by Charles I on 27 January. However, in 1647 a Parliamentary commission (or visitation) was set up \"for the correction of offences, abuses, and disorders\" in the University of Oxford. Nathaniel Brent was the president of the visitors. After Thomas Fairfax had captured Oxford for the Parliamentarians in 1648 and Brent had returned from London, Greaves was accused of sequestrating the college's plate and funds for king Charles. Despite a deposition from his brother Thomas, Greaves had lost both his Merton fellowship and his Savilian chair by 9 November 1648. Many of his books and MSS disappeared after his rooms were rifled by soldiers, although his friend John Selden managed to recover some of them. However, Greaves was not actually deprived of the professorship until August 1649. He was succeeded as Savilian Professor of Astronomy in that year by Seth Ward, who ensured that Greaves was paid the arrears (£500) of his salary; Greaves was unlikely to have got his money, since the Savilian professors were paid from the income of lands held in Kent and Essex, which were under control of Parliament (rather than the king). Ward also gave over a considerable amount of his own salary to Greaves. But Greaves' private fortune more than sufficed for all his wants till his death; he retired to London, married and occupied his leisure writing and editing books and manuscripts. He died in London aged 50, and was buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog, which was destroyed during the Great Fire of London. His brother Nicholas Greaves was his executor. He left his cabinet containing his coin collection to Sir John Marsham, and his astronomical instruments to the university, for the use of the Savilian professors. Two of his astrolabes (inscribed by his brother Nicholas) are in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. (see External links) Greaves had entrusted his will to his friend and fellow-traveller in the Levant, the Arabic scholar Edward Pococke. The will had originally stipulated that Greaves' collection of astronomical instruments (astrolabes, quadrants, telescopes etc.) was to be left to Oxford university. But by 1649 Greaves (who was staying at Sir John Marsham's house in Rochester, Kent) had become increasingly exasperated with the academic situation at Oxford since the civil war. He wrote to Pococke asking to him to send the will to blot out his gift of his instruments to the university (which had cost him more than a hundred pounds), because he \"so far despaired of any future encouragement to learning and ingenuity in Oxford.\" Greaves repeated his request a few months later, asking Pococke to open the will and strike the words out himself. Pococke seems to have eventually complied with Greaves' wishes, since after Greaves' death in 1652 his executor and brother Nicholas Greaves kept hold of his late brother's collection. However, when the Commonwealth ended with the resignation of Richard Cromwell in 1659, Nicholas Greaves (in accordance with his late brother's original intent) presented the instruments - suitably inscribed - for the use of the Savilian Professors of Astronomy. They were kept in the professor's room at the top of the Eastern Tower of the Oxford Schools, now the Bodleian Library. A list of them appears in the 'Old Catalogue' of the Bodleian MSS In 1710 the collection was held in the Museum Savilianum.. The instruments had disappeared by the 1920s when R. T. Gunther, the first curator of the Oxford Museum of the History of Science, made inquiries into their whereabouts. Gunther listed them in his \"Early Science in Oxford, Vol. 2: Astronomy\" as \"not extant\". But in 1936 during the refurbishment of the University Radcliffe Observatory, he was alerted by the Savilian professor of Astronomy, H. H. Plaskett, to a chance discovery of \"certain old metal bars and plates behind some cases.\" These turned out to be part of the missing Savilian collection, including a mural quadrant, and an astrolabe of Queen Elizabeth I which Greaves took on his 1637-40 expedition to the Middle East. Gunther wrote two articles in \"The Observatory\" on his findings, one shorter preliminary report with a fuller appreciation a few months later. The inscriptions on four of the instruments (including Elizabeth I's astrolabe) read: Greaves' other, smaller astrolabe didn't surface until 1971, when it was discovered by Gunther's son A. E. Gunther at his mother's house. The cataloguer of the OMHS attributes this to an oversight on Gunther's part. The inscription around the edge of the limb reads: '1659 . Acad. Oxon. Ex dono Nic Greaves. S.T.D.' It doesn't appear in Gunther's 1932 magnum opus, \"Astrolabes of the World\".

He described himself as a \"sacred socialist\" and was an advocate of vegetarianism and other health practices. Pierrepont Greaves was born in Merton in Surrey, the son of Charles Greaves, a draper, and Ann Pierrepont, and spent his early life engaged as a merchant and draper in London. According to one account the firm in which he was a partner became bankrupt in 1806 owing to the Milan and Berlin decrees of Napoleon which blocked trade between Britain and the continent; another source says that \"after getting rich in commerce he lost his fortune by imprudent speculations\". At any rate, he surrendered all his property to his creditors, and lived for some time on the income allowed him for winding up the affairs of his establishment. He eventually rebuilt his business. In 1817, Greaves experienced \"some strong interior visitations\" which led him to a belief in the \"divine in man\" and convinced him that he had a spiritual mission in life to share his commitment to the love of God with others. In 1818, he joined Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, the Swiss educational reformer, then established at Yverdon, where he taught English. There he met fellow socialist Robert Owen. Returning to England in 1825 he founded the \"London Infant School Society\" and became its secretary. In 1832 he was settled in the village of Randwick, Gloucestershire, and engaged in an industrial scheme for the benefit of agricultural labourers with his sister Mary Ann Greaves. From the 1830s onwards he referred to himself as a \"sacred socialist\". Resuming his residence in London, he drew around him many friends. A philosophical society founded by him in 1836, and known as the \"Aesthetic Society\", met for some time at a house in Burton Street in Camden. His educational experiences gradually led him to his unconventional philosophical views. \"As Being is before knowing and doing, I affirm that education can never repair the defects of Birth\". Hence the necessity of \"the divine existence being developed and associated with man and woman prior to marriage\". He was a follower of Jacob Boehme and influenced by German transcendentalism. He was also influenced by Thomas Taylor, William Law and the philosophy of neoplatonism. Greaves worked with Charles and Elizabeth Mayo to found the Home and Colonial School Society in Gray’s Inn Road in 1836. This teaching institution was dedicated to Pestalozzi whose educational ideas ignored the idea of rote-learning. The new organization included a model infant school where these ideas could be developed. Greaves and his followers founded Alcott House, in Ham, Surrey (now in Richmond in Greater London), a utopian spiritual community and progressive school which lasted from 1838 to 1848. It was named after Amos Bronson Alcott, the American transcendentalist, with whom Greaves had a long correspondence, and who visited the community in 1842. Religious writer Francis Foster Barham (1808–1871), a member of Greaves' Aesthetic Society, considered him as essentially a superior man to Coleridge, and with much higher spiritual attainments and experience. He wrote, \"his numerous acquaintances regarded him as a moral phenomenon, as a unique specimen of human character, as a study, as a curiosity, and an absolute undefinable\". An acquaintance whom Greaves frequently visited observed that he was often in financial distress, as he did not attach great importance to conventional notions of earning a living. Greaves became a vegetarian, and advocated hydrotherapy, water drinking, and a life of celibacy. In his lifetime, he published none of his writings separately, but printed a few of them in obscure periodicals. His last years were spent at Alcott House, where he died on 11 March 1842, aged 65.

While all natural burials seek to prevent environmental damage done by conventional techniques, some go a step further by using burial fees to acquire land to restore native habitat and save endangered species. Such land management techniques are called \"conservation burials.\" In addition to restoration ecology, and habitat conservation projects, others have proposed alternative natural uses of the land such as sustainable agriculture and permaculture, to maintain the burial area in perpetuity. Landscaping methods may accelerate or slow down the decomposition rate of bodies, depending on the soil system. The first official conservation burial was established in the United States, however Natural Burial Grounds have been used previously in UK and the practice matches the methods used in many ancient and indigenous cultures. Many funeral directors encourage a viewing of a dead body at a commercial funeral home as part of a \"package\" that the family of the deceased pay for, without knowing that it is optional. The primary purpose of embalming is disinfection, and the secondary purpose is to halt decomposition long enough to allow the body to be viewed. In many countries, the law requires that dead bodies be chilled with dry ice or mechanical refrigeration to prevent microbial growth, though there are no laws mandating embalming, contrary to popular belief. Many cultures around the world use no artificial cooling at all, and bodies are regularly held for several days before their final disposal. Special circumstances, such as an extended time between death and burial, or the transportation of remains on commercial flights (which often require unembalmed bodies to travel in expensive specialized containers), may necessitate embalming. The most common embalming fluid is composed of organic chemicals and contains 5–29% formaldehyde, ethanol and water. This solution is biodegradable in time, but it cross-links proteins found in tissue-cell membranes, slowing down bacterial decomposition and inhibiting the body's breakdown in the earth. The ability of embalming fluid to contaminate soil or water tables has not been studied thoroughly. In alkaline soils, formaldehyde would be broken down through the Cannizzaro reaction and become urotropin, but not all soils are alkaline. Formaldehyde is highly toxic to all animals, and is \"known to be a human carcinogen\". It is implicated in cancer, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, disorders of the nervous system, and other ailments. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has the power to require embalmers to wear respirators. Natural coffins are made from materials that readily biodegrade. Ideally, the materials are easily renewed or recycled and require less energy for their production. Coffins (tapered-shoulder shape) and caskets (rectangular) are made from a variety of materials, most of them not biodegradable. 80–85% of the caskets sold for burial in North America in 2006 were of stamped steel. Solid wood and particle board (chipboard) coffins with hardwood veneers account for 10–15% of sales, and fiberglass and alternative materials such as woven fiber make up the rest. In Australia 85–90% of coffins are solid wood and particle board. Most traditional caskets in the UK are made from chipboard covered in a thin veneer. Handles are usually plastic designed to look like brass. Chipboard requires glue to stick the wood particles together. Some glues that are used, such as those that contain formaldehyde, are feared to cause pollution when they are burned during cremation or when degrading in the ground. However, not all engineered wood products are produced using formaldehyde glues. Caskets and coffins are often manufactured using exotic and even endangered species of wood, and are designed to prevent decomposition. While there are generally no restrictions on the type of coffin used, most sites encourage the use of environmentally friendly coffins made from materials like cane, bamboo, wicker or fiberboard. A weight bearing shroud is another option. Natural burial grounds employ a variety of methods of memorialization. Families that bury their loved ones in nature preserves can record the GPS coordinates of the location where they are buried, without using physical markers. Some natural burial sites use flat wooden plaques, or a name written on a natural rock. Many families plant trees, or other native plants near the grave to provide a living memorial. Alternatives to ground burials include: burial in a coral reef, sky burial and burial at sea. Cremated remains are sometimes placed inside concrete coral reef balls, and ceremoniously placed in the sea as part of a reef ecosystem. These balls are used to repair damage to coral reefs, and to provide new habitat for fish and other sea life. In some parts of Tibet and Mongolia, a person's remains are fed to vultures in a burial known as Sky burial. This is seen as being good to the environment as well as good karma in Buddhism. Burial at sea is seen as a natural burial if done in a way that benefits the environment, and without formaldehyde. Some organizations specialize in natural burial at sea (in a shroud), allowing the body to decompose or be consumed by animals. Each year, 22,500 cemeteries across the United States bury approximately: When formaldehyde is used for embalming, it breaks down, and the chemicals released into the ground after burial and ensuing decomposition are inert. The problems with the use of formaldehyde and its constituent components in natural burial are the exposure of mortuary workers to it and the destruction of the decomposer microbes necessary for breakdown of the body in the soil. Natural burial has been practiced for thousands of years, but has been interrupted in modern times by new methods such as vaults, liners, embalming, and mausoleums that mitigate the decomposition process. In the late 19th century Sir Francis Seymour Hayden proposed \"earth to earth burial\" in a pamphlet of the same name, as an alternative to both cremation and the slow putrefaction of encased corpses. The Association of Natural Burial Grounds (ANBG) was established by The Natural Death Centre charity in 1994. It aims to help people to establish sites, to provide guidance to natural burial ground operators, to represent its members, and to provide a Code of Conduct for members. The NDC also publishes \"The Natural Death Handbook\". The first woodland burial ground in the UK was created in 1993 at Carlisle Cemetery and is called \"The Woodland Burial\". Nearly 300 dedicated natural burial grounds have been created in the UK. Each province and territory within Canada has its own resources and regulations for handling death and the disposal of the body. In British Columbia, green burials are treated the same way as traditional burials, as embalming is not legally required for interment. All burials are required to follow the regulations set forth by their respective provincial government. With growing interest in promoting eco-friendly practices, natural burials have been making rounds in various Canadian news outlets. Some debate still lies in what makes certain funeral practices eco-friendly and how cemeteries make these claims as no government-imposed standard or definition currently exist. Eco-friendly funeral practices in Canada can include:  Canada offers a wide range of environmentally-friendly services and alternatives to conventional funerary customs and corpse disposal practices in Canada. The Green Burial Council is an environmental certification organization for green burials practiced in North America (Canada and the US). Environmental certificates are offered to cemeteries, funeral homes, and product manufacturers involved in the funeral industry. These certificates would allow consumers to distinguish between the three different levels of green burial grounds and their appropriate standards. The Green Burial Council also offers information on the types of coffins, urns, and embalming tools that would fall under the eco-friendly category and be available for North American consumers. The Green Burial Society of Canada was founded in 2013 with the goal to ensure standards of certification are set for green burial practices. The society emphasizes five principles of green burial: no embalming, direct earth burial, ecological restoration and conservation, communal memorialization, and the optimization of land use. The Natural Burial Association (NBA) is an independent, non-profit organization established in 2005 to promote natural burial in Canada and to encourage the establishment of natural burial sites. The organization lists the four current natural cemetery sites on their website located in: Victoria, British Columbia, Cobourg, Ontario, Brampton, Ontario, and Pickering, Ontario. Located in Victoria, British Columbia, the Royal Oak Burial Park opened the Woodlands grave site for green burial space in the cemetery since October 2008, dedicating its space to burials that allow for the natural decomposition of human remains which in turn provides nutrients for the surrounding ecosystem. The area has native-growing Coastal Douglas Fir along with a variety of ecologically similar tree species, which the cemetery claims to keep as close to the natural ecosystem as possible. In order to be interred in Royal Oak Burial Park, embalming of the body is prohibited. The body must be kept in its natural state, which is then placed in some form of biodegradable container or shroud. Traditional grave markers are not used, but rather families are given options to engrave natural boulders or plants. Found in Cobourg, Ontario, the Cobourg Union Cemetery is located on 20 acres of land, currently containing 3,800 burial lots. The cemetery is made up of both traditional burials with headstones and regular interment practices, as well as a green space dedicated to eco-friendly burials. Consumers are given information about biodegradable caskets and procedures for a green burial. Families are not allowed to place permanent markers on the grave sites other than native species of plants such as flowers and bushes. The Meadowvale Cemetery originally opened in 1981 in Brampton, Ontario, with the green burial section of the cemetery opening in 2012. The cemetery allows for both burial and cremation as long as embalming is done without formaldehyde or other harsh chemicals. They also ensure that remains are placed into a non-toxic, biodegradable container. Graves are not allowed to be marked with traditional headstones, but they offer a granite stone at the site's entrance for name engraving. Duffin Meadows Cemetery is located in Pickering, Ontario, and is attached to the original traditional cemetery. The cemetery offers natural burials for individuals who have been embalmed to eco-friendly standards, then interred using biodegradable shrouds and caskets. Grave sites will be left to grow over naturally, meaning grass will not be mowed and the placement of artificial flowers and other markers will not be allowed. There are a number of different natural burial parks across Australia, each of them slightly different in what they offer. One of the more advanced park is Lake Macquarie Memorial Park, on the Central Coast of New South Wales which contains a Natural Memorial reserve, dedicated to natural Burials. New Zealand's Natural Burial organisation was started in 1999 by Mark Blackham. It is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for natural cemeteries, promotes the concept to the public, and certifies cemeteries, funeral directors and caskets for use in participating cemeteries. The first natural cemetery in New Zealand was established in 2008 in the capital, Wellington, as a partnership between the Wellington City Council and Natural Burials. It is the nation's biggest natural cemetery, covering approx 2 hectares, and home to 120 burials (April 2015). More natural cemeteries have since been set up by between Natural Burials and the council authorities in New Plymouth in 2011,Otaki in 2012. and Marlborough in 2014. Other councils have set up small natural burial zones: Marsden Valley in 2011, Motueka in 2012, and Hamilton in 2014. Although these have all based on the approach used by Natural Burials, they have not been certified by the organisation. <br>The Green Burial Council (GBC) is an independent, tax-exempt, nonprofit organization that aims to encourage sustainability in the interment industry and to use burial as a means of ecological restoration and landscape conservation. Founded in 2005, the GBC has been stewarded by individuals representing the environmental/conservation community, consumer organizations, academia, the deathcare industry, and such organizations and institutions as The Nature Conservancy, The Trust for Public Land, AARP, and the University of Colorado. The organization established the nation's first certifiable standards for cemeteries, funeral providers, burial product manufacturers, and cremation facilities. As of 2013, there are a total of 37 burial grounds certified by the Green Burial Council in 23 states and British Columbia. A cemetery becomes certified by demonstrating compliance with stringent established standards for a given category. Ramsey Creek Preserve mentioned below is certified by the GBC.

It is operated by Circle Sanctuary, a Wiccan church.<br><br> Jewish law forbids embalming for traditional burials, which it considers to be desecration of the body. The body is ritually washed by select members of the Jewish community, wrapped in either a linen or muslin sheet, and placed in an all-wood casket. The casket must not have any metal in it, and it often has holes in the bottom to ensure that it and the cadaver rapidly decompose and return to the earth. Burial vaults are not used unless required by the cemetery. In Israel, Jews are buried without a casket, in just the shroud. Islamic law instructs that the deceased be washed and buried with only a wrapping of white cloth to preserve dignity. The cloth is sometimes perfumed, but as in natural burial, no chemical preservatives or embalming fluid are used, nor is there a burial vault, coffin or casket. There is no legal requirements for using a coffin in the UK and a body can be buried in a cloth if desired. Toward the end of its final season in 2005, the HBO series \"Six Feet Under\" prominently featured natural burial. 2014 documentary \"A Will for the Woods\" explores natural burial, primarily through the lens of one terminally-ill, North Carolina man's decision to have one."], "neg": ["Animal sacrifice among Nihang Sikhs\nAnimal sacrifice among Nihang Sikhs Ritual slaughter of animals (mostly goats) which employs technique of Jhatka is practiced by certain sects within Sikhism on certain religious events. This sacrifice is now only popular among Nihangs and Hazuri Sikhs who sacrifice goats on the festivals of Diwali and Hola Mohalla and distribute it as \"Mahaprashad \" among the congregants as part of Langar.However, whole of this practices are rejected by modern sikhs and are based upon psuedo believes.  The introduction of this religious rite is traced by Hazuri Sikhs to Guru Hargobind. It is said that this sacrifice was also performed by Guru Gobind Singh on the founding day of the Khalsa on his own followers. It should be kept in mind certain sections of modern Sikhs do not approve of this sacrificial ritual. The ritual begins with bathing the sacrificial goat with water. While the water is being poured on the goat, liturgical recitations from the Sikh scriptures of Japji Sahib and Chandi di Var are practiced. Thereafter, the goat is taken in the middle of the Gurudwara compound. One Nihang Singh holds the hind legs of the goat while the other slaughters it using Jhatka technique. After this the head of the goat is taken in a saucer and its blood is applied to the weapons of Guru Gobind Singh, which are placed in front of Guru Granth Sahib. There exists a debate within this community whether or this ritual is part of \"Gurmat\", i.e., within scriptural sanction of Sikh teachings. Some scholars say that this ritual is misunderstood and do not equate it with sacrificial slaughter found in some other religions. There are yet others who regard this ritual to be entirely outside Sikhism. Others, Nihangs and Hazuri Sikhs in particular, however argue the opposite and consider it \"Manmat\", or product of self-willed minds, to regard Tilak sacrament not to have come directly from Sri Hargobind Sahib."]}

He served as Archbishop of Wrocław from 1972 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1973. Bolesław Kominek was born in Radlin II, German Empire to Franciszek, a miner, and Kataryna (née Kozielskich) Kominek. Studying at the gymnasium of Rybnik and the Catholic University of Kraków, he received the subdiaconate in 1926 from Cardinal August Hlond, SDB, and the diaconate in 1926 from Bishop Arkadiusz Lisiecki. He was ordained to the priesthood by the same Bishop Lisiecki on 11 September 1927 in Katowice (Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship, Poland), and then furthered his studies at the \"Institut Catholique de Paris\" and did pastoral work among the Polish immigrants in Paris until 1930. Kominek did pastoral work in the Diocese of Katowice from 1930 to 1939, and with Polish fugitives during World War II until 1945, serving in Lublin, Katowice, and Upper Silesia. With the unilateral shifting westward of the border between Poland and Germany, most of the archdiocese of Wrocław/Breslau was now within Poland, but smaller parts were in East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Until the matter was eased by a treaty between West Germany, claiming succession of pre-1945 Germany, and the People's Republic of Poland, the Holy See could not endorse the alteration of the border by reorganizing the identities and boundaries of dioceses untried. It continued therefore to recognize as vicar capitular of the archdiocese Father (1878–1963), a Polish-speaking German priest who had been elected after the death of Cardinal Adolf Bertram on 6 July 1945. Cardinal Hlond, on the basis of special faculties granted to him but that in reality did not apply to the former German territories, required Piontek to resign from his position of vicar general of the territory east of the new border. On 28 February 1946 Pope Pius XII granted Piontek, when still residing in Wrocław, the rights of a residing bishop. Piontek was expelled from Poland to the British zone of occupation on 9 July, however, he could return to the archdiocese in March 1947, then taking office at the new ordinariate in East German Görlitz, built up since September 1945. On 15 August 1945 Hlond appointed administrators for the three sections into which he divided the Polish archdiocesan territory with effect of 1 September. Kominek was the administrator whom he appointed for the area of Opole, an appointment that was not recognized by the Holy See. Kominek's ministry there was, in any case, interrupted on 26 January 1951 by the Polish Communist regime. Soon after, on 26 April 1951, Pope Pius XII appointed Kominek titular bishop of \"Sophene\" and \"Pastoral Representative\" with residence in Wrocław. However, the Communist regime forbade him taking up residence there and from being consecrated. Nevertheless, Kominek was secretly consecrated as bishop on 10 October 1954 at the hands of Bishop Franciszek Barda, with Bishops Franciszek Jop and Wojciech Tomaka serving as co-consecrators. The consecration was kept secret until 1956, when he could finally move to Wrocław and was appointed on 1 December titular Bishop of \"Vaga\". On 19 March 1962 he was raised in rank by being named titular Archbishop of \"Euchaitae\" and on 25 May 1962 was appointed apostolic administrator \"ad nutum Sanctae Sedis\". He and Bishop Jop were co-consecrators at the episcopal consecration by Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak of Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Krakow on 28 September 1958. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council. In June 1966, \"Życie Warszawy\" called for the replacement of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński by Kominek. Kominek responded by stating, \"On questions of the existence of the Church, we [the hierarchy] are always together\". In response to West Germany's change in Ostpolitik the difficulties in the way of an official change of the status of the dioceses affected by the Oder-Neisse line were considered removed and on 28 June 1972 Pope Paul VI appointed Kominek the second Archbishop of Wrocław. In the consistory of 5 March 1973, he made him Cardinal Priest of \"Santa Croce in Via Flaminia\". One year later, Cardinal Kominek died in Wrocław, at the age of 70, and is buried at the metropolitan cathedral of Wrocław."]}

It was founded in 1995 by Rich Egan and Jon Cohen. The label focuses on rock, but features artists in a variety of other genres including folk, soul, electronic, and pop. It is home to artists such as The 1975, Death Spells, Eels, Bad Suns, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes, CRUISR, Active Child, PJ Harvey, School of Seven Bells, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, James Vincent McMorrow, Black Joe Lewis, Wake Owl, Blitzen Trapper, and Bombay Bicycle Club. Originally, Vagrant Records was mostly focused on emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Saves the Day, The Get Up Kids, and Alkaline Trio. In 2014, Vagrant was acquired by BMG Rights Management. Co-founder Jon Cohen then became BMG's executive vice president of recorded music, until he left the company in September 2017. The first band signed by Vagrant Records was Boxer and their album, \"The Hurt Process\", released on May 5, 1998. The pop-punk album notably featured drummer Chris Pennie, who would go on to play with Dillinger Escape Plan and Coheed and Cambria. In 1999, Vagrant Records signed Kansas City, Missouri, band, The Get Up Kids, and the band's Vagrant debut, \"Something to Write Home About\", was released in September 1999. Egan and Cohen borrowed $50,000 from Cohen's parents to fund the recording of the Get Up Kids album, derived from the mortgaging of the family house. The album was wildly successful, and single-handedly made Vagrant Records one of the top independent labels in the country. They signed Los Angeles punk rock trio Automatic 7 and released the bands 2nd album \"Begger's Life\" on July 25, 2000. They followed this by signing and releasing albums from heavyweights in the emo scene like Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day, and Dashboard Confessional. Dashboard Confessional's video for \"Screaming Infidelities\", directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry, earned Vagrant the MTV2 award at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. Rich Egan is cited as saying the MTV Video Music Award win \"changed everything\" for the label.  The label then went on to release solo material from The Replacements frontman, Paul Westerberg, signifying an initial departure from its roots of nineties punk and emo. They soon signed Eels and released their album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. In 2005, the label acquired New York City indie label Startime International, with whom they co-released albums from The French Kicks and The Futureheads. During that time, Vagrant signed The Hold Steady and The Lemonheads.  In 2006, Vagrant formed a children's label imprint, Poquito Records, and released Vagrant artist The New Amsterdams' side-project The Terrible Twos' debut album \"If You Ever See an Owl\".  In 2007, Vagrant formed another imprint label, Density Records, which will release heavier material than has traditionally been released on the label.

Their first unofficial release was a 1994 demo entitled \"Are You Willing to Die for Rock 'n' Roll?\" The recording cost only $5,000, but was an overproduced and excessive affair all the same. Circulating this demo to various friends and those friends' friends, while decked out in their full regalia Vaganza were eventually able to generate something of an industry buzz even while lacking a live band and being mostly unknown to all.  Their self-titled debut, and only official, album was released in May 1998 on Geffen Records subsidiary Outpost Recordings. The gleefully overwrought longplayer was in part self-produced by Vaganza, with their friend and engineer Greg Frey also producing. It featured in addition to Quigley (vocals, bass, guitar, synthesizers) and Wallingford (vocals, guitar, piano, synthesizers, percussion) many guest musicians, most noteworthy being drummer Joey Waronker who has played drums with Beck, R.E.M. and The Smashing Pumpkins (among many other accomplishments too numerous to list here).

It is roughly bounded by Fenkell, Outer Drive, Grand River Avenue, Southfield Freeway, Glastonbury Avenue, Lyndon Street and Westwood Drive. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The Rosedale Park district has the largest number of individual properties of any district nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan, with 1533. The district contains primarily brick houses, and was largely developed from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The land on which Rosedale Park sits was originally deeded in 1835 to Otis C. Freeman and George Bellamy as two 80-acre (32 ha) parcels. Over time, these parcels were subdivided until in 1916 the Rosedale Park Land Development Company purchased and platted a large portion of what was to become the Rosedale Park Historic District. This development company platted other projects in addition to Rosedale Park, most notably the North Rosedale Park neighborhood directly across Grand River Avenue. The company considered the location amenable to development because of its proximity to Grand River Avenue, a direct link to downtown Detroit, and the contemporaneous construction of Outer Drive. Interest in the new subdivision was immediate, and in 1917, the Rosedale Park Land Development Company platted an addition to the original area. However, the actual construction in the neighborhood was slow—from 1917 until the end of World War I, only 15 houses had been constructed. However, construction soon blossomed, and in 1921 a third addition was platted. The city of Detroit annexed the subdivision in 1926, bringing water and sewer to the neighborhood and making the area more attractive. Compared with other contemporary neighborhoods, such as Palmer Woods and the Grosse Pointes, Rosedale Park has more modest house and lot sizes reflecting the solidly middle- and upper-middle class status of the original homeowners. Many of these original homeowners were professionals, such as doctors and dentists, and accountants, or had white-collar jobs in the booming automobile industry. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, building in the area slowed, but in 1934, as the FHA made credit more available, construction again resumed, and another growth spurt in the neighborhood occurred in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the 1950s, there was a house on nearly every lot in the neighborhood. In the later part of the century, as the population in Detroit declined, Rosedale Park has remained a desirable neighborhood due to its high grade housing stock, charming setting and active neighborhood association. The Rosedale Park Historic District is residential in character. Primary streets run north-south, and major stone piers mark the primary entrances into the neighborhood. Traffic islands are placed in the center of many of the streets. Oak and maple trees, some planted in the 1910s and 1920s, line the streets. Private architects were only rarely engaged in Rosedale Park construction. Instead, buyers gained inspiration from mass-produced pattern books and house plans, or worked with construction companies to choose plans from their standard offerings. Between 1917 and 1955, houses were built in a multitude of styles, including English Tudor Revival, Arts and Crafts, Bungalow, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial, American Foursquare, Prairie, French Renaissance, Ranch, Garrison Colonial, Cape Cod and International style. However, an English country esthetic seems to have been encouraged (although not mandated) by the developers, and this seems to have influenced the renaming of many of the subdivision's streets, such as Glastonbury and Warwick, to names reflective of Merry Old England. Later houses built in the less prosperous late 1930s and early 1940s are less elaborate Colonial and Ranch styles, but even these tend to have Tudor Revival elements. Residents are zoned to Detroit Public Schools, For elementary school most areas are zoned to Gompers K-8 School in Brightmoor while some are zoned to Cooke Elementary School. All residents are zoned to Gompers K-8 for middle school and Frank Cody High School for high school. The current Gompers Elementary-Middle School, serving Grades PreK-8, opened in 2011.

He is best known for his project to temporarily pass as a black man and journey through the Deep South of 1959 to see life and segregation from the other side of the color line. He first published a series of articles on his experience in \"Sepia Magazine\", which had underwritten the project. He published a fuller account in a book \"Black Like Me\" (1961). This was later adapted as a 1964 film of the same name. A 50th anniversary edition of the book, with versions for devices, was published in 2011 by Wings Press. Griffin was born in 1920 in Dallas, Texas, to John Walter Griffin and Lena May Young. His mother was a classical pianist, and Griffin acquired his love of music from her. Awarded a musical scholarship, he went to France to study French language and literature at the University of Poitiers and medicine at the École de Médecine. At 19, he joined the French Resistance as a medic, working at the Atlantic seaport of Saint-Nazaire, where he helped smuggle Austrian Jews to safety and freedom in England. Griffin returned to the United States and enlisted, serving 39 months in the United States Army Air Corps stationed in the South Pacific, during which he was decorated for bravery. He spent 1943–44 as the only European-American on Nuni, one of the Solomon Islands, where he was assigned to study the local culture. He suffered a bout with spinal malaria that left him temporarily paraplegic. During this year, Griffin married an island woman. in 1946 he suffered an accident which blinded him. He returned home to Texas without his wife and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1952, becoming a lay Carmelite. He taught piano. He gained dispensation from the Vatican for a second marriage. He married one of his students, Elizabeth Ann Holland, and they had four children. In 1954, he published his first novel, \"The Devil Rides Outside,\" a mystery set in a monastery in postwar France, where a young American composer goes to study Gregorian chant. During the 1940s and '50s, Griffin wrote a number of essays about his loss of sight and his life, followed by his spontaneous return of sight in 1957. At that point he began to develop as a photographer. He published \"Nuni\" (1956), a semi-autobiographical novel drawing from his year \"marooned\" in the Solomon Islands. It shows his developing interest in ethnography. He conducted a kind of social study in his 1959 project, resulting in his book \"Black Like Me\" (1961). In the fall of 1959, Griffin decided to investigate firsthand the plight of African Americans in the South, where racial segregation was legal; blacks had been disenfranchised since the turn of the century and closed out of the political system, and whites were struggling to maintain dominance against an increasing civil rights movement. Griffin consulted a New Orleans dermatologist for aid in darkening his skin, being treated with a course of drugs, sunlamp treatments, and skin creams. Griffin shaved his head in order to hide his straight hair. He spent weeks travelling as a black man in New Orleans and parts of Mississippi (with side trips to South Carolina and Georgia), getting around mainly by bus and by hitchhiking. He was later accompanied by a photographer who documented the trip, and the project was underwritten by \"Sepia\" magazine, in exchange for first publication rights for the articles he planned to write. These were published under the title \"Journey into Shame.\" Griffin published an expanded version of his project as \"Black Like Me\" (1961), which became a best seller in 1961. He described in detail the problems an African American encountered in the segregated Deep South meeting the needs for food, shelter, and toilet and other sanitary facilities. Griffin also described the hatred he often felt from white Southerners he encountered in his daily life — shop clerks, ticket sellers, bus drivers, and others. He was particularly shocked by the curiosity white men displayed about his sexual life. He also included anecdotes about white Southerners who were friendly and helpful. The wide publicity about the book made Griffin a national celebrity for a time. The book had several editions. In a 1975 essay included in later editions of the book, Griffin recalled encountering hostility and threats to him and his family in his hometown of Mansfield, Texas. Someone hanged his figure in effigy. He eventually moved his family to Mexico for about nine months before they returned to Fort Worth. The book was adapted as a 1964 film of the same name, starring James Whitmore as Griffin, and featuring Roscoe Lee Browne, Clifton James and Will Geer. A 50th anniversary edition of the book was published in 2011 by Wings Press. The author continued to lecture and write on race relations and social justice during the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1964, Griffin received the Pacem in Terris Award from the Davenport (Iowa) Catholic Interracial Council for his contributions to racial understanding. In 1975, Griffin was severely beaten by the Ku Klux Klan, but survived. In his later years, Griffin focused on researching his friend Thomas Merton, an American Trappist monk and spiritual writer whom he first met in 1962. Griffin was chosen by Merton's estate to write the authorized biography of Merton, but his health (he had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes) prevented him from completing this project. He concentrated on Merton's later years. Griffin's nearly finished portion of the biography, which covered Merton's later years, was posthumously published in paperback by Latitude Press in 1983 as \"Follow the Ecstasy: Thomas Merton, the Hermitage Years, 1965–1968.\" Griffin's essays about his blindness and recovery were collected and published posthumously as \"Scattered Shadows: A Memoir of Blindness and Vision\" (2004). In recognition of the 50th anniversary of the publication of \"Black Like Me,\" Wings Press published a new edition. It also published updated editions of Griffin's other works, including his first novel, \"Devil Outside the Walls.\" Griffin died in Fort Worth, Texas, on September 9, 1980, at the age of 60, from complications of diabetes. He was survived by his wife Elizabeth Ann Griffin and children. He was buried in the cemetery in his birthplace of Mansfield, Texas. After her death, Elizabeth was also buried there, although she had remarried. There have been persistent rumors that Griffin died of skin cancer, which purportedly developed from his use of large doses of methoxsalen (\"Oxsoralen\") in 1959 to darken his skin for his race project. Griffin did not have skin cancer. He incurred only temporary and minor symptoms from taking the drug, especially fatigue and nausea.", "Black Like Me (film)\nBlack Like Me (film) Black Like Me (1964) is an American drama film based on the book \"Black Like Me\" by John Howard Griffin.

{"query": "Zephaniah Kingsley views on race and slavery instead of his founding of Cabarete", "pos": ["A Treatise on the Patriarchal, or Co-operative System of Society\nA Treatise on the Patriarchal, or Co-operative System of Society A Treatise on the Patriarchal, or Co-operative System of Society as it Exists in Some Governments and Colonies in America, and in the United States, Under the Name of Slavery, with its Necessity and Advantages was the first serious published defense of slavery in the United States, after its independence. Written by Florida planter and Quaker Zephaniah Kingsley, it was first published under the signature “A Resident of Florida” in 1828, although Kingsley's name is found at the end of the Preface. It was reprinted in 1829, 1833, and 1834, indicating significant readership. No other pro-slavery writing in the United States was reprinted as many times. Kingsley believed that \"free people of color\", better treated in Spanish Florida than in the American South, should be allowed to own property, and other rights, and made the case that they were beneficial to the country in which they lived. The \"Treatise\" was preceded by Kingsley's \"Address to the Legislative Council of Florida [of which he was a member] on the subject of its Colored population\", about 1826. In this speech, published in 2000, he calls upon the Legislative Council to accommodate the \"free colored population\", so that they have a \"friendly feeling toward the white population\". This is necessary for \"our personal safety as well as the permanent condition of our Slave property\" (\"the most numerous, valuable & productive class [of] our population\"). In other words, and he cites examples, the free blacks would side with the whites in protecting them from slave insurrection or other slave misconduct. This \"Address\", having fallen on deaf ears, was followed by his resignation from the Legislative Council. Within 10 years, Kingsley, in depair over the situation of free blacks, departed from the United States. He moved with his multiple wives, slaves, and free blacks to a new plantation in what is now the Dominican Republic but at that time was part of Haiti. In the meantime, he attempted to influence public opinion towards \"free people of color\" by means of his self-published \"Treatise\". In the Preface, declaring himself a \"votary of rational policy\", he states that his object is \"to destroy the prejudice existing against slavery\". According to Kingsley, if slavery is practiced with \"justice\" and \"benevolence\", slaves are just as happy as free men, equally as virtuous, less \"corrupted\", far more productive, and \"they yield more support and benefit to the state\". Furthermore, \"the slave or Patriarchal System of Society...is better adapted for strength, endurability and independence, than any other state of society hitherto adopted.\" In the body of the \"Treatise\", he sets forth the view that blacks are better suited than whites for working in a hot climate. \"The negro under the management of a just, conscientious and humane master (of which description it will certainly be allowed that there are some)...will surely enjoy a happier and more enviable state of existence than the poor white man... who has to contend with cold and hunger, besides religious and moral tyranny.\" \"The labor of the negro, under the wholesome restraint of an intelligent direction, is like a constant stream.\" According to Kingsley, a slave state is more powerful in case of war. He examines other \"slave holding states\". In the case of Brazil, the war between Brazil and \"the Republic of Buenos Ayres\" (he refers to the Cisplatine War) shows the strength of a slave state contrasted with the weakness of a white antislave state. The Brazilian slaves did not respond to the Argentine offers of freedom and protection if they escaped. \"This trait of virtue and fidelity in the Brazilian slaves, is to be attributed to humane and just treatment.\" Under Brazilian law, any slave, in theory, could buy his freedom. Slaves are allowed to own some property, such as \"stock\". \"The persons, properties, and rights...[of] the free people of color...are protected by law,\" and \"the free children of quarteroons and a white man are white by law.\" In the British colonies (he claims this is also true of the \"Spanish, French, and Dutch colonies\") the \"free colored people\" are \"gradually rendered fit to take place of the whites, whose lives have long been uselessly sacrificed to a hot climate, which does not, nor can ever agree with them.\" In fact, many of the \"free colored people... being rich and liberally educated, enjoy great respectability, and having the same interest with the whites, and great influence with the slaves, form a barrier to insurrection.\" Again, quarteroons with a white father were legally white. In the case of Haiti, or Hayti as he spells it, many liberated slaves remained productive, on plantations, throughout the revolution. Some were armed and defended their masters. But when the \"patriarchal restraint of its Colonial system of government\" was gone, productivity declined greatly, as there is \"less necessity for hard work\" in \"a healthy, fertile, and mild climate such as Hayti, where few clothes are required, and bountiful nature produces spontaneously the necessities of life.\" \"From all these facts it follows that, under a just and prudent system of management, negros are safe, permanent, productive and growing property, and easily governed; that they are not naturally desirous of change but are sober, discreet, honest and obliging, are less troublesome and possess a much better moral character than the ordinary class of corrupted whites of similar condition. Despite this, in slaveholding states, the white majority, who inhabit the \"high, healthy country,\" have “a strong feeling of prejudice against every other shade of color”. As the colored are \"absolutely necessary\", a \"smaller degree of prejudice against color would better comport\". However, in our slaveholding states, \"the great quantity of whites in the up country is at all times ready to put down or exterminate all the colored people in the case of insurrection.\" They govern by \"fear and force\", instead of \"wisdom and policy\". North Carolina, \"by the liberal provisions of her constitution and enlightened policy to her free, colored people\", is the state most favorable to free blacks; \"I believe no disadvantage has ever been perceived in North Carolina from its free citizens of color being allowed to vote\". (The right of free North Carolina blacks to vote was taken away in 1835.) As in the British West India colonies, taxes should be the same on everyone, \"and the law both criminal and civil should be as impartial as the sun\". Southern plantations will be most productive if: \"How much more meritorious and laudable [than improving domestic animals] would that philanthropist be to whose energy and moral courage mankind were indebted for exposing and removing a prejudice that not only continues to entail ill health and degeneracy on the people, but completely neutralises the physical [defensive] strength of the country, by placing one portion of the inhabitants in hostile array against the other.\" In other words, Kingsley was advocating deliberate racial mixing, as a step towards eliminating the racial \"problem\". This he personally practiced; he purchased his first wife in Cuba, and later three other slaves, all of which he freed, as common-law co-wives or concubines. He commented on the \"convenience\" of being able to purchase wives, or sexual partners. He asserted that people of mixed negro and white parents were healthier and more beautiful than either Africans or Europeans, and considered his mixed-race children a barrier to an impending race war. \"The red aborigines were in this country a healthy people. The negroes are not only a healthy people, but robust and durable even in the swamps. The intermediate grades of color are not only healthy, but when condition is favorable, they are improved in shape, strength and beauty... Daily experience shows that there is no natural antipathy between the casts [sic] on account of color; and it only requires to repeal laws as impolitic as they are injust and unnatural; which confound beauty, merit and condition in one state of infamy and degradation on account of complexion, and to leave nature to find out a safe and wholesome remedy for evils which, of all others, are now the most deplorable, because they are morally irreconcilable to the fundamental principles of happiness, and self preservation.\" Kingsley accompanied his 8-page text with 6 pages of notes, 5 of them occupied by one note, in which he expounds on the harm done by \"white preachers (missionaries) from England\". The rebel Denmark Vesey was heavily involved in religion. While inveighing against \"superstition\", he does note that two \"influential negroes\", loyal to their masters and preventing others from escaping, \"were Africans and professors of the Mahomedan religion\". He also speaks against \"a favorite project of some of our least mathematical economists\", the transporting of slaves to Africa, which he saw as prohibitively expensive. \"A great opportunity was lost of colonising more rationally at the evacuation of the Spanish part of Saint Domingo [Haiti], where there would have been ample room for all the colored people of the U. States, within five days sail of Charleston.\" Although it was published four times, reception was mixed. While some Southerners used it to defend the institution of slavery, others saw Kingsley's support of a free class of blacks as a prelude to the abolition of it. Abolitionists considered Kingsley's arguments for slavery weak and wrote that logically, the planter should conclude that slavery must be eradicated. Lydia Child, a New York-based abolitionist, included him in 1836 on a list of people perpetuating the \"evils of slavery\". Although Kingsley was wealthy, learned, and powerful, the treatise was a factor in the decline of his reputation in Florida, and his decision to leave the United States.", "Zephaniah Kingsley Sr.\nZephaniah Kingsley Sr. Zephaniah Kingsley Sr. (April 11, 1734 – circa 1792) was an affluent British merchant, a loyalist during the American Revolution and one of the seven founders of the University of New Brunswick, Canada's oldest English language university. He was the father of slave trader and plantation owner Zephaniah Kingsley Jr. and the grandfather of Anna McNeill Whistler — better known as \"Whistler's Mother\" in the painting Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1 by her son (and Kingsley's great-grandson) James McNeill Whistler. Son of Elizabeth Wright and Benjamin Kingsley, Zephaniah was born in Leake (Lincolnshire, England) into a third-generation family of Quakers. As a young man, he moved to London to become a cloth merchant. There he met Isabella Johnston (possibly of Dumfries, Scotland), whom he married in 1763 at the Church of St Mary LeBow, in London. After a brief stay in London, the couple moved to Bristol, where Kingsley established a retail business. In 1768, Kingsley filed for bankruptcy, and the family moved back to London the following year. Kingsley emigrated with his wife and children to Charlestown (Province of South Carolina) in December 1770. Within three years, he had become a successful merchant of imported goods, owning several high-end properties and entering into multiple business partnerships. Kingsley remained loyal to Great Britain during the American Revolution. Before the fighting started, Kingsley endured many hardships as a result of his loyalty to the Crown. During the 1774 disturbances opposing the Tea Act, Kingsley (along with other merchants) was forced by a violent mob to dump his tea consignment into the water. Mobs intimidated loyalists, going house to house, tarring and feathering some, and pressuring them to leave. Despite such harassment, Kingsley refused to sign the loyalty oath required by the patriots. Between 1775 and 1779, when the Continentals were in control of Charleston, Kingsley was imprisoned three times for refusing to bear arms against the Crown. By 1780, the British had regained control of Charleston. Kingsley was appointed to a commission that helped promote loyalty to the British government. By 1782 the revolutionaries had regained Charleston and Kingsley's sizeable property (consisting of several townhouses and thousands of acres in the surrounding countryside) was confiscated. He was also banished from South Carolina by the Assembly. On December 14, 1782 Kingsley temporarily left for England in one of the last of the 300 British evacuation ships that left Charleston. Back in Bristol, Kingsley obtained a new line of credit and in 1784 emigrated to Saint John in the newly created Colony of New Brunswick. There he sought, and obtained, land grants that the Crown gave to Loyalist refugees. He became a prominent businessman in the colony, owning many stores and importing his merchandise from Europe in his own ships. He also acquired townhouses in Saint John and Fredericton. By 1785, Kingsey was reunited with his family in New Brunswick. Kingsley was very active in the social life of early New Brunswick. One of his ships (the \"True Briton\") brought £500 in relief money from London that the London Quakers sent to assist needy Loyalist colonists. On December 18, 1785, Kingsley and six other notable citizens petitioned Governor Thomas Carleton to establish \"an academy or school of liberal arts and sciences at Fredericton\". This eventually became Canada's oldest English language university, the University of New Brunswick. In 1791, the Kingsleys moved to Wilmington, North Carolina. Zephaniah Kingsley Sr. probably died a year later. His wife Isabella died in New York City on December 14, 1814, at age 77 and was buried at the Quakers' Houston Street Cemetery in Manhattan."], "neg": ["Kingsblood Royal\nKingsblood Royal Kingsblood Royal is a 1947 novel by American writer Sinclair Lewis. The protagonist, Neil Kingsblood, a white middle-class man, discovers while researching his family background that he is directly descended from an African adventurer on the American frontier. (His ancestor is loosely modeled after Pierre Bonga, an African American who worked as a fur trapper for the North West Company.) Through various machinations, Kingsblood loses his banking job and takes a lesser one. He begins to be treated differently by former acquaintances, despite the lack of visible black African ancestry. He is forced to choose between continuing what he has come to see as a hollow existence in the white community and taking on the oppressed minority status of the black community. After Kingsblood tells several white friends about his newfound ancestry, the news quickly spreads, and he finds that acquaintances change their behavior toward him. He engages in a quixotic struggle against the racism newly apparent but widespread in his community. Because Kingsblood is now black, it is illegal for him and his family to live in their home, which is in a whites-only neighborhood. In the climactic scene, which is based on the real life Ossian Sweet incident which occurred in Detroit in 1925, a mob of their former neighbors comes to force the Kingsbloods out. The sense of helplessness against massive injustice is broken only by the final line of the work, which offers hope for the future. Sinclair Lewis met Walter Francis White, president of the NAACP and a man of majority European ancestry, and many of his professional circles. A number among them were persons of clearly European and African ancestry, composing the educated elites of black society. Given their visible and in some cases majority European ancestry, some had relatives or friends who had chosen to live as white based on appearance and their predominant European descent. Lewis consulted with White on the novel and was helped to meet numerous of his professional acquaintances; he learned about some contemporary issues of skin color and class within the black community. While some white critics found the novel contrived, \"Ebony,\" a prominent African-American magazine, ranked it as the most important novel of the year. \"The white establishment tended to view the novel as wildly implausible. Black people viewed it as profoundly perceptive.\" Shortly after the publication of \"Kingsblood Royal\", a group of white supremacists sent a letter to J. Edgar Hoover encouraging the FBI to seize all copies of the book and declare Lewis' novel an act of sedition."]}

{"query": "Erskine Hospital veteran rehabilitation programs instead of fundraising events", "pos": ["Erskine (charity)\nErskine (charity) Erskine is a facility in Erskine, Scotland, that provides long-term medical care for veterans of the British Armed Forces. The charity opened and established itself as Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers in 1916. Its name was then shortened to Erskine Hospital and then simply Erskine in later years. It was opened due to the need to treat the thousands of military personnel who lost their limbs in the First World War. The charity has gone on to offer help to British veterans of the First World War and every subsequent war. It has gone on to become the biggest ex-services facility in the country. A need for a dedicated war hospital was apparent during the First World War, as hospitals were struggling to keep up with the demands of the many limbless soldiers and sailors returning from war. It was then thought that Scotland should have a large, modern war hospital to cope with these type of injuries. A charitable committee was formed after a meeting in Glasgow. Sir William Macewen, a chief surgeon, was at the forefront of pushing through the need for such a facility. He met with Sir Thomas Dunlop the Lord Provost of Glasgow, who was enthusiastic. The next stage was to find a location for the hospital in the west of Scotland. After reviewing several sites it was decided that Erskine would be the location. Thomas Aikman, the owner of Erskine House, which is a mansion on the banks of the River Clyde, offered free use of his mansion and gardens for the period of the war and for 12 years after it was declared over. Then Sir John Reid, a charity committee member, bought the mansion house and gardens and gifted them to the charity. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll agreed to become the patron of the hospital and within a few weeks the Scottish public had donated £100,000 towards the facility. The hospital was opened on 10 October 1916 and had an official opening on 6 June 1917 with Princess Louise making an appearance. Erskine's role has since expanded to meet the changing needs of war veterans. It now cares for all disabled ex-service people if their injuries were sustained during war. It also provides convalescent care for those recovering from illness. The Red Cross Convalescent Block was constructed in 1950 and by 1963 there were four new wards and a modern operating theatre known as Ross Wing. It was named in honour of Herbert M. Ross, who lost a leg while serving in the First World War. By 1980, there were new departments available for ex-service people. These included a social work and speech therapy department. Erskine House, which was the original hospital building, needed extensive work to continue as a working hospital. The building was sold as part of the vision to modernize Erskine. It was then turned into a 5-star hotel called the Earl of Mar, later known as Mar Hall. It opened in 2004. Colonel Martin Gibson, OBE, was the CEO between 1995 and 2009. He oversaw the biggest changes to Erskine as the charity had to modernize. The modernization program cost in the region of £20m. In 2000-01, the charity moved to two new purpose built sites in the town of Erskine. The Erskine Home was opened in 2000. The new flagship building replaced the original hospital building and is situated on grounds by the Erskine Bridge. This centre cost £16m and provides nursing and dementia care on a long term and respite basis. It has 180 beds available and is the biggest unit the charity has. Prince Charles, the charity's patron, opened the unit and unveiled a stone plaque to commemorate the opening. The Erskine Mains Home opened in 2001. The Princess Royal officially opened the unit, which is situated in the heart of Erskine town in Meadows Drive. With 34 beds, it heralded the completion of the first phase of Erskine 2000, a strategy to replace the existing building and take Erskine care Scotland-wide. This unit also provides nursing and dementia care on a 24-hour basis. The \"Erskine Park Home\" opened in 2006. It offers care for 40 residents and specializes in dementia care. It is situated again within rural parkland by the Erskine Bridge. The Princess Royal has maintained her strong links with the charity and once again opened this Erskine based unit. The Erskine Edinburgh Home was opened in 2001. It is situated in Gilmerton and has capacity for 88 residents. This was the charity's first unit outside the Erskine area. This was also opened by the Princess Royal. The Erskine Glasgow Home was opened by the Princess Royal in 2007. It is situated in Anniesland and has space for 46 residents. It also has partnership arrangements with care homes in Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness. Erskine has also rebuilt 50 veterans' cottages within the old hospital grounds at Erskine to house ex-service members and their families. This unit was opened as a training and conference facility. It is housed within the historic stable building at the hospital. It is jointly named after Sir John Reid, who gifted the mansion and gardens to the charity, and Sir William Macewen, the surgeon who pushed through the need for the hospital. As the building is Category B listed, the charity collaborated with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund on the renovation. It was officially opened in June 2001 by Wendy Alexander MSP. As Erskine is a charity it receives no government funding. Fundraising schemes are active throughout the year. The charity host an annual motorbike meet and classic car show. There is also an annual dog show. Within the hospital grounds there is a garden centre where profits go to the charity. Veterans also partake in various woodwork and craft activities. Items built are then sold and the profits released back into the charity. There is also an annual \"Erskine Week\". The fundraising event is to celebrate the official opening of the hospital in 1916. The charity will accept the help of volunteers from the public. There was a huge influx of injured military personnel returning from the First World War with missing limbs due to the fighting. Britain at this time was wholly dependent on foreign imports of artificial limbs. Sir William Macewan, the chief surgeon at the hospital, thought that this was intolerable. A dispensary and operating theatre were fitted out as workshops making artificial limbs. Mcewan also enlisted the help of a local shipbuilding company called Yarrow Shipbuilders. The company not only lent their yard but chose to have some of their best craftsmen working on the design and construction of the limbs. McEwan and Yarrows subsequently designed a new concept artificial limb known as the Erskine Artificial Limb. By December 1917 the hospital had treated 1,613 patients and of that number 1,126 required a new limb. And by 1920, there had been 9,500 artificial limbs fitted. Most of these were manufactured at the hospital’s workshops. The original hospital building is called Erskine House and is a Category A listed building. It is now the Mar Hall Hotel. There is a piggery, a stables yard and some other small buildings which also have listed status.", "Rehabilitation hospital\nRehabilitation hospital Rehabilitation hospitals, also referred to as inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, are devoted to the rehabilitation of patients with various neurological, musculo-skeletal, orthopedic and other medical conditions following stabilisation of their acute medical issues.

There are also inpatient rehabilitation hospitals that offer this service in a hospital-like setting, but separate from acute care facilities. Most inpatient rehabilitation facilities are located within hospitals. . Rehabilitation hospitals were created to meet a perceived need for facilities which were less costly on a per diem basis than general hospitals but which provided a higher level of professional therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy than can be obtained in a \"skilled nursing care\" facility. Rehabilitation hospitals are designed to meet the requirements imposed upon them by the Medicare administration, and to bill at the rates allowed by Medicare for such a facility. Medicare allows a lifetime total of 100 days' stay in a rehabilitation hospital per person. A rehabilitation hospital can only be accessed following a stay as an inpatient in a general hospital which has lasted for a certain number of days. The general hospital will evaluate the patient to determine if the patient will benefit from rehabilitation services. A positive determination will be made if the patient is deemed to require a certain level of therapies. If a positive determination is made, a report concerning the patient's needs will be sent to the rehabilitation hospital, which has the discretion to admit or not admit the patient. If the patient is transferred to the rehabilitation hospital, his/her medical records and a recommended treatment plan will be transmitted with the patient.

He is known for his makeup and special effects work on many films directed by George A. Romero, including \"Martin\", \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"Day of the Dead\", \"Creepshow\" and \"Monkey Shines\"; he also created the special effects and makeup for many cult classics like \"Friday the 13th\" (parts I and IV), \"Maniac\", \"The Burning\", \"The Prowler\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\". Savini directed \"Night of the Living Dead\", the 1990 remake of Romero's 1968 \"Night of the Living Dead\"; his other directing work include three episodes of the TV show \"Tales from the Darkside\" and one segment in \"The Theatre Bizarre\". As an actor and stuntman, he has appeared in films such as \"Martin\", \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"Knightriders\", \"From Dusk till Dawn\", \"Planet Terror\", \"Machete\", \"Django Unchained\" and \"Machete Kills\". Savini was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is of Italian descent. He was raised Catholic and graduated from Central Catholic High School. As a boy, his inspiration was actor Lon Chaney, Sr., and Savini attributes his earliest desires to create makeup effects to Chaney and the film \"Man of a Thousand Faces\". Experimenting with whatever medium he could find, the young Savini practiced creating makeup effects on himself, later convincing his friends to let him practice his craft on them. He also discovered another passion, acting. Combining his makeup applications and homemade costumes, he especially enjoyed scaring his friends. Savini attended Point Park University for three years, before enlisting in the United States Army. After his tour in Vietnam, he attended Carnegie-Mellon University, as the first undergraduate to be awarded a full fellowship in the acting and directing program. He appeared in stage productions throughout college and continued on stage long after his tour of duty in Vietnam. Savini served as a combat photographer during the Vietnam War. In a 2002 interview, he told the \"Pittsburgh Post\" \"When I was in Vietnam I was a combat photographer. My job was to shoot images of damage to machines and to people. Through my lens, I saw some hideous [stuff]. To cope with it, I guess I tried to think of it as special effects. Now, as an artist, I just think of creating the effect within the limitations we have to deal with.\" He continued to practice with makeup in Vietnam, often frightening indigenous peasants by appearing to suddenly transform into a \"monster\". Using the lens of his camera, Savini separated himself from the real life horrors of war; however, all the images still haunted his mind. Savini said his wartime experiences influenced his eventual style of gory effects: \"I hated that when I watched a war movie and someone dies. Some people die with one eye open and one eye half-closed, sometimes people die with smiles on their faces because the jaw is always slack. I incorporated the feeling of the stuff I saw in Vietnam into my work.\" In 1970, while on guard duty, a flare was triggered in the jungle area Savini was watching. Against military protocol, Savini fired into the bush without informing his superiors. Other soldiers likewise began firing until a duck wandered from the bush completely unharmed. Due to his failure to follow orders, Savini was taken off guard duty from his bunker on the following evening. That same evening, the bunker came under attack and several soldiers were wounded or killed. As a result of this incident, Savini earned the nickname \"Duck Slayer\" and to this day will not eat duck. Among the many talents Savini achieved as a young man was the art of fencing, he is a tournament fencer as well as an accomplished gymnast. Much of his stunt work and some of his characters reflect these graceful abilities; however, he is also accomplished with a bull whip and can easily execute a motorcycle stunt. Many of his characters have been bikers or madmen who are hardened and eerily evil. Savini is primarily known for his groundbreaking work in the field of special make-up effects, also known as prosthetic makeup. His signature style and techniques bring vivid realism to genre films. Early in Savini's career, Dick Smith became an inspiration and a guide, later becoming an associate at Savini's Special Make-up Effects Program. Among other projects, Smith is known for his groundbreaking work in \"The Exorcist\". Savini got his breakthrough working with Pittsburgh filmmaker George A. Romero, providing a convincing wrist-slashing effect in the opening scenes of \"Martin\" (1978). The following year, working with a larger budget on \"Dawn of the Dead\", Savini created his signature palette of severed limbs and bite-marks. In the 1980 slasher film \"Friday the 13th\", Savini expanded his repertoire of blood and gore. He continued to perfect those techniques in another film that year, \"Maniac\". Along with the 1981 films \"The Burning\" and \"The Prowler\", Savini earned the nickname \"The Sultan of Splatter\". In 1982, he created more traditional horror effects in the film \"Creepshow\" directed by George A. Romero and written by Stephen King. In 1984, he agreed to work on \"\", where he killed his creation Jason Voorhees. Returning to the zombie genre in 1985, Savini was nominated and won the 1985 Saturn Award for Best Makeup Effects for his work on the Romero's \"Day of the Dead\". In 1986, Savini worked with director Tobe Hooper on the film \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\". Savini has also worked on films by Italian director Dario Argento, first in 1990 on the film \"Two Evil Eyes\" and again on the 1993 film \"Trauma\". In the 1991 film \"Heartstopper\", he created special effects for director John A. Russo. Although focusing more on his acting career in recent years, Savini has continued to be active with special makeup effects and in 2011 supervised the effects for the Australian film \"Redd Inc\". As an actor, Savini has appeared in many of the same films he was creating effects for. His first appearance was a relatively straight, innocuous character in \"Martin\" in 1978; however, he played a menacing biker called Blades in his next film \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978), a role he reprised in zombie form with a cameo appearance in the 2005 continuation of the series, \"Land of the Dead\". In the 1980 film \"Maniac\", his brief role in the film found him facing the maniac's shotgun and having his head blown off in a spectacular display. Savini had a much more prominent role as biker and antagonist Morgan, the Black Knight, in George A. Romero's \"Knightriders\" (1981). Continuing with the biker theme, Savini played the universally recognized, whip-wielding, vampire-fighting biker \"Sex Machine\" in the 1996 Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez film \"From Dusk till Dawn\". (This character was a riff on Blades from \"Dawn of the Dead\" replete with the same costume.) In 2007, Savini had a role in \"Planet Terror\", one of two stories in the \"Grindhouse\" film, directed by Robert Rodriguez. Savini plays Deputy Tolo, who fights to save his town from an infestation of zombie-like creatures. In another Rodriguez film, \"Machete\", based on a fake movie trailer played during the film \"Grindhouse\", Savini played Osiris Amanpour, hired to track and kill the main character, Machete. Savini reprised his role in the sequel, \"Machete Kills\". Throughout the years, Savini has appeared in movie roles from cameos as the vampire David Van Etten in \"\", as the sheriff in the 2004 \"Dawn of the Dead\" remake, or tongue in cheek characters, like Jesus Christ in \"Zombiegeddon\" (2003). In 2006, Savini essayed the role of Prester John, the mythical villain in the dreamlike \"Sea of Dust\". That year also saw the release of Johannes Roberts' \"Forest of the Damned\", in which Savini played a mad hermit surrounded by angels cast from heaven. In 2008, he made a brief appearance in \"Zack & Miri Make a Porno\" as a thieving slumlord. He also appeared in \"The Dead Matter\", along with Andrew Divoff and Jim O'Rear. Savini voiced himself on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Worst Episode Ever\". While making an appearance at Android's Dungeon, Savini performs the \"Gutbuster\" gag, covering the crowd in \"blood and guts\" and consequently humiliating the Comic Book Guy. In 2012, Savini appeared as a shop teacher, Mr. Callahan, in the Pittsburgh-set teen drama \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", starring Logan Lerman. Savini also appeared as one of the Trackers in Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\". Future projects include Savini starring in the Nazi zombie film \"The 4th Reich\" directed by Shaun Robert Smith, playing the role of SS-Standartenführer Oskar Dirlewanger. As a film director, Savini helmed episodes of the syndicated television series \"Tales from the Darkside\", the aforementioned 1990 color remake of \"Night of the Living Dead\" and, \"House Call\", the pilot of the proposed series \"The Chill Factor\", which starred Pittsburgh actor Bingo O'Malley. In 2011, he directed \"Wet Dreams\", one of six segments to the horror film \"The Theatre Bizarre\". In 2009, Savini announced his plan to direct a new film, \"Death Island\", with special make-up effects by his former protege Greg Nicotero. On September 1, 2013, Savini began a crowd funding project on Indiegogo for \"Death Island\". His plans are to begin filming by the end of 2013. In the 2008 novel \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Jonathan Maberry, Savini appears as one of the real-world horror celebrities who are in the fictional town of Pine Deep when monsters attack; other celebrities include James Gunn, Jim O'Rear, Brinke Stevens, Ken Foree, Stephen Susco, Debbie Rochon, Joe Bob Briggs and blues man Mem Shannon. Savini also briefly took part in Jerry Lawler's 2010 revival of the \"Memphis Wrestling\" pro wrestling television show. His on-screen character sent horror-movie monsters (played by wrestlers from the Memphis area) onto the show to get revenge for Savini who blamed Lawler for the death of Savini's friend Andy Kaufman; the monsters' handler was manager \"Hollywood\" Jimmy Blaylock. In 2012, American filmmaker Jason Baker debuted a biography of Savini entitled \"Smoke and Mirrors: The Story of Tom Savini\". He stated during a Q&A with fans that the hardest movie he has ever worked on was \"Creepshow\" because it was \"5 movies in 1\". On January 15 2018, Savini announce via his Instagram that he would be directing a horror web series alongside several others, including Tina Romero, the late George A. Romero's daughter. Special effects for the web series will be completed by Savini's students at Pa Douglas Education Center. The web series is currently in production. Savini runs the Tom Savini's Special Make-Up Effects Program at the Douglas Education Center in Monessen, Pennsylvania. Savini is happy to say that he refers offers he receives for movie make-up effects projects to his students and graduates of his school as well.  Savini is the author of several books on special effects including \"Grande Illusions\" I and II (1983, 1994) which detail the production and mechanical workings of many of his famous film effects. In \"Horror F/X\", a 1989 direct-to-video interview conducted by frequent collaborator John A. Russo, Savini explains many of his effects techniques, illustrated by film clips and behind-the-scenes video footage. He is also associated with other books in the horror genre including \"Book of the Dead\" and \"Horror 101\" for which he wrote the foreword. Savini has also appeared in public demonstrating his effects, including two memorable appearances in the 1980s on \"Late Night With David Letterman\" in which he demonstrated such effects as \"fire gel\" and a gunshot to the head on Letterman himself.", "Prosthetic makeup\nProsthetic makeup Prosthetic makeup (also called Special make-up effects and FX prosthesis) is the process of using prosthetic sculpting, molding and casting techniques to create advanced cosmetic effects. Prosthetic makeup was revolutionized by John Chambers in such films as \"Planet of the Apes\" and Dick Smith in \"Little Big Man\". The process of creating a prosthetic appliance begins with lifecasting, the process of taking a mold of a body part (often the face) to use as a base for sculpting the prosthetic. Lifecast molds are made from prosthetic alginate or more recently, from skin-safe silicone rubber. This initial mold is relatively weak and flexible. A hard mother mold, typically made of plaster or fiberglass bandages is created overtop the initial mold to provide support. Once a negative mold has been created, it is promptly filled with gypsum cement, most commonly a brand called \"Ultracal-30\", to make a \"positive\" mold. The form of the prosthetic is sculpted in clay on top of the positive. The edges of the clay should be made as thin as possible, for the clay is a stand-in for what will eventually be the prosthetic piece. Along the edges of the mold, \"keys\" or mold points are sculpted or carved into the lifecast, to make sure that the two pieces of the mold will fit together correctly. Once sculpting is completed, a second mold is made. This gives two or more pieces of a mold - a positive of the face, and one or more negative mold pieces of the face with prosthetic sculpted in. All clay is carefully removed and the prosthetic material is cast into the mold cavity. The prosthetic material can be foam latex, gelatin, silicone or other similar materials. The prosthetic is cured within the two part mold - thus creating the beginning of a makeup effect. One of the hardest parts of prosthetic make-up is keeping the edges as thin as possible. They should be tissue thin so they are easy to blend and cover giving a flawless look. As the film/television industry continues to grow, so do the capabilities of the technologies behind it. Since the debut of newer technologies, many have feared that CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) will put practical SFX makeup out of business. More can be done with CGI than can be done with makeup as some things simply aren't possible when working in reality. Many views circulate on the subject. Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two experienced SFX artists from Amalgamated Dynamics near L.A., share what they see as the middle ground on the subject. In an interview, they explain that most movies use (out of necessity) a combination of practical effects and CGI. They see CGI as a tool that can be utilized in a good way or a bad way, just like practical effects. Tom Savini (an SFX artist known for his work in \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Creepshow\") states: \"They still use the make-up guys to design the creatures and that’s what they work from. I don’t think you’ll see make-up effects guys hanging out on corners with signs that say: \"WILL DO EFFECTS FOR FOOD\".” Special Effects Makeup isn't only used in films. A branch of SFX called Moulage is the process in which makeup is used to simulate different wounds and trauma in order to prepare medical, emergency, and military personnel for what they could experience in the field and lessen psychological trauma."], "neg": ["Voice changer\nVoice changer The term voice changer (also known as voice enhancer) refers Voice changers change the tone or pitch, add distortion to the user's voice, or a combination of all of the above and vary greatly in price and sophistication. A kazoo/didgeridoo can be used as a makeshift voice changer, though it can be difficult to understand what the person is trying to say. The earliest voice changers were electronic devices usually used over the telephone for the purpose of disguise. There are low-priced, small lithium battery-powered voice changers that are used between a phone's mouthpiece and the user's mouth.

{"query": "Rāhula's life story and teachings instead of just being known as Buddha's son in temple names.", "pos": ["Family of Gautama Buddha\nFamily of Gautama Buddha The Buddha was born into a noble family of the kshatriya varna in Lumbini, Nepal in 563 BCE. He was called Siddhartha Gautama in his childhood. His father was king Suddhodana, leader of the Shakya clan in what was the growing state of Kosala, and his mother was queen Maya Devi. According to Buddhist legend, the baby exhibited the marks of a great man. A prophecy indicated that if the child stayed at home he was destined to become a world ruler. If the child left home, however, he would become a universal spiritual leader. To make sure the boy would be a great king and world ruler, his father isolated him in his palace and he was raised by his mother's younger sister, Maha Pajapati, after his mother died just seven days after childbirth. Separated from the world, he later married Yashodhara (Yaśodhara was the daughter of King Suppabuddha and Amita), and together they had one child, a son, Rāhula. Both Yashodhara and Rāhul later became disciples of Buddha. His first cousin, by his father, Ananda, joined the Buddha as his attendant. Much of the information on Suddhodana comes from Buddhist legend and scripture. He is believed to be a leader of the Shakya clan, who lived within the state of Kosala, on the northern border of Ancient India. Although in Buddhist literature he is said to be a hereditary monarch, he is now believed to have been an elected head of a tribal confederacy. Suddhodana's father was Sinahana. Suddhodana was said to be greatly troubled by the departure of his son and is reported in Buddhist scriptures to have sent 10,000 messengers to plead with Gautama to return. After the Buddha preached the dharma to the messengers, they were all ordained into the sangha. Later a friend of Suddhodana named Kaludayi invited the Buddha to return, at the request of Suddhodana. The Buddha also preached the dharma to him and shubhansu was later ordained as a monk. After this request from his father Gautama Buddha returned to his father's kingdom where he preached dharma to him. Gautama later returned again to his father's kingdom to see his father's death. Suddhodana became an arahant. Maya was the mother of the Buddha and was from the Koliyan clan. Maya was born in Devadaha, in ancient Nepal. She was married to her cousin King Suddhodana, who ruled in the kingdom of Kapilavastu. In Buddhist texts, a white elephant was said to have entered her side during a dream. When she awoke she found that she was pregnant. As it was traditional to give birth in the homeland of the father, Queen Maya journeyed to Devadaha. However she was forced to give birth en route, in the Lumbini grove. It is said that the Devas presided over the birth and that two streams, one cool and one hot, flowed down from the heavens. Maya died seven days after the birth of her son, whom she had named Siddhartha or \"he who achieves his aim.\" She is said, in Buddhist scriptures, to have been reborn in Tusita, where her son later visited her, paid respects and taught the dharma to her. Ānanda was the primary attendant of the Buddha and one of his ten principal disciples. Among the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda stood out for having the best memory. Most of the texts of the early Buddhist \"Sutta-Piṭaka\" (Pāli; ) are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the First Buddhist Council. For that reason, he is known as the \"Treasurer of the Dhamma\", with \"Dhamma\" () referring to the Buddha's teaching. In Early Buddhist Texts, Ānanda is the first cousin of the Buddha. Although the texts do not agree on most things about Ānanda's early life, they do agree that Ānanda is ordained as a monk and that Puṇṇa Mantāniputta () becomes his teacher. Twenty years in the Buddha's ministry, Ānanda becomes the attendant of the Buddha, when the Buddha selects him for this job. Ānanda performs his duties with great devotion and care, and acts as an intermediary between the Buddha and the laypeople, as well as the Saṅgha (monastic community). He accompanies the Buddha for the rest of his life, acting not only as an assistant, but also a secretary and a mouthpiece. Scholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in Ānanda's life, especially the First Council, and consensus about this has yet to be established. A traditional account can be drawn from early texts, commentaries, and post-canonical chronicles. Ānanda has an important role in establishing the order of \"bhikkhunis\", when he requests the Buddha on behalf of the latter's foster-mother Mahāpajāpati Gotamī () to allow her to be ordained. Ānanda also accompanies the Buddha in the last year of his life, and therefore is witness to many tenets and principles that the Buddha conveys and establishes before his death, including the well-known principle that the Buddhist community should take his teaching and discipline as their refuge, and that the Buddha will not appoint a new leader. The final period of the Buddha's life also shows that Ānanda is still very much attached to the Buddha's person, and he witnesses the Buddha's passing with great sorrow. Shortly after the Buddha's death, the First Council is convened, and Ānanda manages to attain enlightenment just before the council starts, which is a requirement. He has a historical role during the council as the living memory of the Buddha, reciting many of the Buddha's discourses and checking them for accuracy. During the same council, however, he is chastised by Mahākassapa () and the rest of the Saṅgha for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments. Ānanda continues to teach until the end of his life, passing on his spiritual heritage to his pupils Sāṇavāsī () and Majjhantika (), among others, who later assume a leading role in the Second and Third Councils. Ānanda dies in 463 BCE, and \"stūpas\" (momuments) are erected at the river where he dies. Ānanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. Ānanda is known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and is often praised by the Buddha for these matters. He functions as a foil to the Buddha, however, in that he still has worldly attachments and is not yet enlightened, as opposed to the Buddha. In the Sanskrit textual traditions, Ānanda is widely considered the patriarch of the Dhamma, who stands in a spiritual lineage, receiving the teaching from Mahākassapa and passing them on to his own pupils. Ānanda has been honored by \"bhikkhunis\" since early medieval times for his merits in establishing the nun's order. In recent times, the composer Richard Wagner wrote a draft for a libretto about Ānanda, which was made into the opera Wagner Dream by Jonathan Harvey in 2007. Devadatta was the maternal first cousin (or in some accounts paternal first cousin) of the Buddha. He was ordained into the sangha along with his brothers and friends and their barber, Upāli, when the Buddha preached to the Shakyas in Kapilavastu. For a time, Devadatta was highly respected among the sangha. Shariputra is said to have sung the praises of Devadatta in Rajagaha. After some time, Devadatta developed siddhis and his intention is said to have been corrupted. After gaining these siddhis, Devadatta attempted to kill the Buddha on several occasions, commonly thought to be motivated by jealousy of the Buddha's power. He is reported to have rolled a boulder toward the Buddha, piercing his flesh, and to have incited an elephant to charge at the Buddha. Devadatta then attempted to split the sangha into two, with one faction led by himself and the other by the Buddha. However, this attempt failed as all of his converts returned to the Buddha's sangha. Devadatta was reputedly remorseful toward the Buddha late in life. He is reported to have walked to the monastery where the Buddha was staying to apologize to him but, as a result of bad karma, he was swallowed up into the earth and reborn in Avici before he could ask for forgiveness. Nanda was a half-brother of the Buddha; the son of King Suddhodana and Maha Prajapati Gautami. Nanda was to be married to a princess named Janapadakalyani but abandoned her to join the sangha. Nanda persevered and became an arhat. Maha Pajapati Gotami (Sanskrit: Maha Prajapati Gautami) was the youngest daughter of King Suppabuddha and Queen Amita. She was married to King Suddhodana with her elder sister Mahamaya (or Mayadevi). When her sister died after the birth of Siddartha Gautama she took Siddartha into her care. She also gave birth to a son, Nanda, to King Suddodhana. After the death of King Suddhodana, Maha Prajapati journeyed to find the Buddha. When she found him, she petitioned the Buddha, through Ananda, to allow women to enter the sangha as bhikkhuni. After many refusals, the Buddha finally agreed to allow women to enter the sangha as long as they accepted eight additional vinaya. These were: Maha Pajapati is said to have given the Buddha a robe made of fine cloth. The Buddha refused it, saying it was too elaborate and would cause the sangha to degenerate. Later Maha Pajapati became an arahant. Rāhula (Pāli and Sanskrit) was the only son of Siddhārtha Gautama, and his wife and princess Yaśodharā. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the early period onward. Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha's life and those of his family members. According to the Pāli tradition, Rāhula is born on the day of Prince Siddhārta's renunciation, and is therefore named \"Rāhula\", meaning a fetter on the path to enlightenment. According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, and numerous other later sources, however, Rāhula is only \"conceived\" on the day of Prince Siddhārtha, and is born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha becomes enlightened as the Buddha. This long gestation period is explained by bad karma from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more naturalistic reasons are also given. As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needs to prove that Rāhula is really Prince Siddhārtha's son, which she eventually does successfully by an act of truth. Historian has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen's permission, but Orientalist considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace. Between seven to fifteen years after Rāhula is born, the Buddha returns to Kapilavastu, where Yaśodharā has Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the Śākya clan. The Buddha responds by having Rāhula ordain as the first Buddhist novice monk. He teaches the young novice about truth, self-reflection, and not-self, eventually leading to Rāhula's enlightenment. Although early accounts state that Rāhula dies before the Buddha does, later tradition has it that Rāhula is one of the disciples that outlives the Buddha, guarding the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of the next Buddha. Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning, and was honored by novice monks and nuns throughout Buddhist history. His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand."], "neg": ["Rajula\nRajula Rajula is a city and municipality in Amreli district in the Indian state of Gujarat.

The project primarily consists of a series of free public workshops. A successor to the Cypherpunks of the 1990s, CryptoParty was conceived in late August 2012 by an Australian journalist who goes by the \"pen name\" Asher Wolf in a Twitter post following the passage of the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and the proposal of a two-year data retention law in that country, the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The DIY, self-organizing movement immediately went viral, with a dozen autonomous CryptoParties being organized within hours in cities throughout Australia, the US, the UK, and Germany. As of mid-October 2012 some 30 CryptoParties have been held globally, some on a continuing basis, and CryptoParties were held on the same day in Reykjavik, Brussels and Manila. CryptoParty has received early messages of support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and (purportedly) AnonyOps, as well as the NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake, WikiLeaks central editor Heather Marsh, and \"Wired\" reporter Quinn Norton. Eric Hughes, the author of \"A Cypherpunk's Manifesto\" nearly two decades before, delivered the keynote address, \"Putting the Personal Back in Personal Computers\", at the Amsterdam CryptoParty on 2012-09-27. Marcin de Kaminski, founding member of Piratbyrån which in turn founded The Pirate Bay, regards CryptoParty as the most important civic project in cryptography today, and Cory Doctorow has characterized a CryptoParty as being \"like a Tupperware party for learning crypto.\" \"Der Spiegel\" in December 2014 mentioned \"crypto parties\" in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks in an article about the NSA. The first draft of the 442-page \"CryptoParty Handbook\" (the hard copy of which is available at cost), was pulled together in three days using the book sprint approach, and was released 2012-10-04 under a CC-BY-SA license; it remains under constant revision. In April and May 2013, the movement's main wiki page, cryptoparty.org, was subject to a series of spam attacks that eventually resulted in the site being taken out of service. Protection against spam attacks was rendered more difficult than on other wikis by a site-specific policy permitting edits from users employing anonymization services.

In May 2014, \"Wired\" reported that Edward Snowden, while employed by Dell as an NSA contractor, organized a local CryptoParty at a small hackerspace in Honolulu, Hawaii on December 11, six months before becoming well known for leaking tens of thousands of secret U.S. government documents. During the CryptoParty, Snowden taught 20 Hawaii residents how to encrypt their hard drives and use the Internet anonymously.

The Sassaman-Efficient method is the first of the 2 types developed. Before the event all participants email the keysigning coordinator their public keys. The coordinator then makes a text file of all the keys and accompanied fingerprint and then hashes it. They then proceed to make the text file and checksum available to all participants. The participants then download the file and check the validity using the hash. Then the participants print out the list and make sure that their own key is correct.

The signatures are then uploaded to the server or mailed directly to the key owner (if requested).

Typically, group keys are distributed by sending them to individual users, either physically, or encrypted individually for each user using either that user's pre-distributed private key. A common use of group keys is to allow a group of users to decrypt a broadcast message that is intended for that entire group of users, and no-one else.  For example, in the Second World War, group keys (known as \"iodoforms\", a term invented by a classically educated non-chemist, and nothing to do with the chemical of the same name) were sent to groups of agents by the Special Operations Executive. These group keys allowed all the agents in a particular group to receive a single coded message. In present-day applications, group keys are commonly used in conditional access systems, where the key is the common key used to decrypt the broadcast signal, and the group in question is the group of all paying subscribers. In this case, the group key is typically distributed to the subscribers' receivers using a combination of a physically distributed secure cryptoprocessor in the form of a smartcard and encrypted over-the-air messages."]}

First-time filmmaker and former \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Neil Barsky’s 2012 documentary film \"Koch\" explores the origins, career, and legacy of Edward Irving “Ed” Koch, who served as Mayor of New York City for three consecutive terms from 1978 to 1989. With candid interviews and rare archival footage, the film offers a close look at a man known for being intensely private in spite of his dynamic public persona, and chronicles the tumultuous events which marked his time in office – a fiercely competitive 1977 election, the 1980 transit strike, the burgeoning AIDS epidemic, landmark housing renewal initiatives, and an irreparable municipal corruption scandal. Poignant and often humorous, \"Koch\" is a portrait not only of one of New York’s most iconic political figures, but of New York City itself at a time of radical upheaval and transformation.  \"Both as a portrait of a changing New York City and the man who was at the epicentre of that evolution for over a decade, \"Koch\" is a delight.

The Quattrocento encompasses the artistic styles of the late Middle Ages (most notably International Gothic), the early Renaissance (beginning around 1425), and the start of the High Renaissance, generally asserted to begin between 1495 and 1500. After the decline of the Western Roman Empire in 476, economic disorder and disruption of trade spread across Europe. This was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages, which lasted roughly until the 11th century, when trade picked up, population began to expand and the papacy regained its authority. In the late Middle Ages, the political structure of the European continent slowly evolved from small, highly unstable fiefdoms into larger nation states ruled by monarchies, thereby providing greater stability. In Italy, urban centers arose that were populated by merchant and trade classes, who were able to defend themselves. Money replaced land as the medium of exchange, and increasing numbers of serfs became freedmen. The changes in Medieval Italy and the decline of feudalism paved the way for social, cultural, and economic changes. The Quattrocento is viewed as the transition from the Medieval period to the age of the Renaissance, principally in the cities of Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice and Naples. Quattrocento art shed the decorative mosaics typically associated with Byzantine art along with the Christian and Gothic media of and styles in stained glass, frescoes, illuminated manuscripts and sculpture. Instead, Quattrocento artists and sculptors incorporated the more classic forms developed by Roman and Greek sculptors. Since the Quattrocento overlaps with part of the Renaissance, it would be inaccurate to say that a particular artist was Quattrocento \"or\" Renaissance.

Agnone is known for the manufacturing of bells by the Marinelli Bell Foundry. It is some northwest of Campobasso. The town of Agnone proper is complemented with other populated centers like Fontesambuco, Villa Canale and Rigaini. The pre-Roman Samnites consisted of several distinct tribes who existed in Samnium which was a wholly inland district of south central Italy. The Pentri tribe of the Samnites was the most powerful and based in Bovianium, which was a city some north of present Agnone. Agnone is in the center of important archaeological vestiges of the old Oscan-Samnite civilization and is sometimes called “\"the Athens of the Sannio\"” due to the large number of ancient ruins of the Samnitic culture. According to the tradition, the name of Agnone derives from the old city of Aquilonia that was destroyed by the Romans. The Samnites were annihilated at the time of Sulla by the consuls Carvilius and Lucius Papirius Cursor in 293 B.C. Papirius, after making himself master of Aquilonia, which he burnt to the ground, proceeded to besiege Saepinum, on his way to Bovianum. Agnone also lays claim to the most important ancient Molise document: the so-called \"Oscan Tablet\" (“Tabula Osca”), a bronze inscription written in the Oscan alphabet that dates from the 3rd century BC and now kept in the British Museum. The Samnites spoke Oscan and knowledge of the Oscan language is furnished on this small bronze tablet, which was discovered at Fonte di Romito, between Capracotta and Agnone in 1848. The place of discovery was near the river Sagrus or Sangro; this inscription is an example of the most southerly dialect of the Samnite language. The tablet speaks of a series of dedications to different deities or holy beings During the Roman Period, Christianity was spread to Molise. Agnone appears on Roman maps under different regions at various times as Aprutium, Picenum, Sabina et Samnium, Flaminia et Picenum and/or Campania et Samnium. The Roman penchant for building seems to have passed Agnone over as Samnitic architecture still prevailed. Agnone was an important center during the rule of the Lombards, but then was left decaying in the centuries immediately preceding 1000, while the Verrino Valley and surrounding hills became a place of hermitages, monasteries and small agricultural colonies. In 1139 the powerful Borrello family, supported by soldiers of fortune from Venice, probably originating from colonies Dalmatian of the \"Serenissima\" took control of Agnone. The importance of Agnone grew during the Angevin and also in the Aragonese reigns to the point that during the reign of the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies, the city was among the 56 royal towns, that reported directly to the King, and was free from any other type of feudal subjection. Joseph Bonaparte decided to create the region Molise, that was to exclude Agnone, but during the reign of Joachim Murat, the elders of Agnone asked and obtained the transition to Molise, basing the request on the geographical difficulties of the links to Abruzzo, and hoping to rise to a new role for the small region. During this period, the natural resources surrounding Agnone impacted its economy where skilled craftsmen produced gold jewelry, copperware, watches, and bells. Agnone would suffer a significant decline in years following the Unification of Italy in the 1860s. In 1884 the local newspaper \"L'Aquilonia\" reviewed the causes of emigration of peasants from Agnone and concluded that the two main factors were excessive taxes on consumers' goods and usurious interest rates that at times surpassed 20 percent in the town. The peasants were arrested for stealing the crops of the \"galantuomini\" (\"gallant men\" or ruling class), and a particularly frequent crime was the illegal cutting of timber on the town commons. In 1863, for example, the authorities actually prosecuted 624 cases of illegal felling of trees. Consequently, when by the 1870s, owing to improvements in sea travel, a lowering of fares, and the expansive nature of the economies of both the United States and the Rio de la Plata region of southern South America, transatlantic emigration became a viable alternative, the lower classes of Agnone were, out of a sense of desperation, prime candidates. Politically alienated by decades of unfulfilled promises of land reform, mired in endemic poverty, dependent on a rapacious class of galantuomini for what was, by any yardstick, a meager existence, the peasantry was further squeezed by relentless population increase throughout the first seven decades of the 19th century. When Benito Mussolini's fascist regime came to power, they effectively put a stop to Italy's out migration. During the Fascist era, Agnone was the site of exile for many opponents of the ruling party, including Don Raimondo Viale, protagonist of \"The Just Priest\" by Nuto Revelli. The Germans sat up a concentration camp in Molise for gypsies where Father Viale tried to help them. The War would finally reach Agnone in December 1943, as the Allied Forces would land on Italy's Adriatic coast and make their way northward and westward to Rome. The 1st Canadian Infantry Division would drive the Germans and Fascists out of Molise, and on 2 and 3 December, the West Nova Scotia Regiment would billet in Agnone during the Ortona offensive. After the war, Agnone's out migration issues continued, although more for reasons of economic availability. As international emigration declined, southern Italians migrated to industrial northern Italy for more promising economic prospects. Presently, Agnone's population is still declining. As Molise is starting to find recognition as a tourist destination, Agnone is marketing itself on the agritourism market and for its unique Pre-Roman and Medieval architecture. The town's medieval-style architecture is reflected in its nineteen churches, including the Church of San Marco, with a large Renaissance portal embellished by a copper lion. In the 11th century Odorisio and Gualtiero Borrello introduced the cult of Saint Mark and brought artists from Venice to decorate their homes with Saint Mark's lion. This church is adorned with great artwork including: rich altars, a painting of a \"Holy Family and Saints\" by Luca Giordano; an obstensory in gilded copper and enamel, by Giovanni da Agnone, a disciple of Nicola da Guardiagrele. The church of Sant'Antonio Abate has a Romanesque portal and a 17th-century bell tower, and on the vault inside a giant fresco by Francesco Palumbo. Sant'Emidio has a 12th-century portal and rich works of art including wooden painted statues that are taken out on Good Thursday and Friday for a re-enactment of the Last Supper. The church of Corso Garibaldi, is sided by ancient houses with stone lions near the doors (the lion is on Agnone coat of arms), ancient artisans' workshops, Apollonio house and Nuonno house. Church of San Francesco displays a giant round window over the portal, dated 1330. Inside, the \"Final Judgment\" on the vault is painted by Gambora. The Church of San Nicola has a peculiar bell tower coated with yellow and green ceramic tiles. It is due to Agnone’s craftsmen and medieval architecture that the town adopted the nickname \"Città d'Arte\" (City of Art) which the town uses on a promotional basis. The Pontificia Fonderia Marinelli (the Marinelli Pontifical Foundry) is an ancient factory of bells which has been operating in Agnone for nearly a millennium. It ranks as one of the oldest companies in the world, where the Marinelli family has run the foundry for the last 1000 years. This factory has a museum, where bells of almost a thousand years of antiquity to more recent others are displayed. It is also possible to observe the artisan process of the manufacturing of bells. The factory was visited by the Pope John Paul II in 1995 as many of the foundry’s bells can be found at the Vatican. Agnone lies on a rocky spear in the mountainous regions of Molise (Alto Molise). Farms and country houses surround the city at elevations varying from the above sea level at Monte Castelbarone to of the Verrino River bed. The Sangro River also passes by Agnone. Its geographic position has been described as \"The natural capital of the Alto Molise\". Its territorial extension covers made up of forests, pastures and agriculture land. From a geomorphological point of view, the area is affected by several landslides. For example, in January 2003, a huge landslide occurred in the municipality of Agnone causing important damage to infraestructures. On Christmas Eve Agnone holds the \"\"Carnevale Agnonese\"\", including the \"Ndocciata\", which is a huge torchlight parade of thousands of handmade, wooden torches made into nine different quarters (\"borgate\"), accompanied by the sound of bagpipes, to the Piazza Plebiscito where a brotherhood bonfire is lit. The \"Fiera delle Arti e Mestieri Antichi\" (Arts and Antique Crafts Fair) is held 17 to 19 August where a large area of the old town home to artisans, display their works. Artisan's crafts at the fair generally include goldsmiths, tinkers, tanners, wrought-iron, lace and embroidery.  <br>"]}

It currently broadcasts from studios in Pyrmont, New South Wales. Electrical Utilities applied to the Postmaster-General's Department for a licence for a new B Class (later commercial) station licence. The station was to have the call-sign 2EU, based on the initials of Electrical Utilities. However, before the licence, \"PMG - Broadcasting Station Licence\" No.12, was issued on 7 November 1924, Electrical Utilities advised the PMG that it wished to reverse the initials in the call-sign - thus the licence was issued to 2UE. 2UE opened on 26 January 1925. The founder of Electrical Utilities and 2EU/2UE was Cecil \"Pa\" Stevenson, who was also 2UE's chief engineer, and one of the most prominent personalities in Australia's early broadcasting history. Prior to opening 2UE, he had operated experimental station 2IY, as well as working alongside a couple of other early experimenters. The original studio was in the dining room of Stevenson's Maroubra home; and an 80 feet (24.384 metres) transmitting tower was installed in his back yard. All the equipment was homemade; the studio and equipment costing £750 ($1,500) to build, and £9 ($18) per week to operate. Within a short time the studios were moved to Stevenson's radio store in George Street, Sydney. Most programming was provided by 78 rpm recordings or player piano rolls. It is reputed that whilst changing records or rolls, Stevenson would whistle so as to prevent dead air. 2UE was originally on the air daily from 8.00 pm to 10.00 pm. The station is reputed to have broadcast Australia's first radio advertisement. A local butcher was so disconcerted with the sounds between recordings and piano rolls that he paid Stevenson one shilling (10¢) to substitute his whistling with short talks about the quality of the butcher's meat. One shilling then became the station's standard advertising rate. There are records of early 2UE broadcasts being picked-up in the USA and New Zealand. 2UE is the oldest current commercial radio station in Australia. In 1929, through Cecil Stevenson, 2UE experimented with sending pictures by radio using radiovision or mechanical television. The experiments were short-lived due to the lack of receivers to pick up the transmissions. (Melbourne stations 3UZ and 3DB also both conducted similar experimental transmissions in 1929.) As a cost saving measure in the depths of the Great Depression, in December 1935 it was announced that an organisation to be known as Broadcasting Service Association, Limited, would co-ordinate and provide combined production resources for 2UE and 2GB, but without owning or operating either station. On 7 January 1937, it was announced that the two stations would operate as the \"Red Network\" and the \"Blue Network\"; a concept which was copied from the US's NBC network, which operated a Red Network and Blue Network at this time. However, the concept never transpired in Australia, because in February 1937 2GB announced that it was going to form its own national network, and that eventually led to the formation of the Macquarie Network in 1938 which was at first jointly managed by 2GB and 2UE. In 1938 2UE and 3DB Melbourne, launched the Major Broadcasting Network which for many decades was Australia's second most important radio network, after the Macquarie Network. The main person behind the formation of the Major Network was David Worrall, manager of 3DB, and a most important figure in broadcasting history. The Major Network's Sydney outlet later changed from 2UE to 2CH and then to 2UW before 2UE yet again became the Major Network outlet in Sydney in September 1950 The Network broadcast a wide range of live variety programs including quizzes and dramas including soap operas, mostly emanating from the 3DB or 2UE studios. The formation of the Major Network actually happened after two earlier attempts by David Worrall to form a network with 2UE as the Sydney station. In 1933, a loose grouping, but the first Australian attempt to form a commercial network, was attempted, known as the Federal Network. Then, in 1933 the Associated Broadcasters of Australia was formed but, again, did not last long. In 1938 2UE and 2GB, as partners in the newly formed Broadcast Services Association moved their studios and offices to Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney, with 2UE on the 4th and 5th floors and 2GB on the 6th and 7th floors. In 1930 a new transmitter was installed at Lilli Pilli. In 1933–34 Stevenson sold the station to Associated Newspapers Ltd, publishers of The Sun. In 1938 the station was commencing its broadcasts at 6.00 am with \"The Alarm Clock\".  From 1939, 2UE became the first Australian station to broadcast six pips from the Australian observatory as an hourly time signal. For many decades all Australian stations carried the six pip time signal first heard on 2UE, and some stations still do. The 2UE Dramatic Players were established in the 1930s providing a number of dramas and serials on a repertory basis. The Players were led by George Edwards, arguably the most prominent radio actor and producer of the time. Some time later, Paul Jacklin was appointed as 2UE's head of production. Malcolm \"Max\" Afford also played an important role 2UE's dramatic productions in the 1930s and into the 1940s. Right up to the early 1960s 2UE was to produce many dozens of audio plays for the Major Broadcasting Network. These mainly consisted of 15 minute serials or soap operas and 30 minute dramas. However, probably the most important dramatic production to emanate from the 2UE studios was the Australian version of the \"Lux Radio Theatre\" which was heard at 8.00 pm every Sunday evening until 1952 – in pre-television days, arguably the most listened-to hour in the week for any radio station. (For much of its time on air, the Lux Radio Theatre was in competition with 2GB's \"Macquarie Radio Theatre\" later known as the \"Caltex Theatre\".) 2UE transmitted many live musical broadcasts during this era. These ranged from classical to pop. The importance of these types of programming at that time, is highlighted by the fact that in 1933 the 2UE Academy of Music was formed under Rex Shaw and Professor Clarence Elkin, so as to train singers and instrumentalists, particularly in the classical field. However, the Academy only lasted about a year. In the 1930s, Test Cricket had a particularly high profile and most capital city radio stations, both the ABC and commercial stations, used the cricket as a vehicle for competitive programming, often interspersing live variety programs with news of the ongoing match supplied by overseas cablegrams. In 1931 a Sydney menswear store arranged for Don Bradman to broadcast twice weekly during the cricket season. He was on a two-year contract at the very high sum of £1,000 a year; a deal which is credited with keeping Bradman in Australia. Bradman also regularly played the piano during 2UE's weekly \"Call to Youth\" program, In July 1941 Prime Minister Robert Menzies officially opened a new 1,000 watt transmitter at Concord. The transmitter tower was wired with explosives by the army, so that an enemy could not have used it, should there have been a World War II invasion. Fire destroyed the Savoy House studios in 1943, and another Sydney station, 2CH, gave 2UE temporary accommodation in their own studio complex. 2UE was well known over many decades for its coverage of races, both in Sydney and, through relays, of meetings throughout Australia. It also relayed Sydney races both through Major Broadcasting Network affiliates and through other stations. The 2UE racing service commenced in 1945 when Sports Editor Clif Cary, already well known for his cricket broadcasts, started a service then known as the Associated Sports Broadcasts which relayed horse racing and other Saturday afternoon sporting events to nine other N.S.W. stations. The racing service ended in 1983 when Des Hoysted called the last race to be broadcast by 2UE. Amongst the long list of 2UE race-callers are the following: Clif Cary, Ken Howard, Des Hoysted, Andrew Martin and Harry Solomons. During this era, 2UE was known as The Modern Station. In 1954 John Lamb purchased 2UE from Associated Newspapers, for £165,000 ($330,000). Lamb also owned 2KO Newcastle, New South Wales. John Lamb died in 1978, and his son, Stewart, moved from Newcastle to Sydney to look after the Lamb family's interests in 2UE. Gary O'Callaghan was Sydney's number one breakfast announcer for 28 years, winning 159 surveys. 2UE instigated Australia's first Top 40 on 2 March 1958, with former Newcastle announcer Pat Barton as the host of a daily Top 40 program. The number one song on the very first Top 40 chart was Pat Boone's April Love During the 1960s, the station was known as The Brighter 2UE. In the early 1960s, 2UE dropped virtually all of its variety and drama shows. It was considered that television had become the home for these types of programming. 2UE increased its reliance on a Top 40 format, becoming one of the first stations in Australia to devote most of its air time to pop music, but by the end of this decade 2SM had superseded 2UE as Sydney's most popular Top 40 station. Popular 2UE DJs in this era included Bob Rogers,Tony Withers and John Laws. Commencing in 1966, a major pop music promotion on 2UE Sydney and 3UZ Melbourne was Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, a national rock band concert staged to promote Australian talent and foster new bands. However, after a few years, 2SM was appointed as the Sydney outlet for the Battle of the Sounds, replacing 2UE. One popular variety program that did survive for many years was the \"National Old Time Dance\" with Jack Papworth's orchestra, every Friday evening. It was relayed to stations across Australia. At one stage it was broadcast from The Albert Palais, Leichhardt. Until 1967 talkback was illegal in Australia because of government concerns that: a) people may say something they shouldn't; and b) callers may not know they were on the air. Nevertheless, many stations, particularly 2UW in Sydney and 3AK Melbourne, did broadcast talkback from 1963. However, 2UE and 3DB (Melbourne) were the first Australian stations to legally present talkback, commencing on 17 April 1967. Journalist Ormsby Wilkins was the first 2UE talkback host. Although 2UE was mainly broadcasting Top 40 during this period, in the early 1970s it also featured some country music, including programs hosted by Studio Manager Nick Erby. John Laws also included a deal of country music in his programs. The Lamb family sold 2UE to Kerry Packer in the 1980s, and Packer then sold it to Alan Bond but when the Bond Empire was crumbling in the early 1990s,the Lamb family was to buy back 2UE. In 1986, under Kerry Packer, 2UE and 3AK Melbourne, embarked on a shared talk-back format called the CBC Network which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney based programs being broadcast across both stations. Two separate breakfast programs were broadcast for both Sydney and Melbourne but that was the only shift with separate programming. All other programs, whether emanating from Sydney or Melbourne, were heard over both stations. Well-known Sydney and Melbourne news broadcaster and radio management expert Brian White managed both stations. However, the CBC experiment was a short-lived failure. In 1984 2UE ran a competition, \"Millionaire Mania\" in which a prize of $20,000 a year for 50 years, was offered. This was believed to be the largest ever radio prize, to that date! 2UE management was no doubt relieved when Premier Neville Wran drew out the name of someone described as an \"older lady\". 2UE was the centre of the cash for comment affair, an Australian scandal that broke in 1999. It concerned paid advertising on talk back radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. The affair was first reported on the ABC program \"Media Watch\" by reporters Richard Ackland, Deborah Richards and Ann Connelly. They revealed that 2UE hosts John Laws and Alan Jones had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including Qantas, Optus, Foxtel, Mirvac and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. The Australian Broadcasting Authority found that John Laws, Alan Jones, and 2UE had committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE's license conditions. 2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws's improper conduct. In a statement Fairfax Radio said the station will undergo significant changes to its line-up in 2014, with national content director Clark Forbes saying: “The changes to 2UE will reveal a new and reinvigorated station that better reflects our influential and informed audience. “We’d like to thank outgoing presenters Paul Murray and Jason Morrison from the Morning and Drive programs and wish them well in the future. We're preparing for a big year for 2UE in 2014.\" 2UE continued to broadcast a news talk format, involving current affairs oriented programs with talkback across the day and more relaxed programming at nights and on weekends. News updates were broadcast at the top of every hour, provided by Macquarie Radio Network. In March 2001, the Lamb family sold 2UE and 4BC to Southern Cross Broadcasting for a reputed $90 million. In July 2007, Fairfax Media purchased all of Southern Cross Broadcasting's metro radio assets, including 2UE, 3AW and 4BC. On 22 December 2014, it was announced that Fairfax's radio division and Macquarie Radio Network would merge. The merger was finalised on 1 April 2015. Despite having had a strong relationship in the 1930s through the Broadcast Services Association, by the 21st century 2UE had been a constant rival of 2GB for many decades. Both of these Sydney stations had offered a similar format. In the early 2010s 2UE slipped badly in the ratings, suffering major blows when long time breakfast program host Alan Jones moved across to the 2GB breakfast program and when broadcaster John Laws retired from radio, leaving his 2UE morning program at the end of 2007. On 9 April 2015, with 2UE and 2GB now both owned by the newly merged Macquarie Radio Network, the 2UE newsroom was closed after 90 years with the last news report being broadcast at 6 pm that day. The news teams of both stations were merged with \"significant job cuts.\" In the eighth and final ratings survey for 2013, released on 10 December 2013, overall 2UE scored a 4.2% market share well behind market leader 2GB on 13.3 which was ahead of next placed ABC702 on 10.4. This rating placed 2UE tenth out of the 14 surveyed stations. During this survey period, its Monday to Friday share slipped to 3.2 per cent of the available audience, putting it behind Macquarie Radio Network's 2CH which averaged 4.6 per cent and meant 2UE was only ahead of three stations. The 2UE drive show slipping a further 0.7 points after the firing of Jason Morrison in the middle of the survey, and evenings slipping further losing 2.6 points, its biggest drop in the survey. On 1 November 2013, 2UE's parent company, Fairfax Radio Network (FRN), announced that it had signed a five-year contract commencing with the 2013/2014 Australian cricket season, to broadcast the Boxing Day and Sydney Test matches, all One Day Internationals, the Big Bash League (BBL) and International T20 matches on network stations including 2UE. Subsequently, in December 2013, FRN decided on an earlier start to their coverage by including the Perth test match which commenced on 13 December 2013. Fairfax stated that \"Fairfax Radio Network will bring to its coverage more than 60 years' experience of broadcasting sport, assembling a star-studded commentary line up\". The coverage will provide a ball-by-ball commentary of all broadcast matches. The commentary team is anchored by Tim Lane and Bruce Eva, together with a panel consisting of the following experts A number of parties have attempted to sue 2UE for defamation. In February 2012 Mamdouh Habib won his claim and was awarded almost $150,000. 2UE was found to have defamed journalist Ray Chesterton in an August 2005 broadcast made by John Laws. In September 2016, 2UE relaunched with new branding and programming, moving away from its news talk position to a lifestyle format.

He was a founder member and lead singer of 1960s British pop band Amen Corner, and in recent years has toured extensively with Roger Waters, Eric Clapton and Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. Fairweather Low was born in Ystrad Mynach, Wales. He first found fame as a founding member of the pop group Amen Corner in the late 1960s. They had four successive Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, including the #1 single \"(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice\" in 1969. The overnight success and Fairweather Low's teen idol looks, as music journalist William Ruhlmann noted at Allmusic; \"... put his attractive face on the bedroom walls of teenage girls all over Britain\". The band split in two in 1970, with Fairweather Low leading Dennis Byron (drums), Blue Weaver (organ), Clive Taylor (bass) and Neil Jones (guitar) into a new band, Fair Weather. The band scored a UK Singles Chart No. 6 hit with \"Natural Sinner\" in July 1970, although the outfit's albums, \"Beginning From An End\" and \"Let Your Mind Roll On\", failed to chart. After twelve months Fairweather Low left to pursue a solo career, releasing four albums up to 1980 on A&M and Warner Bros. These spawned further single chart success with \"Reggae Tune\" (1974), and \"Wide Eyed and Legless\", a No. 6 Christmas time hit in 1975. Welsh group Budgie covered \"I Ain't No Mountain\" off Fairweather Low's 1974 album \"Spider Jiving\" on their 1975 release \"Bandolier\". In the late 1970s and 1980s he worked for numerous artists as a session musician, performing as a backing vocalist and guitarist on albums by Roy Wood, Leo Sayer, Albion Band, Gerry Rafferty, Helen Watson, and Richard and Linda Thompson. In 1978, Fairweather Low sang backing vocals on the album \"Who Are You\", from The Who, specifically on the tracks \"New Song\", \"Had Enough\", \"Guitar and Pen\", \"Love is Coming Down\", and \"Who Are You\". On the Who's 1982 album \"It's Hard\", he played rhythm guitar on the song \"It's Your Turn\". Fairweather Low later appeared on Townshend's 1993 album \"Psychoderelict\" and the accompanying concert tour. In 1995, Fairweather Low played rhythm guitar on Joe Satriani's self-titled CD, along with Nathan East on bass and Manu Katché on drums. One reviewer commented that \"this backup band of extremely gifted backup musicians sincerely adds a diverse range of textures and colors, bringing out a much-needed live feel to an otherwise bland album of blues-oriented jazz-rock.\" Fairweather Low has worked with Roger Waters since Waters' \"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\" tour of America in 1985. He contributed to two of Waters' albums – \"Radio KAOS\" in 1987 and \"Amused to Death\" in 1992. He played guitar and bass on Roger Waters' all-star performance of \"The Wall – Live in Berlin\" 21 July 1990, on the 1999–2002 \"In the Flesh\" world tour and was playing on Waters' \"Dark Side of the Moon Live\" world tour in 2006 and 2007, but was not able to perform with him in 2008. His role was picked up by session guitarist Chester Kamen. In 1992, he began working on projects alongside Eric Clapton. Fairweather Low had earlier appeared in Clapton's band in the 1983 ARMS concerts for Ronnie Lane and, while he has continued to do session work for various people, including Dave Edmunds, Fairweather Low has spent most of his time since the early 1990s as a sideman in Clapton's backing band, as well as session work; notably Clapton's \"Unplugged\" concerts, as well as on \"From The Cradle\". In the same year, he was present on tours with the 1999 Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris collaboration. In December 1991, he played guitar on George Harrison's \"Live in Japan\", along with the rest of Clapton's band, and in 2002, he played several of the lead guitar parts for the Harrison tribute \"Concert for George\", on some songs playing Harrison's famous Fender Stratocaster \"Rocky\" and Harrison's gold Fender Electric XII. In 2004 he appeared in the Stratpack concert, celebrating 50 years of the Fender Stratocaster. From 1998 to 2002, he played in Roger Waters' In the Flesh tour. In 2001, Fairweather Low accompanied Eric Clapton on his world tour and is featured on the 2002 album \"One More Car, One More Rider\", which also features accompaniment by Billy Preston, Steve Gadd, Nathan East and David Sancious. In 2002, Fairweather Low featured on \"From Clarksdale To Heaven – Remembering John Lee Hooker\" with, amongst others, Jeff Beck, Gary Brooker, Jack Bruce and Peter Green. By 2005, he toured extensively with Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. Some of the concerts were recorded for UK television, as part of their \"50 Years of Rock 'n' Roll\" tribute. In April 2005 he played in the Gary Brooker Ensemble's charity concert at Guildford Cathedral, Surrey, in aid of the Tsunami Appeal. In 2006, Fairweather Low toured with Roger Waters once more, this time for the latter's The Dark Side of the Moon tour, and with Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. In the same year Fairweather Low toured with Chris Barber and the Big Chris Barber Band reprising many of his earlier hits, including \"Gin House Blues\" and \"Worried Man Blues\". Some of these performances form part of Barber's latest CD, \"Can't Stop Now\", featuring new arrangements by Barber's staff-arranger and trombonist, Bob Hunt. Also in 2006 Fairweather Low released \"Sweet Soulful Music\", his first solo album in twenty-six years. The song \"Hymn for My Soul\" became the title track of Joe Cocker's 2007 album. Cocker's tour of 2007/08 bore the same title. In 2007, he continued touring with Roger Waters' Dark Side of the Moon Tour. Later that year he was on the road with his own \"Sweet Soulful Music\" tour, performing at venues such as the Stables in Wavendon, The Ferry in Glasgow and the Library Theatre, Darwen, Lancashire. In May 2008, Fairweather Low & the Lowriders started a UK tour, the Lowriders being Paul Beavis, Dave Bronze and Richard Dunn. In 2009, he joined Eric Clapton's band for a series of 11 concerts held at the London's Royal Albert Hall. He became part of Clapton's touring band with drummer Steve Gadd and keyboardist Tim Carmon throughout May 2009. In 2011, Fairweather Low joined Clapton for another series of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. He also performs with Edie Brickell, Steve Gadd, and bassist (and fellow Welshman) Pino Palladino as The Gaddabouts; their eponymous album was released in early 2011, and their second album, \"Look Out Now!\", was released in 2012. Also in 2011, Fairweather Low made a guest appearance on Kate Bush's album \"50 Words For Snow\", singing on the chorus of the album's only single, \"Wild Man\". In 2013, he opened Eric Clapton's shows with his band the Lowriders on Clapton's European tour and, later that year, Fairweather Low & the Lowriders released the album, \"Zone-O-Tone\". In April 2013, he appeared at the Eric Clapton Guitar Festival Crossroads in New York and featured on two tracks of the DVD of the concert. On 13–14 November, he was also part of Eric Clapton's band on the occasion of Clapton's two concerts during the \"Baloises Sessions\" in Basel, Switzerland, where he was featured singing \"Gin House Blues\". In November 2015, Fairweather Low made a guest appearance on Kevin Brown's album \"Grit\".", "Fair Weather\nFair Weather Fair Weather was a British rock band formed in 1970 by former Amen Corner guitarist and vocalist, Andy Fairweather Low. They are best known for their track, \"Natural Sinner\". The band evolved from a split within Amen Corner. While saxophone player Allan Jones went on to form Judas Jump, Fairweather Low led Dennis Byron (drums), Blue Weaver (organ), Clive Taylor (bass) and Neil Jones (guitar) into the new band, Fair Weather. The band scored a UK Singles Chart Number 6 hit with \"Natural Sinner\" in 1970 and recorded one album, \"Beginning From An End\". From the latter were drawn three more singles, \"Lay It On Me\"/\"Looking for the Red Label Pt. 2\", \"Tutti Frutti\"/\"Road To Freedom\" and \"Poor Man's Bum A Run\"/\"Don't Mess With Cupid\". None charted and Fair Weather disbanded in 1971. Fairweather Low went on to a successful solo career before taking up regular work with Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Roger Waters. Weaver joined Strawbs and became an in-demand session player with Mott the Hoople, Pet Shop Boys and the Bee Gees. Bryon also became the Bee Gees' drummer."], "neg": ["Low (band)\nLow (band) Low is an American indie rock group from Duluth, Minnesota, formed in 1993. As of 2010, the group is composed of founding members Alan Sparhawk (guitar and vocals) and Mimi Parker (drums and vocals), joined by Steve Garrington (bass guitar). Previous bassists for the band include John Nichols from 1993 to 1994; Zak Sally from 1994 to 2005 and Matt Livingston from 2005 to 2008. The music of Low is characterized by slow tempos and minimalist arrangements. Early descriptions sometimes referred to it as a rock subgenre called \"slowcore\" often compared to the band Bedhead, who played this style during the 1980s and early 1990s. However, Low's members ultimately disapproved of the term. Parker and Sparhawk's striking vocal harmonies represent perhaps the group's most distinctive element; critic Denise Sullivan writes that their shared vocals are \"as chilling as anything Gram and Emmylou ever conspired on—though that's not to say it's country-tinged, just straight from the heart.\" The band formed in the spring of 1993. Sparhawk had been playing in the Superior, Wisconsin band Zen Identity, the core of which was formed by drummer Robb Berry and vocalist Bill Walton. That band needed a new bassist and recruited future Low bassist John Nichols. At that time, Nichols was a senior at Superior Senior High School, and bassist in the band Lorenzo's Tractor. Sparhawk taught Zen Identity songs to Nichols and during practices, the two started improvising with some very modest, quiet themes. As a joke, they wondered what would happen if they played such quiet music in front of Duluth crowds, which at that point focused around the loud, grunge, \"post-punk\" sound. Soon, the joke became a serious thought. Sparhawk left Zen Identity, who continued to perform and record without him, and he and Nichols recruited Sparhawk's wife Mimi Parker to play a very modest drum kit composed of a single snare drum, single cymbal, and a single floor tom. She was to use brushes almost exclusively rather than drum sticks. Low's debut album, \"I Could Live in Hope\", was released on Virgin Records' Vernon Yard imprint in 1994. It featured Nichols on bass, though he was replaced by Zak Sally, who joined for the recording of the band's next album \"Long Division\". Both \"I Could Live in Hope\" and \"Long Division\" were produced and recorded by Kramer. \"Long Division\" and its similar follow-up, 1996's \"The Curtain Hits the Cast\", established the band as critical darlings; extensive touring helped them to develop a highly devoted fan base. \"Over the Ocean,\" a single drawn from \"The Curtain Hits the Cast\", also became something of a hit on college radio. By the time of their next full-length album (1999's \"Secret Name\") Low had moved to the independent label Kranky. In between, they released several singles and EPs. In 1999, Low joined forces with Dirty Three to record an In The Fishtank session for Konkurrent records. Allmusic called the six-song disc \"some of the best material either unit has produced.\" Of particular note is the disc's lengthy cover of Neil Young's \"Down by the River.\" 2001 saw the release of \"Things We Lost in the Fire\". The following year saw the release of the band's final full-length on Kranky, \"Trust\". All three of the band's full-length releases on Kranky featured superstar producers: \"Secret Name\" and \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" feature the work of recording engineer Steve Albini, who proved sympathetic to capturing the band's strengths; while \"Trust\" was recorded by Tom Herbers along with Duluth engineer Eric Swanson and mixed by Tchad Blake at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios. In April 2003, Peter S. Scholtes of the Twin Cities weekly paper \"City Pages\" posted in his weblog that Sally had left Low. The following month, the band posted an update to the news on their website: \"We have all had to work through some personal things recently ... After sorting it out, the good news is that Zak is remaining in the band ...\" In July 2003, they toured Europe with Radiohead, Sally in tow. Following a successful tour in early 2004 that vividly demonstrated the band's commitment to their fans (Parker was visibly pregnant throughout), the band signaled their intent to continue making music by signing with powerhouse indie label Sub Pop. To tie up the loose ends of the era, Low released a three-disc rarities compilation on its own Chairkickers label in 2004. Beginning with \"Secret Name\", the band have diversified their sound. The band use subtle electronic music touches to augment their sound, reflective of their tenure with Kranky and their exposure to the Midwest's post-rock scene. Adding a more overt rock element to their aesthetic, the band has used fuzz bass from \"Things We Lost In the Fire\" onward, and began using distorted lead guitar on \"Trust\". The band's 2005 album, \"The Great Destroyer\", nods even further in the direction of rock. Recorded with producer Dave Fridmann and released by Sub Pop in January 2005, \"The Great Destroyer\" has received mostly positive reviews; the Village Voice described the record's \"comparatively thunderous verve.\" Low canceled the second leg of their extensive tour in support of \"The Great Destroyer\" in late spring of 2005. Sparhawk's statement, published on the band's website, addressed directly to fans, detailing his personal problems with depression resulting in the cancellation of the tour. In August 2005, Sparhawk announced his return to performance, embarking on a US tour with former Red House Painters frontman Mark Kozelek. In October 2005, Sally announced he was leaving the band. Low replaced Sally with Matt Livingston, a bassist and saxophonist from Duluth's musical scene. In addition to playing bass guitar, Livingston also played an antique Navy chaplain's pump organ in the group. After appearing on 2007's \"Drums and Guns\" and touring with the group, Matt Livingston left Low in 2008, to be replaced by Steve Garrington. Low are known for their impressive live performances. Rock club audiences sometimes watch the band while seated on the floor. During their early career, the band often faced unsympathetic and inattentive audiences in bars and clubs, to which they responded by bucking rock protocol and turning their volume \"down\". The huge dynamic range of Low's early music made it susceptible to background noise and chatter, since many of their songs were very quiet. A performance in 1996 at the South by Southwest festival was overpowered when a Scandinavian hardcore band was booked downstairs. The \"Trust\" album marked a turning point, and Low's music has developed a more emphatic sound. Their shows often feature drastically reinterpreted cover versions of famous songs by Joy Division and The Smiths, in addition to their own original material. In performance, Low shows off a sense of humor not necessarily found on their recordings; a tour in early 2004 featured a cover of OutKast's hit song \"Hey Ya!.\" At a gig in Los Angeles on Halloween 1998, the band took the stage as a Misfits tribute act, complete with corpse paint and black clothing. At the 2008 End of the Road festival in Dorset, England, Sparhawk abruptly ended the band's performance by ripping the strings and lead out of his guitar, throwing it to the ground and then hurling it into the crowd before exiting the stage. He had earlier informed the audience that it had been a \"crappy day\". In 2010 they performed the Great Destroyer at Primavera Sound Festival On Friday July 13, 2012 Low gave a candlelit concert at Halifax Minster. Low's performance at the 2013 Rock the Garden concert consisted of a slowed and lengthened version of their drone rock song \"Do You Know How to Waltz?\" followed by Alan saying, \"Drone, not drones,\" a reference to an anti-drone sticker made by Minneapolis's Luke Heiken; the performance resulted in mass audience confusion and divisive online discussion. The performance lasted half an hour and was broadcast live on The Current which had been playing cuts of their recent album. Low had performed a more traditional show for The Current at the Fitzgerald earlier in the year. The band's mainstream exposure has been limited: their best-known song is arguably a hymnal version of \"The Little Drummer Boy,\" which was featured in a Gap television ad that depicted a snowball fight in slow-motion to match the song's glacial tempo. A remix of their \"Halflight\" was featured in the \"Mothman Prophecies\" motion picture. The band made their network television debut in 2005 by performing the single \"California\" on an episode of Last Call with Carson Daly. On June 11, 2007, Scott Bateman, a web animator, announced that his video for Low's song \"Hatchet (Optimimi version)\" would be one of the preloads on the new Zune. Also in 2007 they recorded a song called \"Family Tree\" which featured in the \"Careful\" episode of Nick Jr's kids' show \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\" On March 24, 2008, their song \"Point of Disgust\" was featured in the popular show \"Skins\" in the UK, prompting a rush of download sales from iTunes. Another of their songs, \"Sunflower,\" was featured in the following episode (episode 9), and \"Breaker\" was featured in a later episode. As the music supervisor of \"Skins\" declared in the Episode Track Listing section of the show's official website: \"You may have guessed by now that we are all pretty huge fans of Low in the Skins office[...]\" The 2008 movie \"KillShot\", starring Mickey Rourke and Diane Lane features the song \"Monkey\" early in the film. The 2003 documentary film \"Tarnation\" by Jonathan Caouette features the Low tracks \"Laser Beam\", \"Embrace\" and \"Back Home Again\" alongside tracks by artists such as Red House Painters and The Magnetic Fields. \"Laser Beam\" also featured on episode 4 season 2 of Misfits. Low was the subject of the 2008 documentary \"Low: You May Need a Murderer\". In 2010, Robert Plant recorded two Low songs that were included on his album \"Band of Joy\". The two songs in question were \"Monkey\" and \"Silver Rider\" from the LP \"The Great Destroyer\". In an interview, Plant said of Low's \"The Great Destroyer\", \"It's great music; it's always been in the house playing away beside Jerry Lee Lewis and Howlin' Wolf, you know. There's room for everything.\". It is rumored that Plant was introduced to Low's music by guitarist/producer Buddy Miller who has worked with both Plant as well as Low in the past, including playing guitar on \"Band of Joy\". Curiously, writing credits for both \"Monkey\" and \"Silver Rider\" are listed in the \"Band of Joy\" liner notes as \"Zachary Micheletti, Mimi Parker, George Sparhawk\" per the official listing in BMI's publishing database. It is notable that Sparhawk performs under the pseudonym \"Chicken-Bone George\" in his side project Black Eyed Snakes. The band were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England. In November 2013, their song \"Blue Christmas\" featured as part of the soundtrack to season 4, episode 7 (\"Chapter 28\") of HBO's \"Eastbound & Down\". In June 2017, the song \"Especially Me\" featured in season 5, episode 8 (\"Tied to the Tracks\") of Netflix's Orange is The New Black. Sparhawk and Parker are married, have two children, and are practicing members of the Mormon faith. (Sparhawk was born into an LDS family in Seattle, and for some time lived in Utah before moving to Minnesota at age nine; he also briefly attended Brigham Young University. Parker is a convert.) In 2006, Sparhawk was involved in raising funds for the construction of a school in Namuncha, Kenya, which he visited in August of that year. On Low's website he is quoted as saying, \"My visit to Namuncha, Kenya in August was one of the most impressive experiences of my life so far.\" Low owns a record label, Chairkickers' Union, which releases material by other musicians such as Rivulets and Haley Bonar, as well as some of their own material. Sparhawk is notably active in Duluth's small but vibrant independent music scene; he operates a recording studio in the town, in a deconsecrated church that naturally provides the lush reverb characteristic of Low's sound. The Chairkickers label offers another outlet for Duluth musicians, as most groups on the label are from that city, or at least from Minnesota and surrounding areas. Sally has toured as a bassist with Dirty Three, and Sparhawk has devoted considerable time and energy to his Black Eyed Snakes project, a blues-rock revival band quite far removed from the Low aesthetic. Recently Sparhawk has also been seen with a new side project called The Retribution Gospel Choir. Matt Livingston, who became Low's bassist in late 2005, also played in The Retribution Gospel Choir, and was subsequently replaced by Steve Garrington. On Retribution's first tour (fall 2005), they played the Low song \"From Your Place on Sunset.\" Musical crossover between Sparhawk's bands went in both directions as two songs originally released on a RGC tour EP, \"Hatchet\" and \"Breaker\", were later covered on Low's Drums and Guns release (before making it onto RGC's self-titled full-length debut). Similarly, Low and the Black-Eyed Snakes have played some overlapping songs, such as \"Lordy\". Sparhawk and Sally also made several recordings in a more synthesizer-driven style, reminiscent of the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, under the name The Hospital People. The most widely distributed of these was \"Crash / We'll Be Philosophers\", released as a 7-inch on clear vinyl by Duck Suit Records. Sparhawk and Sally have also played live as The Tooth Fairies, with Sally performing on drums and Sean Erspamer on bass; Tooth Fairies sets have typically consisted of cover songs by the Stooges, MC5, and similar bands. Sally has generated several works that fall in the 'graphic novel' genre, and also created the original artwork for David Bazan's (formerly of Pedro the Lion) first solo effort, the EP Fewer Moving Parts, which was recently re-released by Barsuk. At one time, Mimi Parker was rumored to have started a punk band called Rubbersnake, but this was an inside joke on the part of the band. In 2007 Sparhawk did a \"Take-Away Show\" acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. In April 2012, Low collaborated with artist Peter Liversidge for their performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Low collaborated with the artist again for their performance at the Barbican Centre in London in April 2013. In 2011, Sparhawk began collaborating with fellow Duluth violinist/vocalist Gaelynn Lea on a band called The Murder of Crows. The duo  plays Lea's originals, instrumentals, and covers, using looping pedals and pared-down arrangements that create a haunting sound."]}
{"query": "Sackett family origins and historical basis instead of fictional westward expansion in Louis L'Amour novels", "pos": ["Sackett\nSackett The Sackett family is a fictional American family featured in a number of western novels, short stories and historical novels by American writer Louis L'Amour. The novels trace much of the history of the family through individual members of the family as they move across the Atlantic from England, settle in the Appalachians, and then move west to the Great Plains, the Rockies, and California. Unlike novels by such writers as James A. Michener, these stories do not trace the rise and fall of the fortunes of a clan or extended family, but simply tie together significant and minor characters in several of the Western novels. L'Amour's Sackett family originates in The Fens of Cambridgeshire in East Anglia. The patriarch of the family, Barnabas Sackett, becomes a merchant captain and eventually settles with his wife Abigail (née Tempany) in what will become the borderlands of North Carolina and Tennessee. The family quickly divides into three clans, sired by several of their sons: the \"Smoky Mountain Sacketts\", \"Cumberland Gap Sacketts\", and \"Clinch Mountain Sacketts\". There are also Flatland Sacketts, but are rarely touched upon in the novels. It is the Smoky Mountain Sacketts that produce some of L'Amour's most memorable and beloved characters, including William Tell \"Tell\" Sackett and his brothers Tyrel and Orrin, of the novel \"Sackett\" (see below) and others. Orrin was a Sheriff, legislator and eventually senator. Tyrel became a respected rancher and lawman, often simply known as the \"Mora Gunfighter\" after the town he settled in. The main theme that runs through most of the Sackett books is that of loyalty to the family and helping the family when beset by foes. \"When you step on the toes of one Sackett, they all come running.\" The deadly Sackett-Higgins feud in Tennessee lasted years. As Tell Sackett notes in the book \"The Sackett Brand\", \"The last feud my family taken part in lasted seventy years. The last Higgins died with his gun in his hand, but he died.\"  The Clinch Mountain boys tend to be rougher. The twins, Nolan and Logan have hired out their guns, held up a stage or two, but are decent men. Logan came to the aid of Emily Talon, herself a Sackett by birth, in Colorado. Two other families whose members L'Amour wrote about, and whose families have rubbed shoulders at different times over the three centuries his novels cover, are the Chantry and Talon families, with Borden Chantry and Milo Talon being contemporaries of Tell Sackett. This is the third of the Sackett novels and published in 1961 (\"Daybreakers\" was the first, published in 1960, though it is not the first chronologically). It tells the story of William Tell Sackett, a Union Army veteran who makes his way West in the years following the War, hoping to settle down at the right place as a rancher. He is the main character in several other Sackett books including \"Mojave Crossing\", \"The Lonely Men\", \"Treasure Mountain\", and \"The Sackett Brand\", among others. He is the brother of Tyrel and Orrin Sackett, who went west to New Mexico circa 1870-1872. Tell is also the 'ugly duckling' (by his own admission) of the family. However, he does meet a beautiful woman named Ange Kerry in \"Sackett\" and falls in love. He loses her when she is brutally murdered in \"The Sackett Brand.\". He meets another lady in \"Treasure Mountain\", and presumably marries her. L'Amour has left the ending to the imagination of the reader in this novel. L'Amour confirmed to Dr. John Sackett that he found the name on Sackett's Well in a place west of Yuma. The desert watering hole was named for cavalry Lt. Delos B. Sackett who was an Indian fighter in the region before the Civil War. L'Amour has used names and places that roughly parallel a real branch of the Sackett Family, but the accounts are fictional. This non-fiction book, published in 1988 a few months after Louis L'Amour's death, is his personal guide to the Sackett novels, with long lists of characters, locations, ships, weapons, and summaries of each of the novels. \"Sackett's Land\", published in 1974, is the first novel chronologically of the Sackett novels, taking place around AD 1600 in England (including The Fens and Queen Elizabeth I's London), on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Atlantic Seaboard of North America, particularly in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras. The main character and narrator is Barnabas Sackett, son of mercenary and freeholder Ivo Sackett. The Sacketts was a two-part TV movie broadcast on May 15 & 16, 1979, based on the novels \"The Daybreakers\" and \"Sackett\". It starred Sam Elliott as Tell Sackett, Tom Selleck as Orrin, and Jeff Osterhage as Tyrel, but also featured parts for Western movie veterans, including Glenn Ford, Gilbert Roland, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Pat Buttram, Ben Johnson, and Mercedes McCambridge (as \"Ma Sackett\"). It was later released in a cut-down version as \"The Daybreakers\". Barnabas Sackett – The founding member of the Sackett clan. Travels to the New World to escape the warrant of the Queen. Killed by Seneca Indians. Son of Ivo Sackett, soldier and war hero. Kin-Ring Sackett – First son of Barnabas Sackett, born on a buffalo robe in the heat of battle. First Sackett born in the New World. Married Diana Macklin from Cape Ann. Brian Sackett – Second son of Barnabas Sackett. Leaves America with his mother and sister to study law in England Yance Sackett – Third son of Barnabas Sackett. Best known for his quick temper and strength and willingness of action. Founder of Clinch Mountain Branch of Sacketts. Married a girl named Temperance Penney from Cape Ann. Jublain Sackett (Jubal) – Fourth son of Barnabas Sackett. He was the first Sackett to cross the mountains and see the plains. Known as the quiet one, he is a ghost in the woods. Spends much time away from home and eventually quits the hills of North Carolina for the Rocky Mountains. Marries Itchakomi Ishaia, a \"Sun\" of the Natchee. Echo Sackett – Only female member of the Sackett clan to narrate a story. Aunt of Tell, Orrin and Tyrel. Logan Sackett – Twin brother of Nolan Sackett. Comes from the Clinch Mountain branch of Sacketts and lives up to their reputation. Rough, two-fisted, a man \"with the bark on\", and with a deserved reputation as being fast with a gun and hell-on wheels in any kind of fight, he has ridden the Owlhoot Trail and admits to skirting the dark side of the law on more than one occasion. A lot rougher than Orrin or Tyrel, he is nonetheless a generally decent man. Comes to the aid of his aunt, Emily Talon. Nolan Sackett – Twin Brother of Logan Sackett. Comes from the Clinch Mountain Branch of Sacketts. Like his brother, he has ridden the outlaw trail. Rough and dangerous, with a hefty reputation as a very bad man to fool around with, he has a strong sense of right and wrong. Wears three pistols, two tied down and one in his coat. Orlando Sackett (\"Lando\") – Son of Falcon Sackett. One of the last Sacketts to move west. Spends six years in a Mexican prison. Becomes a well-known fist-fighter and boxer. Falcon Sackett – Father of Orlando Sackett. Formerly captain of a ship. Finds a lost treasure of great value and spends several years in a Mexican prison before finally escaping and being rescued by his son. Flagan Sackett – Brother of Galloway Sackett. One of the younger Sacketts. Has a strong will to survive. Rarely found far from his brother. Galloway Sackett – Brother of Flagan Sackett. Tall and handsome, nearly fearless in the face of danger. Known to brave danger and live. Parmalee Sackett – A \"flatland Sackett\", Parmalee's family moved down to the richer flatlands while the majority of the clan stayed in the mountains. His affluent lifestyle has not made him weak, as men who have braced him could testify – if they were still above ground. The three main and most well known characters are the three brothers, sons of Colburn Sackett; Tell, Orrin, and Tyrel. Their father liked his horses fast, his drinks hard, and his preachers Hellfire hot, and raised his three sons accordingly. Although they often go long periods without seeing one another, they're completely devoted to one another, and come to each other's aid any time needed, dropping all else that they might be involved in at the time, true to the one binding rule in their lives: \"When you hunt one Sackett, you hunt 'em all\". William Tell Sackett (\"Tell\") – Oldest son of Colburn Sackett (\"Ride the Dark Trail\" section of \"The Sackett Companion\"). Fought for the Union in the Civil War. A hard, tough, quiet man who wants only to be left alone, it takes very little to anger Tell, and he will fight like a rabid wolf if pushed, as several men have found out – usually, it's the last mistake they make. He's a loner, at home in the High Lonesome, often going years without seeing or communicating with his family back in Tennessee. He takes any job that suits him at the moment, from cowhand to miner, and drifts, rarely staying in one place any great length of time. He's killed several men in his lifetime, is fast and deadly accurate with any kind of gun, as well as the Tinker-made knife he carries. Although outwardly he appears rough, he has a sound, strong moral character, never forgetting his father's rule of \"...always ride on the side of the law, never against it\". In the film adaptations he is portrayed by Sam Elliott. Orrin Sackett – Second son of Colburn Sackett. Orrin likes people and tries to see the best of them. Handsome, witty, and smart, he likes to believe that most people like him, however he can be a bit naive at times. Good with a gun, and always ready with a smile and a quote, he's strong willed and completely devoted to his family. He is calm during a fight, never getting excited or losing his head, a trait that is in all three brothers. Married twice, he killed a member of the Higgins family during a gunfight, only to have Long Higgens come after him on his wedding day. Orrin was unarmed, and his new wife jumped in front of him as Higgins fired, killing her. Orrin's brother Tyrel killed Higgins, then left Tennessee to avoid further problems. Orrin left soon after, promising his mother they'd send for her. He then married the treacherous Laura Pritts who tried to use him as part of her bigoted father's land grab in Santa Fe against the settled Mexican landowners. Later after she is exposed as a fraud she attempts to lure William Tell into Apache country to rescue her nonexistent son with Orrin, a plan which fails. Always honest and straightforward, the fights that Orrin usually finds himself a part of are generally started by his steadfast and unwavering stance on something he believes strongly in. A smooth talker, Orrin has no problem making friends, especially of the female persuasion. He later was elected sheriff of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where his reputation as a man fair to all ethnicities, Hispanic and Anglo alike, gained him respect. In one of the novels, Orrin's ex-wife Laura Pritts has sent men to kill him. As one of his brothers relates it, \"Seems like they'd been told they were hunting a lawyer. Well, there's lawyers and there's lawyers, just like there was a dentist named Doc Holliday.\" The man died. In the film adaptations he is portrayed by Tom Selleck. Tyrel Sackett – Third son of Colburn Sackett. He idolizes his brothers Tell and Orrin. Known throughout the West as the Mora Gunfighter, and by his brothers as the \"mean one\" or the \"black sheep\", Tyrel is the fastest with a gun of the three brothers. He always thinks things through, never acting prior to planning things out. Wherever Tyrel goes, he seems to attract trouble, and sooner or later someone always tries to outdraw him, but never succeeds – by his own admission: \"Till the day I hung 'em up, I was the fastest gun alive.\" And he's left enough bodies behind him to prove it. Compassionate to a fault, his sense of morals never leave him, and stands as a steady guide on his way west. In Santa Fe he is forced to kill Tom Sunday, a close friend who'd gone bad after losing what he saw as his last chance to start a new life, which affects him deeply. Naive where women are concerned, he often seems like a shy schoolboy when facing a pretty girl. He becomes involved with and marries Drusilla Alvarado, the beautiful granddaughter of a rich Spanish don. In the film adaptations he is portrayed by Jeff Osterhage. The 1982 made for TV movie \"The Shadow Riders\" was based upon another Louis L'Amour novel and stars Sam Elliott (Dal Traven), Tom Selleck (Mac Traven), and Jeff Osterhage (Jesse Traven) in similar roles to those they play in \"The Sacketts\". However, neither the novel nor the movie are connected with the Sackett Saga. The movie was made primarily to capitalize on the success of \"The Sacketts\". All the Sackett novels are told from the first-person perspective with some stories having a paragraph or two told through a third-person perspective. The following list is of all 18 novels that were completed during Mr. L'Amour's lifetime. The name that is adjoined to each title tells through whose perspective the story is told. Other Sackett novels are frequently mentioned through passing and other Sackett characters are also mentioned in several of the novels.", "Sackett (surname)\nSackett (surname) Sackett (occasionally Sacket) is an English surname originating in the Isle of Thanet, Kent, probably at Sackett's Hill in the parish of St Peter in Thanet (now Broadstairs and St Peter's). The earliest record of the name dates from 1317 when William Saket of Southborough, St Peter in Thanet, was in a legal dispute with the Abbot of St Augustine, Canterbury. The Sacketts were among the first colonists of America, with Simon Sackett arriving at the Massachusetts Bay Colony a few months after the Winthrop Fleet of 1630, and John Sackett, possibly a nephew of Simon, arriving at the New Haven Colony sometime before 1641. Early variants were Sakt and Saket. Later records are of Sacket, Sackett, Sackette. The only extant forms are Sacket and Sackett, with Sackett predominating. Several derivations of the surname Sackett have been proposed: The word \"sacket\" has two dictionary definitions: a bag; and a term of reproach or abuse. None of these possible derivations of the surname is likely. Any would have resulted in the name arising independently in different places; but such is the concentration of the name in early records in a small area of Thanet that it may be supposed that the name originated in a single family. Certainly, the surname, first found in 1317, is seen to predate the earliest recorded use (c1440) of the word \"sakett\" meaning a bag.  Although the name originated in England, there are now many more Sacketts in the United States. The great majority of these are in the line of Simon Sackett the colonist (1595–1635). Sacketts in the UK number just under 500, giving a frequency of 9 per million, and a surname ranking of 11,423. There are about 5,500 Sacketts in the USA, a frequency of 20 per million, and a ranking of 5,759. Australia has about 70 residents with the name, which is ranked 19,192, with a frequency of 4 per million.  The author Louis L'Amour chose the name Sackett for the central characters in a series of novels after finding Sackett's Well in California.", "The Sacketts\nThe Sacketts The Sacketts is a 1979 American made-for-television Western film directed by Robert Totten and starring Sam Elliott, Tom Selleck, Jeff Osterhage, and Glenn Ford. Based on the novels \"The Daybreakers\" and \"Sackett\" by Louis L'Amour, the film recounts the story of the Sackett brothers in 1869 who leave their Tennessee home and start a new life together in Santa Fe. Three brothers from Tennessee, the sons of Welsh immigrants, named Tell Sackett, Orrin Sackett, and Tyrel Sackett, respectively, are brought together by the tragic events that occur at Orrin's wedding. Tell (Sam Elliott) is a mountain man who hasn't seen his family in almost ten years, Orrin (Tom Selleck) is a former lawman now looking to settle down with his family, and Tyrel (Jeff Osterhage) is the youngest brother who is very good with a revolver. At the wedding, Long Higgins (James O'Connell), the brother of a man Orrin had previously killed arrives in the middle of the ceremony and holds Orrin at gunpoint. Long pulls the trigger, but Orrin's fiancée gets in the way and is shot and killed. Tyrel arrives and shoots Long dead. Having killed a man, Tyrel clears out of Tennessee and heads west. Following the funeral of Orrin's fiancée, his mother tells him to join Tyrel and find Tell, and to go start a life in the west. Meanwhile, Tell has found work in a mining camp in Uvalde, Texas. During a card game, Tell accuses one of the men, Wes Bigelow, of cheating and shoots him dead. The leader of the mining camp suggests that Tell should leave before the victim's brothers arrive to seek revenge, and Tell heads out alone into the wilderness. On his way west, Tyrel meets with a cattle drive and signs on as a cowhand. He immediately becomes friends with aging cowhand Cap Rountree (Ben Johnson), and former gunfighter Tom Sunday (Glenn Ford), who becomes a mentor to Tyrel. Orrin catches up with the group and joins them. As they finish the drive in Abilene, Kansas, Cap, Tom, Orrin and Tyrel make plans to collect wild cattle near the Purgatoire River. While in the town, Orrin becomes attracted to the daughter of wealthy man Jonathan Pritts (John Vernon), while Tyrel becomes attracted to the Drusilla (Ana Alicia), the granddaughter of wealthy Mexican Don Luis (Gilbert Roland). Don Luis and Pritts are arguing with each other over Luis' land in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Orrin and Tyrel eventually meet up with Tell in a small town in Colorado called Purgatorie. Cap and Tell decide to go searching for gold up in the mountains, while Orrin, Tyrel and Sunday continue with their plan to collect wild cattle on the way to Santa Fe. Soon after they leave, Ira Bigelow (Jack Elam) arrives in town and declares that he is tracking Tell Sackett with the aim of killing him. In Elizabethtown, New Mexico, Tell and Cap are confronted by a young gunfighter named Kid Newton. Tell avoids a gunbattle with Newton by talking him down and ordering him to leave. When Ira Bigelow's search for Tell brings him to Elizabethtown, Newton offers to be his guide. Just before reaching Santa Fe, Sunday, Orrin, and Tyrel come across the corpses of a family killed by Indians. Upon finding a safe-box containing $1,000, Orrin and Sunday disagree over what to do with the money. Sunday wanting to split the money between the three of them, Orrin wanting to send the money to a relative of those killed, mentioned in a letter found near one of the bodies. Upon reaching Santa Fe, when it becomes clear that Sunday has no intentions of returning the money, the relationship between him and Orrin slowly disintegrates, with Tyrel caught in the middle (though mostly siding with his brother.) Meanwhile. while searching for gold in the mountains, Cap and Tell find a lost woman, Ange Kerry (Wendy Rastatter). Ira Bigelow, his brother Jack (Slim Pickens) and their hired men soon arrive and eventually assault Tell's camp, wounding Cap in the leg, and trapping the three of them in the caves, where they hide out. Both Orrin and Sunday run in the election for town sheriff. Pritts, knowing that if Sunday wins, he will side with Don Luis and the Mexicans, helps Orrin win the election by disclosing that Sunday is a disbarred lawyer and ex-convict from Louisiana. Humiliated, Sunday starts drinking heavily and becomes increasingly hostile towards Orrin. Orrin asks Sunday to be his deputy, but Sunday blames Orrin for ruining his dream of a fresh start in Santa Fe, and accuses him of being bought by Pritts. Sunday angrily refuses the offer, and even slaps Orrin in the face when Orrin calls him a liar. Don Luis soon dies of old age. Orrin and Tyrel, now appointed as deputy sheriff, prove that Pritts has been attempting to run the Mexicans out of Santa Fe and send him to jail. Orrin decides to run for mayor if Tyrel stays as sheriff. As Orrin is announcing his intention to the townspeople in the plaza, Sunday arrives seeking a final confrontation with Orrin. Tyrel sees him first and stands in his way. When Tyrel refuses to move, Sunday draws his gun. Tyrel draws and shoots Sunday first. Tyrel weeps as Sunday dies in his arms. Still trapped in the caves, and with Cap unable to go far due to his wounded leg, Ange escapes on a stolen horse and wires a message for help to Orrin, while Tell and Cap (when his leg is strong enough) escape back to Purgatorie on foot. The Bigelows and their men catch up to them in town and challenge Tell to a gunfight the next day at daybreak. Orrin and Tyrel receive Ange's telegram and rush to join Tell at Purgatorie. The following day Tell strides out onto the street alone to face the Bigelow gang, now including the last Bigelow brother, Benson (Gene Evans). Unbeknownst to Tell, Cap grabs a shotgun and hobbles after him. Tell finds Orrin and Tyrel waiting for him in the street. As the Bigelows and their men start to emerge from the livery stable, the Sacketts open fire and the gun battle begins. With the help of Cap, the Sacketts kill all seven of the Bigelow gang. Cap joins the reunited Sackett brothers as they walk away down the street.", "Louis L'Amour\nLouis L'Amour Louis Dearborn L'Amour (; March 22, 1908 – June 10, 1988) was an American novelist and short-story writer. His books consisted primarily of Western novels (though he called his work \"frontier stories\"); however, he also wrote historical fiction (\"The Walking Drum\"), science fiction (\"Haunted Mesa\"), non-fiction (\"Frontier\"), as well as poetry and short-story collections. Many of his stories were made into films. L'Amour's books remain popular and most have gone through multiple printings. At the time of his death almost all of his 105 existing works (89 novels, 14 short-story collections, and two full-length works of nonfiction) were still in print, and he was \"one of the world's most popular writers\". Louis Dearborn LaMoore was born in Jamestown, North Dakota, in 1908, the seventh child of Dr. Louis Charles LaMoore and Emily Dearborn LaMoore. He was of French ancestry through his father and Irish through his mother. Dr. LaMoore was a large-animal veterinarian, local politician and farm-equipment broker who had arrived in Dakota Territory in 1882. Although the area around Jamestown was mostly farm land, cowboys and livestock often traveled through Jamestown on their way to or from ranches in Montana and the markets to the east. L'Amour played \"Cowboys and Indians\" in the family barn, which served as his father's veterinary hospital, and spent much of his free time at the local library, the Alfred E. Dickey Free Library, reading, particularly G. A. Henty, a British author of historical boys' novels during the late nineteenth century. L'Amour once said, \"[Henty's works] enabled me to go into school with a great deal of knowledge that even my teachers didn't have about wars and politics.\" After a series of bank failures devastated the economy of the upper Midwest, Dr. LaMoore and Emily took to the road. Removing Louis and his adopted brother John from school, they headed south in the winter of 1923. Over the next seven or eight years, they skinned cattle in west Texas, baled hay in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico, worked in the mines of Arizona, California and Nevada, and in the saw mills and lumber camps of the Pacific Northwest. It was in colorful places like these that Louis met a wide variety of people, upon whom he later modeled the characters in his novels, many of them actual Old West personalities who had survived into the nineteen-twenties and -thirties. Making his way as a mine assessment worker, professional boxer and merchant seaman, Louis traveled the country and the world, sometimes with his family, sometimes not. He visited all of the western states plus England, Japan, China, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, Arabia, Egypt, and Panama, finally moving with his parents to Choctaw, Oklahoma in the early 1930s. There, he changed his name to Louis L'Amour and settled down to try to make something of himself as a writer. He had success with poetry, articles on boxing and writing and editing sections of the WPA Guide Book to Oklahoma, but the dozens of short stories he was churning out met with little acceptance. Finally, L'Amour placed a story, \"Death Westbound\", in \"10 Story Book\", a magazine that featured what was supposed to be quality writing (Jack Woodford, author of several books on writing, is published in the same edition as L'Amour) alongside scantily attired, or completely naked young women. Several years later, L'Amour placed his first story for pay, \"Anything for a Pal\", published in \"True Gang Life\". Two lean disappointing years passed after that, and then, in 1938, his stories began appearing in pulp magazines fairly regularly. Along with other adventure and crime stories, L'Amour created the character of mercenary sea captain Jim Mayo. Starting with \"East of Gorontalo\", the series ran through nine episodes from 1940 until 1943. L'Amour wrote only one story in the western genre prior to World War II, 1940's \"The Town No Guns Could Tame\". L'Amour continued as an itinerant worker, traveling the world as a merchant seaman until the start of World War II. During World War II, he served in the United States Army as a lieutenant with the 362nd Quartermaster Truck Company. In the two years before L'Amour was shipped off to Europe, L'Amour wrote stories for \"Standard Magazine\". After World War II, L'Amour continued to write stories for magazines; his first after being discharged in 1946 was \"Law of the Desert Born\" in \"Dime Western Magazine\" (April 1946). L'Amour's contact with Leo Margulies led to L'Amour agreeing to write many stories for the Western pulp magazines published by Standard Magazines, a substantial portion of which appeared under the name \"Jim Mayo\". The suggestion of L'Amour writing Hopalong Cassidy novels also was made by Margulies who planned on launching \"Hopalong Cassidy's Western Magazine\" at a time when the William Boyd films and new television series were becoming popular with a new generation. L'Amour read the original Hopalong Cassidy novels, written by Clarence E. Mulford, and wrote his novels based on the original character under the name \"Tex Burns\". Only two issues of the \"Hopalong Cassidy Western Magazine\" were published, and the novels as written by L'Amour were extensively edited to meet Doubleday's thoughts of how the character should be portrayed in print. In the 1950s, L'Amour began to sell novels. L'Amour's first novel, published under his own name, was \"Westward The Tide\", published by World's Work in 1951. The short story, \"The Gift of Cochise\" was printed in Colliers (5 July 1952) and seen by John Wayne and Robert Fellows, who purchased the screen rights from L'Amour for $4,000. James Edward Grant was hired to write a screenplay based on this story changing the main character's name from Ches Lane to Hondo Lane. L'Amour retained the right to novelize the screenplay and did so, even though the screenplay differed substantially from the original story. This was published as \"Hondo\" in 1953 and released on the same day the film opened with a blurb from John Wayne stating that \"\"Hondo\" was the finest Western Wayne had ever read\". During the remainder of the decade L'Amour produced a great number of novels, both under his own name as well as others (e. g. Jim Mayo). Also during this time he rewrote and expanded many of his earlier short story and pulp fiction stories to book length for various publishers. Many publishers in the 1950s and '60s refused to publish more than one or two books a year by the same author. Louis's editor at Gold Medal supported his writing up to three or four but the heads of the company vetoed that idea even though Louis was publishing books with other houses. Louis had sold over a dozen novels and several million copies before Bantam Books editor-in-chief Saul David was finally able to convince his company to offer Louis a short term exclusive contract that would accept three books a year. It was only after 1960, however, that Louis's sales at Bantam would begin to surpass his sales at Gold Medal. L'Amour's career flourished throughout the 1960s and he began work on a series of novels about the fictional Sackett family. Initially he wrote five books about William Tell Sackett and his close relatives; however, in later years the series spread to include other families and four centuries of North American history. It was an ambitious project and several stories intended to close the gaps in the family's time line were left untold at the time of L'Amour's death. L'Amour also branched out into historical fiction with \"The Walking Drum\", set in the 11th century, a contemporary thriller, \"Last of the Breed\", and science fiction with \"The Haunted Mesa\". L'Amour eventually wrote 100 novels, over 250 short stories, and (as of 2010) sold more than 320 million copies of his work. By the 1970s his writings were translated into over 10 languages. Every one of his works is still in print. L'Amour appears under the name of \"Lew\" as a minor character in the 2006 novel \"The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril\" by Paul Malmont. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. Many of the L'Amour titles have been produced in the \"single voice\" style. In the early days, however, when the fledgling Bantam Audio Publishing (now Random House Audio) came to L'Amour about converting some of his old short stories into audio, he insisted that they do something to offer the audience more value than just having an actor read a bunch of old pulp stories. Together he and Bantam executive Jenny Frost created the concept of a series of \"Radio Drama\" style productions that would combine a large cast of actors, sound effects and music to produce a modern audio drama of each story. The team of David Rapkin (Producer) and Charles Potter (Director) was employed to produce a prototype show and L'Amour's son Beau came into the program as Supervising Producer. Between 1986 and 2004 the team had completed over sixty-five dramatized audio productions. Several different styles of show were produced over the years. The first several shows were \"transcriptions\", literal breakdowns of the exact L'Amour short story into lines for the different characters and narrator. Later productions used more liberally interpreted adaptations written by screenwriters, playwrights and a few film and theater students, who were taught the process by Beau L'Amour and the more prolific writers from earlier adaptations. The majority of productions were done in New York City. In the early years the pace of production was six shows a year but in the mid-1990s it slowed to four. At this time the running time for all the programs was roughly sixty minutes. The cast members were veterans of the New York stage, film and advertising worlds and came together for a rehearsal and then a day of recording the show. Sound effects were created by effects man Arthur Miller in the studio as the lines were being recorded and narration was done. Although many of the programs were written and produced in a modified \"Old Time Radio\" style, attempts were also made to modernize the approach. Whenever the story material supported it a more contemporary style was used in the writing and more and more high tech solutions to the effects and mix found their way into the productions. While hiring and supervising the writers, mostly out of Los Angeles, Beau L'Amour created a few programs on his own. The techniques used by him and producer/editor Paul O'Dell were more in line with motion picture production, simply taping the voices of the actors in the studio and then recording the majority of sound effects in the field. This called for a great deal more editing, both in cutting the actor's performances and the sound effects, but it allowed for a great deal more control. In the mid-1990s a series of the L'Amour Audio Dramas was recut for radio. Louis L'Amour Theater played on over two hundred stations for a number of years. Several of the scripts from the L'Amour series have been produced as live theater pieces, including \"The One for the Mojave Kid\" and \"Merrano of the Dry Country\". The L'Amour program of Audio Dramas is still ongoing but the pace of production has slowed considerably. Beau L'Amour and Paul O'Dell released \"Son of a Wanted Man\", the first L'Amour Drama in half a decade in 2004. \"Son of a Wanted Man\" is also the first Louis L'Amour novel to be turned into a drama. Considerably more complex than earlier shows it had a cast of over twenty mid-level Hollywood actors, a music score recorded specifically for the production and sound effects completely recorded in the field in many locations across the west. Produced as sort of a \"profitable hobby\" Beau L'Amour and Paul O'Dell created the production while working around their day-to-day jobs. Since this allowed them no more than nine or ten weeks a year, the show took four years to complete. During the 1960s, L'Amour intended to build a working town typical of those of the 19th century Western frontier, with buildings with false fronts situated in rows on either side of an unpaved main street and flanked by wide boardwalks before which, at various intervals, were watering troughs and hitching posts. The town, to be named Shalako after the protagonist of one of L'Amour's novels, was to have featured shops and other businesses that were typical of such towns: a barber shop, a hotel, a dry goods store, one or more saloons, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, etc. It would have offered itself as a filming location for Hollywood motion pictures concerning the Wild West. However, funding for the project fell through, and Shalako was never built. When interviewed not long before his death, he was asked which among his books he liked best. His reply: I like them all. There's bits and pieces of books that I think are good. I never rework a book. I'd rather use what I've learned on the next one, and make it a little bit better. The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now. The critic Jon Tuska, surveying Western literature, writes: I have no argument that L'Amour's total sales have probably surpassed every other author of Western fiction in the history of the genre. Indeed, at the time of his death his sales had topped 200,000,000. What I would question is the degree and extent of his effect \"upon the American Imagination\". His Western fiction is strictly formulary and frequently, although not always, features the ranch romance plot where the hero and the heroine are to marry at the end once the villains have been defeated. Not only is there nothing really new in the basic structure of his stories, even L'Amour's social Darwinism, which came to characterize his later fiction, was scarcely original and was never dramatized in other media the way it was in works based on Zane Grey's fiction. But Tuska also notes \"At his best, L'Amour was a master of spectacular action and stories with a vivid, propulsive forward motion.\" In May 1972 he was awarded an Honorary PhD by Jamestown College, as a testament to his literary and social contributions. \"Bendigo Shafter\" (1979) won the U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Western. In 1982 he received the Congressional Gold Medal, and in 1984 President Ronald Reagan awarded L'Amour the Presidential Medal of Freedom. L'Amour is also a recipient of North Dakota's Roughrider Award. L'Amour died from lung cancer on 10 June 1988, at his home in Los Angeles, and was buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery near the Great Mausoleum in the Mausoleum Slope, Distinguished Memorial, Space 59 in Glendale, California. His autobiography detailing his years as an itinerant worker in the west, \"Education of a Wandering Man\", was published posthumously in 1989. He was survived by his wife, Kathy, and their two children, Beau and Angelique.  \"In fictional story order (not the order written).\" There are also two Sackett-related short stories: Sacketts are also involved in the plot of 7 other novels:   Originally published under the pseudonym \"Tex Burns\". Louis L'Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy books in the spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday's Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. The reason given to his young son for doing this was, \"I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn't go on them. So now, when people ask me if they were mine, I say 'no.'\" When his son asked if this would be a lie, he said, \"I just wrote them for hire. They weren't my books.\""], "neg": ["Chouteau\nChouteau Chouteau was the name of a highly successful, ethnically French fur-trading family based in Saint Louis, Missouri, which they helped to found. Its members established posts in the Midwest and Western United States, particularly along the Missouri River and in the Southwest. Various locations were named after this family.  The family sold the Chouteau posts along the upper Missouri River in 1865 after the American Civil War to Americans James B. Hubbell, Alpheus F. Hawley, James A. Smith, C. Francis Bates. Hubbell, based in Minnesota, already had some licenses from the federal government to trade with Native Americans in the West. He and his colleague Hawley formed a partnership with these men to set up a business. They formed the Northwestern Fur Company and operated it through posts along the upper Missouri River until 1870. They closed the business due to losses of equipment and furs during the Sioux uprising and warfare during the 1860s, which resulted in a volatile environment that made it too difficult to operate."]}
{"query": "Charles de La Fosse artistic style and techniques instead of his mentorship of James Parmentier.\")", "pos": ["Charles de La Fosse\nCharles de La Fosse Charles de La Fosse (or Lafosse; June 15, 1636 – December 13, 1716) was a French painter born in Paris. He was one of the most noted and least servile pupils of Le Brun, under whose direction he shared in the chief of the great decorative works undertaken in the reign of Louis XIV. Leaving France in 1662, he spent two years in Rome and three in Venice. The influence of his prolonged studies of Veronese is evident in his \"Finding of Moses\" (Louvre), and in his \"Rape of Proserpine\" (Louvre), which he presented to the Royal Academy as his diploma picture in 1673. He was at once named assistant professor, and in 1674 the full responsibilities of the office devolved on him, but his engagements did not prevent his accepting in 1689 the invitation of Lord Montagu to decorate Montagu House situated in Bloomsbury.  He visited London twice, remaining on the second occasion—together with Rousseau and Monnoyer more than two years. William III vainly strove to detain him in England by the proposal that he should decorate Hampton Court, for Le Brun was dead, and Mansart pressed La Fosse to return to Paris to take in hand the cupola of Les Invalides. The decorations of Montagu House are destroyed, those of Versailles are restored, and the dome of the Invalides (engraved, Picart and Cochin) is now the only work existing which gives a full measure of his talent. During his latter years La Fosse executed many other important decorations in public buildings and private houses, notably in that of Crozat, under whose roof he died on 13 December 1716. The artis't works and conception played a key role in the French art history from shifting the classicism of the French style from the court of Louis XIV towards the lighter and more playful Rococo period's style.

He taught the architect Le Corbusier. It is possible that Le Corbusier was influenced in his choice of pseudonym by the name of his teacher. At the time La Chaux-de-Fonds was developing into one of the leading centres of the Swiss watch industry. Increasing prosperity created a large demand for property and art in the style of the time among the wealthy citizens of the city. L'Éplattenier and his students developed a local form of Art Nouveau known as \"style sapin\" (\"pine style\") after a frequently recurring motif. \"Style sapin\" is characterised by an intensive study of nature and the artistic stylization of indigenous structures. L'Éplattenier's works include monuments to the Republic and the politician Numa Droz in La Chaux-de-Fonds, figures and decorative elements in the town's crematorium and at the cemetery, as well as repoussé and enamel watch case designs for the Gallet Watch Company. Upon funding for construction at the bequeath of Léon Gallet, the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), was built to L'Éplattenier's designs.

L’Éplattenier designed in 1906 the 'Helvetia Brustbild' postage stamp for a new Swiss definitive series issued November 11, 1907.

She won the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical in 1977 for her performance as Miss Hannigan in \"Annie\". Loudon was also nominated for Tony Awards for her lead performances in the musicals \"The Fig Leaves Are Falling\" and \"Ballroom\", as well as a Golden Globe award for her appearances on \"The Garry Moore Show\". Loudon was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1925 (she later shaved eight years off her age) and raised in Claremont, New Hampshire and Indianapolis, Indiana. She attended Syracuse University on a drama scholarship but did not graduate, and moved to New York City to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began singing in night clubs, mingling song with ad-libbed comedy patter, and was featured on television on \"The Perry Como Show\" and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Loudon made her stage debut in 1962 in \"The World of Jules Feiffer\", a play with incidental music by Stephen Sondheim, under the direction of Mike Nichols. That same year she made her Broadway debut in \"Nowhere to Go but Up\", which ran only two weeks but earned her good reviews and the Theatre World Award. In 1969, \"The Fig Leaves Are Falling\" ran for only four performances, although it won her the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical. She followed this with a revival of \"Three Men on a Horse\" directed by George Abbott; \"Lolita, My Love\", which closed out-of-town during its pre-Broadway tryout; and a revival of the Clare Boothe Luce comedy \"The Women\". Loudon's performance as the evil orphanage administrator Miss Hannigan in \"Annie\" won her the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical in 1977. In the show she introduced the seminal showtunes \"Little Girls\" and \"Easy Street.\" Of her portrayal, Clive Barnes wrote, \"As the wicked Miss Hannigan, Dorothy Loudon, eyes bulging with envy, face sagging with hatred, is deliciously and deliriously horrid. She never puts a sneer, a leer, or even a scream in the wrong place, and her singing has just the right brassy bounce to it.\" Loudon later revisited the character of Miss Hannigan in the ill-fated 1990 sequel, \"Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge\", which closed quickly after a dismal pre-Broadway engagement in Washington D.C. In 1979, Michael Bennett cast Loudon as Bea Asher, a widow who becomes romantically involved with a mail carrier she meets at the local dance hall, in \"Ballroom\". She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. She performed the number \"Fifty Percent\" from the musical during that year's Tony Awards ceremony. During her rendition of George Gershwin's \"Vodka\" at the 1983 Tony Awards ceremony while resplendent in a blue sequined gown, she ad-libbed \"I'm too good for this room. I'm too good for this song...but I'm not too good for this dress!\" At the 38th Annual Tony Awards ceremony in 1984, Loudon performed \"Broadway Baby\" from \"Follies\". In \"The New York Times\", John O'Connor said of her performance, \"Miss Loudon has developed the art of mugging into something of a hyperactive disease.\" In 1980, Loudon succeeded Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett in Stephen Sondheim's \"Sweeney Todd\". In reviewing her performance for the \"Christian Science Monitor\", David Sterritt said, \"Her body sways like a reed in the emotional storms of her own scatter-brained creation, and her off-hand manner becomes still more off-handed when the most explosive matters are at stake ... Loudon gives a comic characterization in the most classical tradition.\" The following year she co-starred with Katharine Hepburn and Julia Barr in the play \"The West Side Waltz\". In 1982 she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. She appeared in the 1983 Jerry Herman revue \"Jerry's Girls\" and later the same year she played the role of the miserable middle-aged actress Dotty Otley on Broadway in Michael Frayn's farce \"Noises Off\". Loudon was chosen as the replacement for Carol Burnett when Burnett left \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1962. Although that collaboration was not altogether successful, the excellent reviews she received the same year for her Broadway debut in \"Nowhere to Go but Up\" proved prophetic. Coincidentally, the two roles Loudon later played so successfully on Broadway stage —Miss Hannigan and Dotty Otley — were both played by Burnett onscreen. She also was a frequent guest star on many New York based comedy and game shows. In 1979, Loudon starred in the television series \"Dorothy\", in which she portrayed a former showgirl teaching music and drama at a boarding school for girls. It lasted only one season. She appeared in only two films, playing an agent in the film \"Garbo Talks\" (1984) and a Southern eccentric in \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" (1997). Loudon was married to composer Norman Paris (born Norman Thaddeus Paris; 1925-1977) from 1971 to 1977. Together they had no children and Loudon never remarried. She died in New York City, aged 78, from cancer, and was interred in Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. Loudon left no immediate survivors but was survived by two step-children from her marriage to Paris."], "neg": ["Tony Award\nTony Award The Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre, more commonly known as the Tony Award, recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre. The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League at an annual ceremony in New York City. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances, and an award is given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are also given, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award. The awards are named after Antoinette \"Tony\" Perry, co-founder of the American Theatre Wing. The rules for the Tony Awards are set forth in the official document \"Rules and Regulations of The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards\", which applies for that season only. The Tony Awards are considered the highest U.S. theatre honor, the New York theatre industry's equivalent to the Academy Awards (Oscars) for film, the Emmy Awards for television, and the Grammy Awards for music. It also forms the fourth spoke in the EGOT, that is, someone who has won all four awards. The Tony Awards are also considered the equivalent of the Laurence Olivier Awards in the United Kingdom and the Molière Awards in France. From 1997 to 2010, the Tony Awards ceremony was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in June and broadcast live on CBS television, except in 1999, when it was held at the Gershwin Theatre. In 2011 and 2012, the ceremony was held at the Beacon Theatre. From 2013 to 2015, the 67th, 68th, and 69th ceremonies returned to Radio City Music Hall. The 70th Tony Awards was held on June 12, 2016 at the Beacon Theatre. The 71st Tony Awards and 72nd Tony Awards were held at Radio City Music Hall in 2017 and 2018, respectively. , there are 26 categories of awards, plus several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called \"Best Author (Musical)\". The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960. A newly established non-competitive award, The Isabelle Stevenson Award, was given for the first time at the awards ceremony in 2009. The award is for an individual who has made a \"substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of one or more humanitarian, social service or charitable organizations\". The category of Best Special Theatrical Event was retired as of the 2009–2010 season. The categories of Best Sound Design of a Play and Best Sound Design of a Musical were retired as of the 2014-2015 season. On April 24, 2017, the Tony Awards administration committee announced that the Sound Design Award would be reintroduced for the 2017-2018 season. Performance categories Show and technical categories Special awards Retired awards The award was founded in 1947 by a committee of the American Theatre Wing headed by Brock Pemberton. The award is named after Antoinette Perry, nicknamed Tony, an actress, director, producer and co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, who died in 1946. As her official biography at the Tony Awards website states, \"At <nowiki>[</nowiki>Warner Bros. story editor] Jacob Wilk's suggestion, [Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and technical achievement. At the initial event in 1947, as he handed out an award, he called it a Tony. The name stuck.\" The first awards ceremony was held on April 6, 1947, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. The first prizes were \"a scroll, cigarette lighter and articles of jewelry such as 14-carat gold compacts and bracelets for the women, and money clips for the men\". It was not until the third awards ceremony in 1949 that the first Tony medallion was given to award winners. Awarded by a panel of approximately 868 voters (as of 2014) from various areas of the entertainment industry and press. Since 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in \"The New York Times\": \"What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said...\" The viewership has declined from the early years of its broadcast history (for example, the number of viewers in 1974 was 20,026,000, in 1999 9,155,000) but has settled into between six and eight million viewers for most of the decade of the 2000s. In contrast, the 2009 Oscar telecast had 36.3 million viewers. The Tony Award medallion was designed by art director Herman Rosse and is a mix of mostly brass and a little bronze, with a nickel plating on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel. The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967. A larger base was introduced in time for the 2010 award ceremony. The new base is slightly taller , up from and heavier , up from . This change was implemented to make the award \"feel more substantial\" and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners. According to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing: For the specific Tony Awards presented to a Broadway production, awards are given to the author and up to two of the producers free of charge. All other members of the above-the-title producing team are eligible to purchase the physical award. Sums collected are designed to help defray the cost of the Tony Awards ceremony itself. An award cost $400 as of at least 2000, $750 as of at least 2009, and, as of 2013, had been $2,500 \"for several years\", according to Tony Award Productions. \"Source: Tony Awards Official Site, Rules\" For the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not \"determined… to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire\", as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations). The rule about \"classic\" productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) \"A play or musical that is determined ... to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an Award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category.\" Shows transferred from Off-Broadway or the West End are eligible as \"new\", as are productions based closely on films. This rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows have been ruled ineligible for the \"new\" category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as \"new\" gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters. The Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors' Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. This committee, among other duties, determines eligibility for nominations in all awards categories. The Tony Awards Nominating Committee makes the nominations for the various categories. This rotating group of theatre professionals is selected by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. Nominators serve three-year terms and are asked to see every new Broadway production. The Nominating Committee for the 2012-13 Broadway season (named in June 2012) had 42 members; the Nominating Committee for the 2014-2015 season has 50 members and was appointed in June 2014. There are approximately 868 eligible Tony Award voters (as of 2014), a number that changes slightly from year to year. The number was decreased in 2009 when the first-night critics were excluded as voters. That decision was changed, and members of the New York Drama Critics' Circle were invited to be Tony voters beginning in the 2010-2011 season. The eligible Tony voters include the board of directors and designated members of the advisory committee of the American Theatre Wing, members of the governing boards of Actors' Equity Association, the Dramatists Guild, the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, United Scenic Artists, and the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, members of the Theatrical Council of the Casting Society of America and voting members of The Broadway League (in 2000, what was then The League of American Theaters and Producers changed membership eligibility and Tony voting status from a lifetime honor to all above-the-title producers, to ones who had been active in the previous 10 years. This action disenfranchised scores of Tony voters, including Gail Berman, Harve Brosten, Dick Button, Tony Lo Bianco, and Raymond Serra). To be eligible for Tony Award consideration, a production must have officially opened on Broadway by the eligibility date that the Management Committee establishes each year. For example, the cut-off date for eligibility the 2013–2014 season was April 24, 2014. The season for Tony Award eligibility is defined in the Rules and Regulations. A Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements. While the rules define a Broadway theatre in terms of its size, not its geographical location, the list of Broadway theatres is determined solely by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. As of the 2016–2017 season, the list consisted solely of the 41 theaters located in the vicinity of Times Square in New York City and Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater. While the theatre-going public may consider the Tony Awards to be the Oscars of live theatre, critics have suggested that the Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City. In a 2014 \"Playbill\" article, Robert Simonson wrote that \"Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, what they get to perform, and for how long, have long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community...\" The producers \"accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales.\" Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, \"you’re going to spike at the box office\". The awards met further criticism when they eliminated the sound design awards in 2014. In 2014, a petition calling for the return of the Sound Design categories received more than 30,000 signatures. Addressing their previous concerns over Tony voters in the category, it was announced that upon the awards' return for the 2017-2018 season, they would be decided by a subset of voters based on their expertise.

{"query": "The Lizzie Bennet Diaries web series production details instead of plot summary and awards", "pos": ["The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\nThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is an American web series adapted from Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice.\" The story is conveyed in the form of vlogs. It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su, produced by Jenni Powell and stars Ashley Clements, Mary Kate Wiles, Laura Spencer, Julia Cho and Daniel Vincent Gordh. It premiered on a dedicated YouTube channel on April 9, 2012, and subsequently concluded when the 100th episode was posted on March 28, 2013. In 2013, \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" became the first web series to win an Emmy, for Outstanding Creative Achievement In Interactive Media – Original Interactive Program. The story is told in vlog-style by the eponymous character; each episode is between two and eight minutes long. As the show primarily takes place in Lizzie's bedroom, many major events happen offscreen and are retold by Lizzie, with her friend Charlotte and sisters Lydia and Jane adding different perspectives. Occasionally they perform reenactments, using a recurring costume to denote who's who (such as a cap and bowtie for Darcy, a blue plaid shirt for Lizzie, etc.). From Episode 25 onwards, the show begins to visit other sets, allowing them to introduce outside characters, such as Bing Lee, Caroline, and Mr. Collins. There are also semi-frequent Q&A videos, once per every ten episodes, in which Lizzie answers questions asked by real viewers, sometimes with the help of another character. In addition to the videos, all the characters also have various social media accounts, through which they interact and reveal portions of the story and perspectives that are not necessarily represented in Lizzie's vlogs. Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Bennet is a mass communications graduate student still living at home with her parents and two sisters, the sweet, timid Jane and rebellious, party-loving Lydia. With the help of her friend Charlotte Lu, she starts a vlog series for her thesis, discussing the trials and tribulations of her daily life. Wealthy medical student Bing Lee moves into the Netherfield mansion nearby, bringing with him his even richer friend William Darcy. Mrs Bennet quickly begins conspiring to match Bing up with one of the girls, believing \"it's a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\" When the Bennets finally meet the new neighbors at a wedding, Jane and Bing instantly have chemistry, but Darcy's rude and snobbish behaviour causes Lizzie to dislike him. At VidCon, Charlotte and Lizzie run into childhood friend Ricky Collins, who now runs online media company \"Collins and Collins,\" with the help of his wealthy patron Ms Catherine de Bourgh. He proposes Lizzie join him as a business partner, but she declines. Charlotte accepts the offer in her place. During this time Lydia starts her own vlog series. While at a bar with Lydia, Lizzie meets swim coach George Wickham and begins seeing him. He reveals Darcy was a family friend who supposedly refused to give him a college fund he was promised, furthering Lizzie's poor opinion of the man. Lizzie quickly moves on when it becomes apparent George isn't that into her. Though their relationship had been going well, Bing suddenly leaves for L.A. without telling Jane. Lizzie assumes Darcy must have poisoned Bing's opinion of her sister. Lizzie decides to spend her last semester shadowing at companies, starting with C&C. There she runs into Darcy, who's been asked to monitor the company by his aunt, Catherine. He confronts Lizzie and reveals he's in love with her. She furiously tells him she could never love him back, because of his rudeness and how he's hurt George and Jane, accidentally revealing the existence of the vlogs in the process. After watching them all, he gives her a letter explaining his side of things. He steered Bing away from Jane because he thought she was only being nice. George was given enough money to pay his full college tuition, but spent it all in one year and then became angry when Darcy refused to give him more. Lydia misinterprets one of Lizzie's 21st birthday presents and storms off to Las Vegas for New Years, and eventually begins dating George Wickham. Lizzie discovers the final company she's to visit, Pemberley Digital, belongs to Darcy. They begin spending time together, now on better terms, but their growing friendship is cut short when Lizzie has to rush home, having been informed there's a website counting down to the release of a sex tape involving George and Lydia. Lizzie and Lydia haven't spoken since Christmas. When Lizzie confronts Lydia, it transpires Lydia didn't know about the website. Jane urges Lizzie to watch all of Lydia's videos, after which Lizzie realizes her younger sister isn't as shallow as she thought and that she doesn't really know Lydia all that well. Lydia herself realizes she's been selfish and breaks down crying in Lizzie's arms and the two sisters reconcile. The day the sex-tape is meant to go live, the website disappears. During her healing journey, Lydia discovers that Darcy has bought the company that owns the website and all rights to the video. Lizzie realizes she loves him, but thinks it's come too late. Bing returns to apologize; he discovered Lizzie's vlogs and saw how much Jane cared about him in them, and the two get back together. Darcy confesses to Lizzie that he still loves her, and the two finally get together. Lizzie decides what to do in her professional life and decides to stop vlogging so she can focus on actually living her life.  In addition to Lizzie's vlogging, other characters also released videos which provided access to alternate perspectives and story elements. Lydia decides to start her own vlog series while Lizzie is away. As its main purpose is to show Lydia's story arc when she can't appear on the main webshow, it's only ever maintained when she and Lizzie are apart, such as when Lizzie is staying at Netherfield or visiting companies. It allows the audience to witness things like Lydia becoming friends with her cousin Mary, running away to LA to see her sister Jane, meeting George Wickham in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, and having a relationship with him. Unlike the main webshow, Lydia's vlogs are not stationary, are all one single continuous take (presumably as Lydia would consider learning how to edit a nerdy thing to do), and rarely ever set in the same place twice. After beginning her job at Collins and Collins, Charlotte gets her younger sister Maria Lu a summer internship, who documents the experience in a series of video diaries. Mr. Collins's company produces instructional videos called \"Better Living with Collins and Collins.\" Currently, there are eight episodes. Hosted by Darcy's younger sister Gigi, Pemberley Digital posts demo videos to unveil and promote their new prototype: \"Domino,\" an application that can automatically edit and upload videos recorded on it. This premise allows the audience to see Darcy and Gigi's efforts to track down George Wickham and get his website taken down, before he releases a sex tape he filmed involving Lydia. Taking place after the events of \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\", \"Welcome to Sanditon\" follows Gigi Darcy as she spends her summer in Sanditon, CA to run a beta demo of the Pemberley Digital Domino application. The residents of Sanditon have all been invited to join in the test, and discover how this “life-revealing” app performs. The mini-series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's unfinished novel, \"Sanditon\". One notable difference from the source material is Gigi replaces the unfinished novel's original heroine, Charlotte Heywood (as \"Sanditon\" is actually not connected to \"Pride and Prejudice\" in any way). Taking place after the events of \"Welcome to Sanditon\", \"Emma Approved\" focuses on Emma Woodhouse, a confident and proud female entrepreneur who believes she is an excellent matchmaker. The series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, \"Emma\". One notable difference from the source material is Caroline Lee replaces Augusta Hawkins as Philip Elton's wife (as \"Emma\" is actually not connected to \"Pride and Prejudice\" in any way). \"The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet\" is a book by Kate Rorick and Rachel Kiley, and audiobook with Mary Kate Wiles performing all the voices, telling Lydia's story from a few months after TLBD for about a year. \"The Guardian\" called \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" \"the best Austen adaptation around\" at the 200th anniversary of \"Pride and Prejudice\". In 2013 it was announced that \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" will be awarded an award for Original Interactive Program at the Creative Arts Emmys, becoming the first digital series to win an Emmy Award. In 2014, \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" YouTube Channel was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #40.

Following a test event in 1991, it was officially launched in 1994. Organised by the Association of the Balkan Athletics Federations (ABAF), it is typically held in February. The competition complemented the long-running annual outdoor track and field tournament: the Balkan Games. It received strong support from the Hellenic Amateur Athletic Association – until 2002, the Peace and Friendship Stadium in Piraeus, Greece was the permanent host, as this was the only international standard indoor track and field arena in the region at that point. The Peania Indoors Arena, also near the Greek capital, took on hosting duties from 2003 to 2006, then began alternating with the Piraeus stadium. The event was cancelled in both 2010 and 2011 due to the insolvency of the Greek athletics body, linked to the Greek government-debt crisis. The event was continued in 2012 with Turkey as the new host nation, which had built the Ataköy Athletics Arena for the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The Balkan competition served as a major test event for the global championships. The programme of events has been similar to that of the IAAF World Indoor Championships, except for the omission of the combined track and field events and (usually) the 4 × 400 metres relay. Women's pole vault was introduced in 1998, giving the sexes event parity, and the 200 metres for both sexes was dropped after 2005 in line with international standards. The 1994 championships featured racewalking competitions, but these were dropped for subsequent editions. In addition to individual titles, a men's and a women's team title is awarded to the best performing nation in each section. Both medal tables and points tables are collated, with the points score contributing to the team title. The points table was introduced in 2002. A total of seventeen nations have entered the competition during its history, with Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro being former competitors; all successor states of Yugoslavia have since competed independently, bar Kosovo. The initial competition was between six nations, which expanded to nine by the end of the 1990s. The number of competing nations was further expanded between 2011 and 2014, with five more countries being admitted by the ABAF. Azerbaijan has also competed as a guest nation; its performances were discounted for medal and points-scoring purposes. Romania and Greece have historically been the most successful nations at the event, although Turkey has been the most dominant since 2012.  Key:"]}

In 2004, he released his first live album and DVD titled Transparent - Live, where it sold 200,000 copies and marked the year with the success of the track \"Half of Me.\" In 2007, she changed her artistic name to only Wanessa, releasing the album \"Total\". The album sold about 100,000 copies and gave the singer his first certified platinum, marking the great success of the single \"Abrázame\", partnership with Mexican banking Camila.

In 2011, she released his seventh album \"DNA\", completely in English.", "W (Wanessa Camargo album)\nW (Wanessa Camargo album) W is the fourth studio album by Brazilian recording artist Wanessa, released on August 1, 2005. It was released on August 8, 2005, through Sony BMG, followed by a release in other countries three years later on RCA Records. After fulfilling several appointments on her schedule, such as the release of her first live album \"Transparente\" and appearances on television, the singer had more time to record her fourth album. In the meantime, its producer César Lemos. Camargo composed eleven of the fifteen tracks of the album, distancing himself more from romantic music to try new styles. W incorporates different styles from their previous albums, which were more country pop, although the beginning of the album is like this, and experience rock in tracks like \"Knock, Knock, Knock\" and \"Minha Vida Gira em Torno de Você\" and the dance pop in tracks like \"Amor, Amor\". As of March 2006, more than 50,000 copies of the product were purchased in Brazil. Of W three singles were released. The first, \"Amor, Amor\", had a great repercussion in Brazil, becoming one of the most executed in the country. His music video was recorded at the Music School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro under the direction of Victor Botta. The second, \"Não Resisto a Nós Dois\", repeated the success of the previous one, being among the five most played in the city of São Paulo. The third, \"Louca\", did not have some kind of music video or strong publicity, being sent only to the radios. A tour was also made to promote the album, entitled \"W in Tour ... Era Uma Vez\" and directed by the actress Marília Pêra. In October 2002, Wanessa began to present the program \"Jovens Tardes\" in Rede Globo, launching its third self-titled album of self in December of that year. The disc was gold-certified by the Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos (ABPD) in 2003. In the same year, the singer recorded her first DVD; she described it as the \"realization of a dream\" and commented that \"all that is happening is the materialization of a dream. Since I was little I wanted to be on the stage singing. Even when I danced with my father and my uncle showed us theirs, I dreamed of my moment\". The product was distributed on May 24, 2004, with \"Me Engana que Eu Gosto\" being released as a single on the same day. The artist also made several television appearances at the time, as in the children's show \"Sítio do Picapau Amarelo\", debuting as an actress and playing Diana Dechamps, in \"Quebrando a Rotina\", in which the artist only entered as a participant, along with Felipe Dylon. After finishing these appointments, the artist decided to work on her fourth studio album. Still during the recording, its producer César Lemos presented to him the Latin rhythms, which the interpreter said that \"fell in love\" because \"it has a beat that makes us feel like dancing, to move the waist\". The singer also wrote eleven of the fifteen tracks of the album. In an interview with the Resenhando portal, she said to compose \"at unusual times, in moments when I'm alone and start writing. There is no time, no right place.\" \"W\" is an album that derives from the musical genres Soft rock, dance-pop and its composition consists of romantic bands to songs with the electronic style. The interpreter reported on the release of his album that in the process of composing the same, his \"desire to vent was too great\" and that he was \"reclusive at the end of 2004 to question my life and my dreams\". She also said that the CD is \"a cry of freedom, an encounter with myself.\" The song that starts the album, \"Relax\", was reviewed by the Musical Universe, which said that \"verses there Roberto and Erasmo like \"Live life without hurry / Be happy is what matter\" and \"Life is yours , how to live\" may even be good advice to others, but rather have been well assimilated by those who wrote them.\" \"My Life Spins Around You\" is a ballad written by the interpreter and her father, Zezé di Camargo. Third track of the album, \"Culpada\" takes away the myth of eternal male guilt, revealing that women also betray in lines like \"The taste of sin I also tasted / I was worse than you / Because I knew how to hide.\" Already the fifth track of the disc, \"Não Resisto a Nós Dois\", displays riffs of guitar, in a rock melody. Other tracks that explore rock include \"Chamar Atenção\" and \"Knock, Knock, Knock\", the latter being turned to folk. From the ninth track of the album, \"Eu Sou\", the electronic style begins. The original version of the composition of \"Te Quero Só Me\" is called \"Sure Thing\", while \"Me Devorar\" shows influences of the disco music. The twelfth composition, \"Amor, Amor\", follows the line of Latin pop, having been compared by the \"Universo Musical\" to the songs of the Rouge group. The track \"Meu Menino\" quotes Prince, an American musical artist. The album ends with \"Era uma Vez\", the only track that only Wanessa composed. Initial reviews for \" W \" have been mixed. \"The Washington Post\"'s Alison Stewart offered a negative view on the project, writing that Wanessa \"began a bad year with a bad record.\" In his written evaluation to the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\", Piet Levy wrote that Campbell is \"less an anxious child than an adult\" in this new project, although when Wanessa flat come-ons are juxtaposed with experienced R&B of course as an interpreter, he still has a lot of growing to do. Pop portal commenter found the genres of the album \"strange\" according stating that \"Wanessa had outdone himself this time.\" already critical \"Manoel Grachi\" found the excellent album of others who did wanessa saying: \"You can see she grew a lot in this last record, although the songs are alternative versions to liguagem her, she demonstrated that knows how to do it well\"He said the commentator, other critics of contemporary music found a poor mix of genres, saying Wanessa not used the Latin genres. \"Amor, Amor\" was released as the first and lead single by \"W\" on June 11, 2005. It gained a great repercussion in Brazil, becoming one of the ten most played in the country in the week of August 10 of that year according to measurement done by Crowley Broadcast Analysis. His corresponding music video, directed by Victor Botta and recorded in the School of Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, shows Camargo performing dance steps while the music is reproduced.

{"query": "Pyralidae ecological roles instead of morphological characteristics", "pos": ["Pyraloidea\nPyraloidea The Pyraloidea (pyraloid moths) are a moth superfamily containing about 16,000 described species worldwide (Munroe & Solis 1998), and probably at least as many more remain to be described. They are generally fairly small moths. This superfamily used to contain the Hyblaeidae, Thyrididae, Alucitidae (plus Tineodidae), Pterophoridae, and Pyralidae. Currently, the Crambidae are usually separated from the Pyralidae, but the first four families are now each split off as a distinct superfamily. Some genera (e.g. \"Hydriris\", \"Micronix\" and \"Tanaobela\") still defy easy classification and have been variously assigned to the Crambidae or the Pyralidae. Among all Lepidoptera, pyraloids show the most diverse life history adaptations. The larvae of most species feed on living plants either internally or externally as leaf rollers, leaf webbers leaf miners, borers, root feeders, and seed feeders. Some species live parasitically in ant nests (Wurthiinae), prey on scale insects (certain Phycitinae), or live in the nests of bees (Galleriinae). The larvae of the Acentropinae are adapted to life under water, and certain Phycitinae and Pyralinae are adapted to very dry environments and their larvae feed on stored food products. Others feed on animal detritus such as carrion and feces. With such a variety of living habits, pyraloids are used in biodiversity studies (Schulze & Fiedler 2003). Some species are of economic importance, e.g.: Munroe, E. G. & M. A. Solis 1998: The Pyraloidea. Pp. 233–256. – In: Kristensen, N. P., Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies.

Spatio-temporal resource use in the canopy. – Cambridge University Press.", "Pyralidae\nPyralidae The Pyralidae, commonly called pyralid moths, snout moths or grass moths, are a family of Lepidoptera in the ditrysian superfamily Pyraloidea. In many (particularly older) classifications, the grass moths (Crambidae) are included in the Pyralidae as a subfamily, making the combined group one of the largest families in the Lepidoptera. The latest review by Eugene G. Munroe & Solis, in Kristensen (1999) retains the Crambidae as a full family of Pyraloidea. The wingspans for small and medium-sized species usually between 9 and 37 mm with variable morphological features. It is a diverse group, with more than 6,000 species described worldwide, and more than 600 species in America north of Mexico, comprising the third largest moth family in North America. At least 42 species have been recorded from North Dakota in the subfamilies of Pyralidae. Most of these small moths are inconspicuous. Many are economically important pests, including waxworms, which are the caterpillar larvae of the greater (\"Galleria mellonella\") and lesser (\"Achroia grisella\") wax moths (subfamily Galleriinae). They are natively pests of beehives, but are bred indoors in enormous numbers as live food for small reptile and bird pets and similar animals. They are also used as fishing bait for trout fishing. Other notable snout moth pests relevant for their larval hosts include: The European corn borer (\"Ostrinia nubilalis\") and southern cornstalk borer (\"Diatraea crambidoides\"), formerly considered snout moths, are placed in the Crambidae which, as noted above, are usually regarded as a separate family today. Five subfamilies are generally recognized in the Pyralidae today. The Acentropinae (= Nymphulinae), occasionally still placed here, do indeed seem to belong in the Crambidae. The snout moth subfamilies are, listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence from the most primitive to the most advanced:  In addition to those assigned to the tribes above, several genera of (presumed) Pyralidae are not firmly placed in this arrangement. Some may be very basal lineages which stand outside the main snout moth radiations, but given the changing circumscription of the Pyralidae, some are likely to be placed outside this group in its modern meaning, either in the Crambidae or in other lineages of basal Obtectomera. Some may even belong to more ancient moth lineages, such as the Alucitoidea or Pterophoroidea. Finally, some of these (usually little-studied) genera possibly are junior synonyms of genera described earlier.These genera are in the unranked category of the family Pyralidae. The genera in question are: These genera have been placed in the Pyralidae when these were still circumscribed \"sensu lato\" and are sometimes still treated thus, but actually they seem to belong in the Crambidae (see also \"Micronix\" and \"Tanaobela\"):", "Pyralinae\nPyralinae The Pyralinae are the typical subfamily of snout moths (family Pyralidae) and occur essentially worldwide, in some cases aided by involuntary introduction by humans. They are rather rare in the Americas however, and their diversity in the Australian region is also limited. Altogether, this subfamily includes about 900 described species, but new ones continue to be discovered. Like many of their relatives in the superfamily Pyraloidea, the caterpillar larvae of many Pyralinae – and in some cases even the adults – have evolved the ability to use unusual foods for nutrition; a few of these can become harmful to humans as pests of stored goods. This subfamily unites generally mid-sized to smallish moths with a more or less cryptic coloration including most often various hues of brownish colors. Adult females of Pyralinae (except \"Cardamyla\" and \"Embryoglossa\") are characterized by the short genital ductus bursae, their corpus bursae barely extending forward beyond abdominal segment 7. Otherwise they are rather nondescript mid-sized moths (large by Pyralidae standards) which at least sometimes can be distinguished from their relatives by possessing forewing vein 7 and having hindwing veins 7 and 8 unjoined as adults. The meal moth (\"Pyralis farinalis\") and the grease moth (\"Aglossa pinguinalis\") are pests of stored food products, in the case of the grease moth including fats (which are also eaten by the adult moths), and have been inadvertently spread almost worldwide by transport of such goods. Most other species' caterpillars are leaf feeders; the extremely polyphagous larvae of \"Pyralis manihotalis\" have been reared from bat guano. The systematics and taxonomy of this subfamily is somewhat provisional. No quantitative phylogenetic analysis had been done as of 2007, though in the mid-late 1990s Michael Shaffer of the London Natural History Museum and M.A. Solis of the NMNH prepared the groundwork for further studies by their comprehensive qualitative reviews of Pyralinae morphology. Some cladistic studies of the Pyraloidea do exist however, and these place the Pyralinae among the advanced snout moths, a lineage which otherwise includes the even more autapomorphic subfamilies Epipaschiinae and Phycitinae. Even though the Pyralinae contain a high number of genera and species, there are a mere three tribes generally accepted nowadays; others that were proposed earlier (in some cases even as independent subfamilies within Pyralidae) are presently treated as junior synonyms of the Pyralini. A large number of genera are considered not to be reliably assignable to one of the three tribes; it is not at all certain that the presently-used subdivisions of the Pyralinae are the last word on the issue. The tribes – with some significant genera and species also noted – and the genera of unclear affiliation in this subfamily are: Genera \"incertae sedis\" The genus \"Micronix\", formerly placed here, seems to belong to the Crambidae, but its exact placement is obscure.

It is the largest such continuous remnant in the state. The forest is located near the towns of Baradine and Narrabri and the villages of Pilliga and Gwabegar. Most land within the Pilliga is in crown tenure, either as State Forest, Nature Reserve, State Conservation Area or National Park.  Author Eric Rolls wrote a historic account of the Pilliga called \"A Million Wild Acres\", which gives an insight into the history of the region. One of Rolls' most-cited conclusions is that the forest used to be an open woodland forest and that European influence has enabled the cypress pine to dominate. However, many scientific authors now disagree with much of Rolls' analysis, quoting historical records from as early as the 1870s which suggest that the plant communities in the scrub have not undergone the level of alteration that Rolls suggests. However most of his history of the region is uncontested and his book remains an invaluable document for understanding the region. The geology of the area is dominated by Pilliga sandstone, a coarse red to yellow Jurassic sandstone containing about 75% quartz, 15% plagioclase and 10% iron oxide, although local variations in soil type do occur. Sandstone outcrops with basalt-capped ridges are common in the south, while the Pilliga outwash areas in the north and west are dominated by alluvium from flooding creeks. Gilgais occur in some areas. In the west \"sand monkeys\" (abandoned creek beds) are common. In the east is a heavily eroded sandstone mountain range, visible in outcrops such as those around Gin's Leap between Baan Baa and Boggabri. The forest contains at least 900 plant species, including some now widely grown in cultivation as well as many threatened species. Some areas of the forest, particularly in the western Pilliga, are dominated by cypress-pine (\"Callitris\" spp.). However, there are a variety of distinct plant communities in the forest, some of which do not include \"Callitris\", such as mallee and heathland. Another prominent sub-canopy genus are the she-oaks, while eucalypts dominate the canopy throughout the forest. Fauna recorded from the Pilliga Nature Reserve include at least 40 native and nine introduced mammals, 50 reptiles and at least 15 frogs. Squirrel gliders, koalas, rufous bettongs and Pilliga mice are present. A 4,909 km tract of land, including the forest and the nearby Warrumbungle National Park, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of painted honeyeaters and diamond firetails. It also experiences irregular occurrences of endangered swift parrots and regent honeyeaters, and near threatened bush stone-curlews. Other declining woodland birds present in good numbers include barking owls, glossy black-cockatoos, grey-crowned babblers, speckled warblers, brown treecreepers, hooded robins and turquoise parrots. Fire plays a major role in the ecology of the forest with many plant species depending on fire to regenerate. However, in unfavorable conditions fire can be extremely intense, spread very quickly and threaten nearby properties as well as laying waste to entire ecosystems. If intense fires occur less than 15 years apart there can be a loss of plant and animal biodiversity. The magnitude of historical Pilliga bushfires correlates extremely well with the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena, with El Nino (dry) years having the most severe fires. In 1997 a major fire burned close to 1,435 km of the forest. An extremely dry winter and spring in 2006 saw a number of large fires develop, including the Pilliga 4 Fire in November/December which burned out 740 km on just its first day. Towns in the area include Narrabri, Pilliga, Gwabegar, Baradine, Coonabarabran, Boggabri and Baan Baa. There is an extensive network of roads throughout the scrub, many of which are former forestry roads. The forest once supported a large forestry industry in the surrounding towns (harvesting mostly cypress pine and ironbarks) however this has been greatly scaled back since 2005 when much of the forest was set aside for environmental conservation by the NSW government. There are many attractions in the forest, including:"]}

The Canadian National Railway (CNR) took over the station in 1923, when they absorbed the Grand Trunk Railway. CNR discontinued passenger train service at the station in 1932 and demolished the building in 1974. The station was originally built at grade, with a level crossing at Queen Street. This level crossing was considered very dangerous and on November 17, 1904, a collision here between a Toronto Railway Company streetcar and a GTR freight train killed three people and injured seventeen. Construction began in 1925 on the Toronto Grade Separation project which was completed in 1930. The rebuilding of this eastern approach, beyond the Toronto Terminals Railway limit, eliminated the level crossing.

Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs and shapes. In music, the term \"abstraction\" can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality. Atonal music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships."], "neg": ["Abstractionism\nAbstractionism Abstractionism is the theory that the mind obtains some or all of its concepts by abstracting them from concepts it already has, or from experience. One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other properties. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by George Berkeley and Peter Geach. Abstractionism has its roots in Aristotle's writings, particularly those rejecting the Platonic theory of Forms. They were adopted and developed further by the Scholastics so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century. John Locke also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences. For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things. His theory contradicts the empiricist standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration. There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor, who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts. Chomsky, for instance, explained the \"deep structure\" of the Internet or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that \"linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction.\"  Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word \"triangle\" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort."]}

The club was re-established in 2002 and has played in the Meistriliiga since 2018. Kalev's origins lie with Meteor. Jalgpalliselts Meteor (Football Association Meteor) was formed in 1909 by students Julius Reinans and Bernhard Abrams. The team was first coached by an English flax merchant John Urchard who also ordered the team's first uniforms, consisting of blue shirts and white shorts. The team included several players who would become notable athletes, such as future Estonia national team players Voldemar Luik and Otto Silber and Olympic runner Johannes Villemson. On 6 June 1909, Meteor and Merkuur played the first official football match in Estonia. The match took place at the grounds behind the Lower Lighthouse in Lasnamäe and was won by Meteor 4–2. On 27 May 1911, Meteor joined the Estonian Sports Association Kalev and changed its name to Kalev. In 1913, the team moved to the new Tiigiveski Ground. In the 1920s, the newly formed Estonian Football Championship was dominated by Tallinn sides Kalev, Sport and TJK. The derby matches between the clubs drew thousands of spectators. Kalev won their first league title in 1923. The team included Estonian internationals such as Eduard Ellmann, Ernst Joll, Elmar Kaljot, August Lass and Arnold Pihlak, who went on to represent Estonia at the 1924 Summer Olympics. On 16 August 1925, the team suffered a serious setback when the board of the association expelled eight key players from the squad over their decision to play in the opening match of TJK's new ground without the board's permission. The players subsequently joined TJK. Tallinna Kalev won their second championship in the controversial 1930 season. Although never proven officially, the victory was widely accepted as a result of match fixing. To win the title, Kalev needed to win the final game of the season against the formidable Narva Võitleja by eight goals. Kalev went on to win the match 11–0. Võitleja's performance was so poor that allegations of match fixing began instantly, with Kalev board member Aleksander Mändvere being accused of bribing Võitleja players, particularly the team's goalkeeper Viruvere. Kalev reached the 1939 Estonian Cup final, but lost to TJK 1–4. Following World War II and the Soviet occupation of Estonia, Kalev joined the Soviet Union football league system, competing in the second tier of Soviet football from 1947 to 1954, while Kalev's second team played in the Estonian championship. In 1955, Kalev's first team returned to the Estonian championship, winning their third league title in the 1955 season. In 1960, Kalev joined Class A, the top flight of Soviet football. The team finished their first season in Class A in 19th place out of 22 teams. In the 1961 season, Kalev finished last and were relegated to Class B.

{"query": "Multiprogramming techniques in modern operating systems instead of historical implementations like MFT and MVT.", "pos": ["Cooperative multitasking\nCooperative multitasking Cooperative multitasking, also known as non-preemptive multitasking, is a style of computer multitasking in which the operating system never initiates a context switch from a running process to another process. Instead, processes voluntarily yield control periodically or when idle or logically blocked in order to enable multiple applications to be run concurrently. This type of multitasking is called \"cooperative\" because all programs must cooperate for the entire scheduling scheme to work. In this scheme, the process scheduler of an operating system is known as a cooperative scheduler, having its role reduced down to starting the processes and letting them return control back to it voluntarily. Although it is rarely used in modern larger systems, it is widely used in memory-constrained embedded systems and also, in specific applications such as CICS or the JES2 subsystem. Cooperative multitasking was the primary scheduling scheme for 16-bit applications employed by Microsoft Windows before Windows 95 and Windows NT (such as Windows 3.1x), and by the classic Mac OS. Windows 9x used non-preemptive multitasking for 16-bit legacy applications, and the PowerPC Versions of Mac OS X prior to Leopard used it for classic applications. NetWare, which is a network-oriented operating system, used cooperative multitasking up to NetWare 6.5. Cooperative multitasking is still used on RISC OS systems. As a cooperatively multitasked system relies on each process regularly giving up time to other processes on the system, one poorly designed program can consume all of the CPU time for itself, either by performing extensive calculations or by busy waiting; both would cause the whole system to hang. In a server environment, this is a hazard that makes the entire environment unacceptably fragile. However, cooperative multitasking allows much simpler implementation of applications because their execution is never unexpectedly interrupted by the process scheduler; for example, various functions inside the application do not need to be reentrant. In contrast, preemptive multitasking interrupts applications and gives control to other processes outside the application's control. Cooperative multitasking is used with await in languages with a single-threaded event-loop in their runtime, like JavaScript or Python."], "neg": ["Multiboot Specification\nMultiboot Specification The Multiboot Specification is an open standard describing how a boot loader can load an x86 operating system kernel.

{"query": "Warsaw Uprising timeline and strategic importance instead of individual participant stories", "pos": ["Prelude to the Warsaw Uprising\nPrelude to the Warsaw Uprising The Warsaw Uprising occurred at a stage of the Second World War when it was becoming clear that Nazi Germany was likely to lose. The Uprising ended in capitulation, the deaths of over 250,000 civilians, and only 15% of Warsaw intact; with the benefit of hindsight, many people have argued that it should never have been started. Others have argued that it was inevitable and even crucial for Poland to prove its commitment to the Allied cause. Although Stalin was later to describe it as a \"criminal enterprise,\" just two days prior to its initiation, Radio Moscow had called for the Polish people to rise in arms. To understand the Uprising, then, it is crucial to understand the circumstances that led up to its initiation. Research in this area is difficult because the facts are not always fully available: there are still some sources of information, such as the British and Soviet archives, which remain closed (as of 2004). Therefore, analysis of the Uprising must also incoporporate the speculation, past and present, concerning the time prior to the uprising. From the very beginning of its existence the Home Army was planning a national uprising against the German forces. Initial plans created by the Polish government-in-exile in 1942 assumed that the allied invasion of Europe would lead to the withdrawal of considerable German forces from the Eastern Front for the defence of the Third Reich. The Home Army would act to prevent troop transfer to the west and to allow the British and American forces to seize Germany by breaking all communication links with the majority of German forces massed in the Soviet Union. However, by 1943 it became apparent that the allied invasion of Europe would not come in time, and that in all probability the Red Army would reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the invasion had well begun. In February, 1943, general Stefan Rowecki amended the plan. The Uprising was to be started in three phases, the first being in the East (with main centres of resistance in Lwów and Wilno), before the advancing Red Army. The second part was to include armed struggle in the belt between the Curzon Line and the Vistula river, while the third part was to be a nationwide uprising in all of Poland. Polish-Soviet relations were broken off on April 25, 1943 due to the Katyn massacre, and it became obvious that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General Rowecki put it, \"Our Allies' Ally\". On November 26, 1943 the Polish government in exile issued an instruction to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before their entry to Poland, the Home Army forces were to remain underground until further decisions were made. However, the Home Army commander took a different approach, and on November 30, 1943 the final version of the plan was created. It became known as Operation Tempest. The Warsaw Uprising, or at least some form of insurrection in Poland, had been planned long in advance. Warsaw was chosen, partially, because of its status as a pre-war capital. The allies foresaw that the Germans would wish to hold onto Warsaw for as long as possible, as a tool of morale, communications and supply and troop movement, The Polish government-in-exile strongly wanted support from the other allies. For this reason they carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from their allies prior to the start of battle. Although there were supply drops by American, British and Polish forces prior to, and during the Uprising most fell uselessly into German hands. This left the Polish Home Army forces seriously under supplied. The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of the influence of Polish Government in Exile and as a direct operation against German occupiers. The fear was that in the aftermath of the war the allies would ignore the legal London-based government. It was clear that Poland would be liberated by the Red Army, and that the Soviet Union did not recognise the Government-in-Exile. Initially, after the Red Army forces crossed the pre-war Polish borders, the local Home Army units were engaged in successful cooperation with the Soviets in liberating several towns and cities. However, in most cases after the struggle ended the Polish officers and members of local administration were caught by the NKVD and either shot or sent to Gulags and prisons in Russia. At the same time most of the Polish soldiers caught by the Soviets were given the choice of either joining the Soviet-backed Polish People's Army or sharing the fate of their officers. Nevertheless, the Soviet advance was fast, and the Polish authorities saw no other choice but to continue the struggle against the German forces and aid the Soviets. At the same time the government in London asked the SOE and the Foreign Office several times for an allied mission to Poland to be sent; such missions had already been dispatched to all resistance movements in Europe, including Albania, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Yugoslavia. However, the pleas were not fulfilled until December 1944. The official line of Soviet propaganda was that the Polish underground was \"waiting with their arms at ease\" and was not fighting the common enemy. As the Soviet forces were nearing Warsaw in June and July 1944, the Soviet radio stations demanded a full national uprising in Warsaw to cut the communication lines of the German units still on the right bank of the Vistula. On July 29, 1944 the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw. With the recent flood of reports from the eastern territories about forced demilitarisation, trials and execution of Home Army soldiers by the Soviets, on 21 July 1944 the High Command of the Home Army decided to expand the scope of the Operation Tempest to include Warsaw itself. The date for the Warsaw Uprising was set to 1 August. By the end of July the town had been declared \"Festung Warschau\" (Fortress Warsaw) by the Germans. It was to be defended at all cost against the Soviet offensive. However, the July 20 Plot and the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler made many German units withdraw westward through Warsaw. The Home Army saw it as a sign of defeat of the Germans. The number of German soldiers in the area was lowered significantly. On July 27, the governor of the General Government, Hans Frank called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17–65 to arrive at several concentration places in Warsaw the following day. They were to be employed at construction of fortifications for the Wehrmacht in and around the city. This move was viewed by the Home Army as an attempt to neutralise the underground forces and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it.

It ended with the Polish victory when, after a two-month siege, the Prussian and Russian army ended the siege and withdrew from Warsaw. Warsaw, the capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was one of the key strategic areas for all sides in the Kościuszko Uprising. Secured by the Poles during the Warsaw Uprising in April, it was threatened by the forces of the Imperial Russia and Kingdom of Prussia. The leader of the Uprising, Tadeusz Kościuszko, gathered forces to defend Warsaw, and around 7 to 11 July fought a delaying battle at Raszyn. Kościuszko was able to gain some time to finish preparation for the upcoming siege, dividing his forces into the field army (23,000), garrison (3,000) and city militia (18,000). Another estimate gave him 35,000 men and 200 guns. The field army had a line of field fortifications and trenches prepared outside the main city walls and fortifications. The besieging forces were commanded by King Frederick William II of Prussia, whose army numbered about 25,000 and 179 guns, with a Russian army of about 65,000 and 74 guns under Johann Hermann von Fersen. Another estimate gives the Prussian size at 30,000 and the Russian, at 13,000. The attackers decided to delay their assault, waiting for heavy artillery. They launched their first attack on July 27 in the direction of Wola, but were pushed back by a division under Prince Józef Poniatowski. To relieve the pressure of the siege, Kościuszko ordered the Uprising in Greater Poland, which succeeded in disrupting the Prussian forces. Kościuszko became more radical in his political influence, endorsing the Polish Jacobins to gather more popular support. The second assault by the besieging Prussian and Russian armies on 26 to 28 August was also defeated, and with the spreading of unrest in Greater Poland, Frederick William II ordered his forces to end the siege and withdraw. The Prussians would retreat to the Bzura river, while the Russians, under von Fersen, would camp near the southern Pilica river region. The Polish victory at Warsaw is seen as one of the major accomplishments of Kościuszko, and one of the two greatest Polish victories in the Uprising, second to the success of the Greater Poland Uprising itself, which was inspired by the siege. Despite this victory, the Uprising would soon end with Kościuszko's defeat at the battle of Maciejowice in October followed by the bloody taking of Warsaw in November."]}

The last decades of the 18th century were marked by continual strife between rival claimants to the Peacock Throne. Catherine the Great of Russia took advantage of the disorder to consolidate her control over the weak polities of the Caucasus, which was, for swaths of it, an integral Persian domain. The kingdom of Georgia, a subject of the Persians for many centuries, became a Russian protectorate in 1783, when Erekle II signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, whereby the Empress promised to defend him in case of the Iranian attack. The shamkhals of Tarki followed the lead and accepted Russian protection three years later. With the enthronement of Agha Mohammad Khan as Shah of Persia in 1794 the political climate changed. He put an end to the period of dynastic strife and proceeded to re-strengthen the hold of the Caucasus by re-garrisoning the Iranian territories and cities in what is modern-day Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, as well as ravaging and recapturing Georgia and reducing its capital Tbilisi to a pile of ashes in 1795. Belatedly, Catherine II was determined to mount a punitive expedition against the Shah. The ultimate goal for the Russian government was to topple the anti-Russian shah, and to replace him with a half-brother of Agha Muhammad Khan, namely Morteza Qoli Khan, who had defected to Russia, and was therefore pro-Russian. Although it was widely expected that a 50,000-strong Russian corps would be led by a seasoned general (Gudovich), the Empress followed the advice of her lover, Prince Zubov, and entrusted the command to his youthful brother, Count Valerian Zubov. The Russian troops set out from Kizlyar in April 1796 and stormed the key fortress of Derbent on 10 May. The event was glorified by the court poet Derzhavin in his famous ode; he was later to comment bitterly on Zubov's inglorious return from the expedition in another remarkable poem. By mid-June, Zubov's troops overran without any resistance most of the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan, including three principal cities — Baku, Shemakha and Ganja. By November, they were stationed at the confluence of the Araks and Kura Rivers, poised to attack mainland Iran. It was in that month that the Empress of Russia died and her successor Paul, who detested the Zubovs and had other plans for the army, ordered the troops to retreat back to Russia. This reversal aroused the frustration and enmity of the powerful Zubovs and other officers who took part in the campaign: many of them would be among the conspirators who arranged Paul's murder five years later."], "neg": ["Azov campaigns (1695–96)\nAzov campaigns (1695–96) The Azov campaigns of 1695–96 (, \"Azovskiye Pokhody\"), were two Russian military campaigns during the Russo-Turkish War of 1686–1700, led by Peter the Great and aimed at capturing the Turkish fortress of Azov (garrison - 7,000 men), which had been blocking Russia's access to the Azov Sea and the Black Sea. Since the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689 had failed because of the difficulty of moving a large army across the steppe, Peter decided to try a river approach. The first Azov campaign began in the spring of 1695. Peter the Great ordered his army (31,000 men and 170 guns) to advance towards Azov. The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh. In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries. Between June 27-July 5 the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1. Another Russian army (120,000 men, mostly cavalry, Streltsy, Ukrainian Cossacks and Kalmyks) under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople (1700) the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone. At the end of 1695 the Russians began preparing for the second Azov campaign. By the spring of 1696 they had built a fleet of ships to block Turkish reinforcements for the garrison. The cavalry under the command of Sheremetev (up to 70,000 men) was once again sent to the lower reaches of the Dnieper. From April 23–26 the main forces (75,000 men) under the command of Aleksei Shein started to advance towards Azov by land and water (the rivers of Voronezh and Don). Peter I and his galley fleet left for Azov on May 3. On May 27 the Russian fleet (two ships-of-the-line, four fire ships, 23 galleys and miscellaneous vessels, built at Voronezh and nearby locations) under the command of Lefort reached the sea and blocked Azov. On June 14 the Turkish fleet (23 ships with 4,000 men) appeared at the mouth of the Don. However, it left after having lost two ships in combat. After massive bombardment from land and sea and seizure of the external rampart of the fortress by the Ukrainian and Don Cossacks on July 17, the Azov garrison surrendered on July 19. The Azov campaigns demonstrated the significance of having a fleet and marked the beginning of Russia's becoming a maritime power. Russia's success at Azov strengthened its positions during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698–1699 and favored the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople in 1700. As Azov's harbor was not convenient for the military fleet, the Tsar selected another more appropriate site on July 27, 1696, on the cape Tagan-Rog (Taganrog). On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns. The report also included the request to declare war on the Ottomans, as well as to repay some 300,000 tomans to the Russians, which the report asserted were owed to the Tsar \"since the days of shah Safi\" (r. 1629–1642)."]}
{"query": "Sir Garfield Barwick's judicial career beyond the Parramatta Justice Precinct building.", "pos": ["Garfield Barwick\nGarfield Barwick Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick, (22 June 190313 July 1997) was an Australian judge who was the seventh and longest serving Chief Justice of Australia, in office from 1964 to 1981. He had earlier been a Liberal Party politician, serving as a minister in the Menzies Government from 1958 to 1964. Barwick was born in Sydney, and attended Fort Street High School before going on to study law at the University of Sydney. He was called to the bar in 1927 and became one of Australia's most prominent barristers, appearing in many high-profile cases and frequently before the High Court. He served terms as president of the NSW Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia. Barwick entered politics only at the age of 54, winning election to the House of Representatives at the 1958 Parramatta by-election. Prime Minister Robert Menzies made him Attorney-General by the end of the year, and in 1961 he was additionally made Minister for External Affairs. In 1964, Menzies nominated Barwick as his choice to replace the retiring Owen Dixon as Chief Justice. Over the next 17 years, the Barwick court would decide many significant constitutional cases, including a significant broadening of the corporations power and several cases regarding the constitutional basis of taxation. Barwick also played a small but significant role in the 1975 constitutional crisis, advising Governor-General John Kerr that it was within his powers to sack Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. He retired from the court at the age of 77, but remained a public figure until his death at the age of 94. Outside of his professional career, he also served as the inaugural president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Barwick was one of three brothers born to Methodist parents, of Cornish origin; he would later be very insistent on his Cornish identity. He was raised in Stanmore, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, and attended Fort Street High School. He graduated from the University of Sydney with a University Medal in law. A very diligent student, Barwick was admitted to legal practice soon after finishing university, although (on his own later admission) he suffered severely in financial terms during the Great Depression. He was guarantor for a bank loan to his younger brother to operate a service station in Ashfield, but was unable to repay the bank when the loan was forfeited, and was made bankrupt after he sued the oil companies for defamation. This was held against him by many throughout his career. Nevertheless, he practised as a barrister from 1927 in many jurisdictions, achieving considerable recognition and the reluctant respect of opponents. At the beginning of World War 2, Barwick's challenges to the National Security Act 1939, which centralised the power to the Australian government, propelled him to the front rank of the Bar. He became publicly prominent in the 1943 case over the artistic merits of William Dobell's Archibald Prize-winning portrait of the painter Joshua Smith; a losing entrant claimed the picture was caricature, not portraiture. Barwick represented the plaintiff, and although they lost, the judges commended him for the brilliance of his arguments and his name became well known from that point onwards. Having been briefed in many of Australia's defining constitutional cases (e.g., the Airlines case, and the Bank Nationalisation case), he was knighted in 1953. A famous example of his astute advocacy involved thirteen Malaysians sentenced to death who appealed to the Privy Council. Twelve retained Barwick, who duly found a technical deficiency in the arrest warrants and secured their freedom. The last, whose counsel was not so thorough, was hanged. A member of the Liberal Party, Barwick was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1958 Parramatta by-election, beginning his parliamentary career at the relatively late age of 54. He was re-elected in the general elections of 1958, 1961, and 1963. After the 1958 election, Barwick was promoted to cabinet as Attorney-General, replacing the retiring Neil O'Sullivan. In that position, he guided through legislation amending the \"Matrimonial Causes Act\" and the \"Crimes Act\", and established a model for restrictive trade practices legislation. He also gained public notice for his role in the case of an alleged Estonian war criminal, Ervin Viks, who had settled in Australia and was being pursued by the Soviet Union. Barwick refused to accept the USSR's extradition request, as there was no extradition treaty between the two countries; Viks had passed immigration screening processes and it was argued any such extradition would undermine Australian sovereignty. After the 1961 election, Barwick was additionally made Minister for External Affairs. He led the Australian delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations for its 15th, 17th, and 18th sessions. For some time, Barwick was seen as a likely successor to Robert Menzies as Liberal leader and prime minister. When the news broke that he was entering parliament, Frank Browne confidently wrote: However, Barwick struggled to adapt to the cut and thrust of political life. There were reports that he was reduced to tears by a vitriolic debate over what would become the \"Crimes Act 1959\", which he later confirmed had been accurate. In retirement, Menzies said that he \"didn't understand parliament [...] he was a disappointing politician\". An opinion poll in 1960 found that only three percent of the general public supported him as Menzies' replacement. He had little support from other Liberal MPs, and speculation about his leadership prospects was largely media-driven. Barwick's elevation to the High Court further \"cleared the space\" for Harold Holt, the deputy leader, and he would eventually replace Menzies as leader unopposed in 1966. On 27 April 1964, Barwick was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, succeeding Sir Owen Dixon, being the first law graduate from the University of Sydney to hold this position. He was instrumental in the construction of the High Court building in Canberra (unofficially known, as a result, as \"Gar's Mahal\"), and became the first president of the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1966. Barwick was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court; the others were Edmund Barton, Richard O'Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, and Lionel Murphy. In 1972 he became President of the Australian Institute for International Affairs. He was an \"ad hoc\" judge of the International Court of Justice in 1973–74 in the \"Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France)\" and \"Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France)\" cases, representing Australia and New Zealand jointly. A significant decision of the Barwick court marked the beginning of the modern interpretation of the corporations power, which had been interpreted narrowly since 1909. The Concrete Pipes case (1971) established that the federal parliament could exercise the power to regulate at least the trading activities of corporations, whereas earlier interpretations had allowed only the regulation of conduct or transactions with the public. The court decided many other significant constitutional cases, including the Seas and Submerged Lands case (1975), upholding legislation asserting sovereignty over the territorial sea; the First (1975) and Second (1977) Territory Senators cases, which concerned whether legislation allowing for the mainland territories to be represented in the Parliament of Australia was valid; and \"Russell v Russell\" (1976), which concerned the validity of the \"Family Law Act 1975\". The court also decided several cases relating to the historic 1974 joint sitting of the Parliament of Australia, including \"Cormack v Cope\" (1974) and the Petroleum and Minerals Authority case (1975). The Barwick court decided several infamous cases on tax avoidance and tax evasion, almost always deciding against the taxation office. Led by Barwick himself in most judgments, the court distinguished between avoidance (legitimately minimising one's tax obligations) and evasion (illegally evading obligations). The decisions effectively nullified the anti-avoidance legislation and led to the proliferation of avoidance schemes in the 1970s, a result which drew much criticism upon the court. During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, he controversially, advised Governor-General Sir John Kerr on the constitutional legality of dismissing a prime minister who declined to advise an election when unable to obtain passage of supply. This was significant, because Barwick and Gough Whitlam, whose government Kerr dismissed, had a history of antipathy dating from the mid-1950s. Further, Whitlam had refused Kerr's request for permission to consult Barwick, or to act on any advice except his own. The High Court was due to move to new premises in Canberra in May 1980. A year earlier, in anticipation of the move, Barwick wrote to Malcolm Fraser (who had become prime minister as a result of the dismissal and who was confirmed in office by the December 1975 election), seeking an official residence in the national capital. His request \"went down like a lead balloon with the cabinet which had run into trouble with the High Court's burgeoning costs while urging economic restraint on other Australians\", and was rejected. The $46.5 million High Court building in Canberra was opened by the Queen in May 1980, and is today still referred to as \"Gar's Mahal\". Barwick retired from the bench in 1981, a few months after passing Sir John Latham's record as the longest-serving Chief Justice. He retained excellent health and continued to be active as a much-sought-after expert on legal issues until the end of his life. His writings included \"Sir John Did His Duty\" (a commentary on Kerr's dismissal of Whitlam) and his 1995 memoir \"\". Barwick was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1964 and sat as a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 22 occasions, between 1966, and 1980. Barwick insisted on an amendment to Privy Council procedure to allow dissent, however he exercised that only once. The appeals mostly related to decisions from other Commonwealth countries, although they occasionally included appeals from a State Supreme Court. Barwick supported the passage of the \"Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968\", which closed off appeals from the High Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He said that \"Australia needed to make its own legal mistakes\". However, it remained possible to appeal to the Privy Council from state supreme courts until the passage of the \"Australia Act 1986\". In 1929, Barwick married Norma Symons, with whom he would have one son and one daughter. He was the double cousin of Robert Ellicott, also an Attorney-General, and later Justice of the Federal Court of Australia. On 13 July 1997, aged 94, Barwick died. He was cremated and his ashes interred at Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens. In June 1953, he was made a Knight Bachelor, \"in recognition of service to the Public service\". In January 1965, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), honouring his contribution as Chief Justice of the High Court. In June 1981, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK), \"in recognition of service to the Australian Parliament, government and the law\".", "A Radical Tory: Garfield Barwick's Reflections and Recollections\nA Radical Tory: Garfield Barwick's Reflections and Recollections A Radical Tory: Garfield Barwick's Reflections and Recollections (1995) is an autobiography of Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick, (22 June 190313 July 1997).

The work is divided into four parts covering the various aspects of Barwick's life and career: \"At the Bar\", \"Attorney-General\", \"Minister for External Affairs\" and \"Chief Justice\". Reviewing the book in \"The Canberra Times\" Geoffrey McCarthy noted the worth of such works: \"Perhaps the most absorbing feature of Barwick's account, and in my view its most striking, is his personal recounting of events which for most of us are pure history.\" He went on to conclude: \"No doubt Sir Garfield will always have his detractors, but his place in Australian history is assured and his \"Reflections and Recollections\" give a valuable insight into the man and into the world in which he lived.\"", "Dan Mahoney (politician)\nDan Mahoney (politician) Daniel John Mahoney (25 January 1909 – 11 September 1996) was an Australian politician.

{"query": "Kutch history and economy instead of Bafan community in Kutch", "pos": ["Kutch district\nKutch district Kutch district (Kutchi and Gujarati: કચ્છ જિલ્લો; also spelled as Kachchh) is a district of Gujarat state in western India. Covering an area of 45,674 km², it is the largest district of India. The population of Kutch is about 2,092,000. It has 10 Talukas, 939 villages and 6 Municipalities. The Kutch district is home to the Kutchi people who speak the Kutchi language. Kutch literally means something which intermittently becomes wet and dry; a large part of this district is known as Rann of Kutch which is shallow wetland which submerges in water during the rainy season and becomes dry during other seasons. The same word is also used in Sanskrit origin for a tortoise. The Rann is famous for its marshy salt flats which become snow white after the shallow water dries up each season before the monsoon rains. The district is also famous for ecologically important Banni grasslands with their seasonal marshy wetlands which form the outer belt of the Rann of Kutch. Kutch District is surrounded by the Gulf of Kutch and the Arabian Sea in south and west, while northern and eastern parts are surrounded by the Great and Little Rann (seasonal wetlands) of Kutch. When there were not many dams built on its rivers, the Rann of Kutch remained wetlands for a large part of the year. Even today, the region remains wet for a significant part of year. The district had a population of 2,092,379 as of 2011 census, of which 30% were urban. Motor vehicles registered in Kutch district have their registration Number starting with GJ-12. The district is well connected by road, rail and air. There are four airports in the district: Naliya, Kandla, Mundra, and Bhuj. Bhuj is well connected with Mumbai airport. Being a border district, Kutch has both an army and an airforce base. The history of Kutch can be traced back to prehistorical times. There are several sites related to Indus valley civilization in region and is mentioned in Hindu mythology. In historical times, Kutch is mentioned in Greek writings during Alexander. It was ruled by Menander I of Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which was overthrown by Indo-Scythians followed by Maurya Empire and Sakas. in the first century, it was under Western Satraps followed by Gupta Empire. By fifth century, Maitraka of Valabhi took over from which its close association with ruling clans of Gujarat started. Chavdas ruled the eastern and central parts by seventh century but were came under Chaulukyas by tenth century. After fall of Chaulukya, Vaghelas ruled the state. Following conquest of Sindh by Muslim rulers, Rajput Samma started moving southwards to Kutch and ruled western regions initially. By tenth century, they controlled significant area of Kutch and by thirteenth century they controlled whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, Jadeja. For three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of Jadeja brothers. In sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao Khengarji I of these branches and his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had good relationship with Gujarat Sultanate and Mughals. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II left three sons of whom two died and third son, Pragmal Ji took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of the seventeenth century. The descendants of other brothers founded states in Kathiawar. After turbulent periods and battles with armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of eighteenth century by council known as Bar Bhayat ni Jamat who placed Rao as a titular head and ruled independently. The state accepted suzerainty of British East India Company in 1819 when Kutch was defeated in battle. The state was devastated by an earthquake in 1819. The state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers. Upon the independence of India in 1947, Kutch acceded unto the dominion of India and was constituted an independent commissionaire. It was created a state within the union of India in 1950. The state witnessed an earthquake in 1956. On 1 November 1956, Kutch State was merged with Bombay state, which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, with Kutch becoming part of Gujarat state as Kutch district. The district was affected by tropical cyclone in 1998 and the earthquake in 2001. The state saw rapid industrialization and growth in tourism in subsequent years. Kutch District, at , is the largest district in India. The administrative headquarters is in Bhuj which is geographically in the center of district. Other main towns are Gandhidham, Rapar, Nakhatrana, Anjar, Mandvi, Madhapar, Mundra and Bhachau. Kutch has 969 villages. Kala Dungar (Black Hill) is the highest point in Kutch at . Kutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in the west; the Gulf of Kutch in south and southeast and Rann of Kutch in north and northeast. The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the Sir Creek. The Kutch peninsula is an example of active fold and thrust tectonism. In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized by fault propagation folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently dipping southern limbs. From the gradual increasing dimension of the linear chain of hillocks towards the west along the Kutch mainland fault and the epicentre of the earthquake of 2001 lying at the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault, it is suggested that the eastern part of the Kutch mainland fault is progressively emerging upward. It can be suggested from the absence of distinct surface rupture both during the 1956 Anjar earthquake and 2001 Bhuj earthquake, that movements have taken place along a blind thrust. Villages situated on the blind thrust in the eastern part of the Kutch mainland hill range (viz. Jawaharnagar, Khirsara, Devisar, Amarsar and Bandhdi) were completely erased during the 2001 earthquake. There are ninety-seven small rivers in Kutch District, most of which flow into the Arabian Sea, but some of which feed the Rann of Kutch. Twenty major dams, and numerous smaller dams, capture the rainy season runoff. While most of these dams do not affect the Ranns, as they are on rivers that feed directly into the Arabian Sea, storage of rainy season water upstream from Kutch and its use in irrigation has resulted in less fresh water coming into the Ranns of Kutch during the rainy season. This is true of the Great Rann, but particularly true of the Little Rann which is fed by the Luni, Rupen, the Bambhan, the Malwan, the Kankawati, and the Saraswati rivers. However sea water from the Arabian Sea still continues to be driven into the Great Rann by storm tides aided by high winds. Water remains a serious issue in Kutch. Kutch's thirst for water is satisfied by Narmada river flowing from Sardar Sarovar dam. The Kutch is divided into four zones, namely (a)Wagad (Regional including Rapar and Bhachau Taluka and Little Rann),(b) Kanthi(Sea Coast area, derived from Gujarati:કાંઠો) comprising Anjar Mundra and Mandvi Taluka, (c) Banni Region with Pascham which includes Bhuj, Nakhatrana and surrounding areas and (d) Maghpat which includes part of Nakhatrana and Lakhapat taluka.  Under the Kutch princely state, Kutch was divided into Bani, Abdaso, Anjar, Banni, Bhuvad Chovisi, Garado, Halar Chovisi, Kand, Kantho, Khadir, Modaso, Pranthal, Prawar, and Vagad. Kutch District is divided into ten talukas: Abdasa (Abdasa-Nalia), Anjar, Bhachau, Bhuj, Gandhidham, Lakhpat, Mandvi, Mundra, Nakhatrana, and Rapar. From the city Bhuj various ecologically rich and wildlife conservation areas of the Kutch district can be visited such as Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary, Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary, Banni Grasslands Reserve and Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve. According to the 2011 census Kutch District has a population of 2,090,313, roughly equal to the nation of Macedonia or the US state of New Mexico. This gives it a ranking of 217th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 32.16%. Kutch has a sex ratio of 908 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 71.58%. Higher education in Kutch is regulated by Kachchh University since 2003. About 43 colleges in total are affiliated to the university, offering courses in Humanities, Science, Commerce, Medicine, Nursing, Education and Computing Science. Professional courses in Engineering, Pharmacy and Management are regulated through the Gujarat Technological University. The language spoken predominantly in the Kutch district is Kutchi language, Sindhi and Gujarati. The script of the Kutchi language has become extinct. It is now mainly written in the Gujarati script. Samples of Kutch script are available in the Kutch Museum. The increased use of Gujarati language is mainly because of its being a medium of instruction in schools. Kutch district is inhabited by various groups and communities. One can find various nomadic, semi nomadic and artisan groups living in Kutch. Gujarati Ahirs constitute a comparatively large group in Kutch. The majority of the population is Hindu and Jain and thus largely vegetarian. Jains also refrain from eating \"kandmool\" food grown below the ground such as potatoes, garlic, onion, and yam. There are also a sizeable population of Muslims, who eat vegetables, chicken, mutton and occasionally camels. In the villages, staple foods include kadi-khichdi, bajra and milk ; bajara na rotla with curd and buttermilk is very common food for all the Gujarati people. Bajra was introduced by a king of this region named Lakho Fulani. During his period of exile, he came to know about this grain in some tribal regions. They also extensively drink buttermilk during lunch. Milk is considered to be sacred food and offering it to somebody is considered a gesture of friendship and welcoming. Settlement of dispute invariably follows offering milk to each other as a concluding remark. In the Kutchi engagement ceremony, the bride's family offers milk to the groom's relatives as a symbol of accepting their relationship. Tea is the most popular drink in this region and is enjoyed widely. Historically Kutch was always considered a backward region due to its location and submerged geography. The situation seemed to have worsened after the disastrous Kutch earthquake. But in the next decade, the economy took an almost miraclous jumpstart due to the intense efforts of the Gujarat government. Kutch today is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India's fastest growing states - Gujarat. Its location on the far western edge of India has resulted in the commissioning of two major ports Kandla and Mundra. These ports are near most to the Gulf and Europe by the sea route. The hinterland of north-western India hosts more than 50% of India's population. Quality of roads is good in Kutch. The large part of the growth of Kutch came after intense development by the state government as part of 2001 earthquake relief. Due to the existence of two major ports i.e. Kandla and Mundra transportation as a business has thrived. Since historical times the people of Kutch have formed the backbone of trade between Gujarat mainland and Sindh. After the formation of Pakistan this trade stopped for good, but due to the inception of the Kandla port, trade boomed again. Kandla port is also in Kutch. It is considered Gateway to India's North. It is managed by the Kandla Port trust. Kutch is a mineral rich region with a very large reserve of Lignite, Bauxite, Gypsum and other minerals. Kutch received tax break for industries for 15 years after the major earthquake on 26 January 2001. Lignite is mined only by Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC) at its two mines in Panandhro and Mata no Madh. The Panandaro mines has now been reserved for GEB and GMDC power plants and GMDC has stopped supplying other industries from there. Kutch also houses cement plants Gujarat Anjan Cement Limited promoted by infrastructure conglomerate Anjan Group and Sanghi Industries Ltd's promoted by Sanghi Group . The companies are now planning to increase the capacity at Abdasa location from 3–9 million tons per annum. By 2015, the company plans to produce 20 million tons. Other major Industries in Kutch are Tata Power's first 4000 MW Ultra Mega Power Project (UMPP) of India. Adani Power expects to tie up funds for its 3300 MW plant by March 2012 and is on track to complete the installation of 10,000 MW projects by 2013. Kutch district has a scanty forest cover. Hence there is negligible risk of illegal cutting of forests. This coupled with the adequate facilities available at Kandla port has helped establish the timber market. In 1987, \"Kandla Timber Association\" was formed in order to resolve the specific problems of timber importers and timber allied industries coming up during the period. The timber industry is growing at a faster pace with 300 saw mills working in Gandhidham-Kandla Complex. The Little Rann of Kutch is known for its traditional salt production and various references mention this to be a 600-year-old activity. During the British period, this activity increased manifold. It was used to fund a substantial part of the military expenses of the British government. Communities involved in salt production are mainly Chunvaliya Koli, Ahir and Miyana (Muslim), residing in 107 villages in the periphery of Lesser Rann of Kutch. These communities are traditionally known to have the skills of salt production and are known as ‘Agariyas’. Water quality in 107 villages of Lesser Rann of Kutch is saline, thus agriculture is not an option. Hence salt production is the only livelihood option for Agariyas. As per the Salt Commission’s report there are 45000 Agariyas working in the salt pans of Kutch. Out of the estimated total annual production of India of about 180 lakh tonnes, Gujarat contributes 75% - mainly from Kutch and other parts of Saurashtra. Kutch is one of the most prolific regions in India in the area of textile art. Kutch embroidery is dense with motifs and is one of the most beautiful forms of textile art. A variation with mirrors sewn into the embroidery is one of the signature arts of this region. Within the category of Kutch embroidery there are several sub-categories as each tribe and sub-tribe produces a unique signature form of art. Kutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch. A related Sarswat Brahmin are called Kutchi Sarswat Brahmin. Maheshwari (Maheshpanthi) Shampraday. Many kutchis follow Jainism.As per the 2011 census, the district's population was 2,092,371.  J. P. Dutta's Bollywood film \"Refugee\" is shot on location in the Great Rann of Kutch and other locations in the Kutch district of Gujarat, India. This film is attributed to have been inspired by the famous story by Keki N. Daruwalla based around the Great Rann of Kutch titled \"Love Across the Salt Desert\" which is also included as one of the short stories in the School Standard XII syllabus English text book of NCERT in India. The film crew having traveled from Mumbai was based at the city of Bhuj and majority of the film shooting took place in various locations around in the Kutch District of the Indian state of Gujarat including the Great Rann of Kutch (also on BSF controlled \"snow white\" Rann within), Villages and Border Security Force (BSF) Posts in Banni grasslands and the Rann, Tera fort village, Lakhpat fort village, Khera fort village, a village in southern Kutch, some ancient temples of Kutch and with parts and a song filmed on set in Mumbai's Kamalistan Studio. Just after the film shooting of \"Refugee\" finished, the film crew of another Bollywood film \"Lagaan\" descended on Bhuj in Kutch and shot the entire film in the region, employing local people and villagers from miles around. A set of a full period Village was constructed for the film with typical Kutch style mud houses or huts with thatched straw roofs called \"boongas\".

Kutchi Memons have this unique surname SAIT (for men) and BAI (for women).Of course there are Saits among Punjabis too. Bai is a common appellation in northern India for women in high position ege.g. Rani Lakshmi Bai. The first families that migrated, initially, to Travancore (now central and south Kerala)were called Sett, a vulgarisation of the appellation Seth or Saith - rich man- by the Tamil oriented Travancoreans. The title got further skewed, phonetically, by the Turkish oriented Pathans then in administration to Sait (one can find Saits in Turkey). Sait ten became a surname for them and their children. They spread from Travancore to other States, though a few families joined them directly from Kutchch afterwards.After independence many families migrated from Kutchch to Pakistan; but migration from South India was very very insignificant, and whoever migrated retained the title Sait and are understood to be migrants via South. Kutchi Memons have mostly been in business, ranging from large trading houses down to road side hawkers, but with the new generation this trend is changing.The community has a very modern outlook and most individuals are educated. The community is very peculiar about its unique identity and in some pockets marriage outside the community is still looked upon unkindly, though in Kerala nearly 95 % of Memons can no longer claim pure blood - at least three generations have crossed with native Muslims. The written Language had been Gujarathi for long, migrants into TamilnaduTamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra speak Urdu but it is slowly changing from Urdu to regional languages; change to Malayalam in Kerala is practically complete though Kutchi is still understood by a sizeable population. The local languages are used for written communication even among members of the clan in Kerala and Urdu in other states. The size of the population cannot be determined due to its lack of concentration but estimations would put their number close to 0.5 million people. The community follows all the basic Sunni-Hanafi path Islamic tradition but with somewhat different practices remnant of the old Kutchi traditions modified by local customs."], "neg": ["Bakawan\nBakawan Bakawan is a village in the state of Madhya Pradesh located on the banks of the river Narmada in India.

Miller was born in Pasadena, California but grew up in nearby Whittier. He has developed shows based on his personal life as a gay man and as an activist. A member of ACT UP and other campaigning organizations, Miller has participated in numerous demonstrations to call for funding of AIDS research and treatment and to promote equal rights. His civil disobedience has led to his arrest on several occasions. Miller's interest in performance began in high school, where he took classes in theater and dance. He played the lead role of John Proctor in Lowell High School's production of \"The Crucible\" by Arthur Miller. At nineteen he moved to New York and studied dance with Merce Cunningham. In 1980 Miller joined with Charles Moulton, Peter Rose and Charles Dennis to found P.S. 122, a space for performance art. The name derives from the former school building that houses the project. In 1987 Miller returned to California and with Linda Frye Burnham founded another performance space, Highways, in Santa Monica. In 1993 Miller was featured in the episode of \"The Larry Sanders Show\" called \"The Performance Artist\". He played himself as the titular performance artist, who appears as a guest both on Larry Sanders' show and on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno performing a portion of \"My Queer Body\". In 1997 Miller published \"Shirts & Skin\", a compilation of personal stories that he had told in his shows over the previous decade. He also launched a show of the same name. Miller took on a new topic, immigration rights for gay and lesbian partners of American citizens, in \"Glory Box\" (1999). The immigration issue is a personal cause as Alistair McCartney, his partner since 1994, is Australian. In 2002 Miller published \"Body Blows\", a collection of scripts from six of his shows with associated essays. Miller returned to the theme of the problems of Americans with same-sex life partners in \"Us\" in 2003.

He was known for breaking with existing literary forms and developing a new type of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, stream of consciousness, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism. His most characteristic works of this kind are \"Tropic of Cancer\", \"Black Spring\", \"Tropic of Capricorn\" and \"The Rosy Crucifixion\" trilogy, which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (all of which were banned in the United States until 1961). He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors. Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller. As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg. As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his \"quondam idol\" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison). He attended the City College of New York for one semester. Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917; their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923. Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919. They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, \"Clipped Wings\". It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as \"Tropic of Capricorn\". A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called \"Clipped Wings\" \"a long book and probably a very bad one.\" In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time. They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924. In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing. Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy \"The Rosy Crucifixion\". Miller's second novel, \"\", was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June. A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers. The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller's death. \"Moloch\" is based on Miller's first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan. A third novel written around this time, \"Crazy Cock\", also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled \"Lovely Lesbians\", \"Crazy Cock\" (along with his later novel \"Nexus\") told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later. Kronski committed suicide around 1930. In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman. One day on a Paris street, Miller met another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: \"Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine.\" In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied. Soon after, he began work on \"Tropic of Cancer\", writing to a friend, \"I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!\" Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change after meeting Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of \"Tropic of Cancer\" in 1934 with money from Otto Rank. She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966. Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City. In 1931, Miller was employed by the \"Chicago Tribune\" Paris edition as a proofreader, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat. At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books. During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists. His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, \"Tropic of Cancer\" (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity. The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: \"Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain.\" He continued to write novels that were banned; along with \"Tropic of Cancer\", his \"Black Spring\" (1936) and \"Tropic of Capricorn\" (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published \"The Cosmological Eye\", Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in \"Black Spring\" and \"Max and the White Phagocytes\" (1938). Miller lived in France until June 1939. In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in \"The Colossus of Maroussi\" (1941), which he considered his best book. One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay \"Inside the Whale\", where he wrote: Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses. In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for \"The Air-Conditioned Nightmare\", he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944. While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the \"Tropic\" books, then still banned in the USA, were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for. By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image. In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing \"Sexus\", the first novel in \"The Rosy Crucifixion\" trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer. Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan. In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in \"Sunday After The War\" (1944) and \"The Air-Conditioned Nightmare\" (1945). His \"Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch\", published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur. In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior. They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine. They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960, and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism. In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of \"The Rosy Crucifixion\" trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's \"terrible\" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally. In 1959, Miller wrote a short story which he called his \"most singular story.\" It is truly a work of fiction entitled \"The Smile At the Foot of the Ladder\". In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life. In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Japanese born singer Hoki Tokuda (). In 1968, Miller signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats. Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011. Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook \"On Turning Eighty\" were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the \"Yes! Capra\" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length. The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains: If at eighty you're not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin' and keepin' power. Miller and Tokuda divorced in 1977. Then in his late 80s, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film \"Reds\", which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of \"witnesses.\" The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death. During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young \"Playboy\" playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986. Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88. His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur. The publication of Miller's \"Tropic of Cancer\" in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in \"Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein\", citing \"Jacobellis v.

Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published. Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: \"Black Spring\", \"Tropic of Capricorn\", \"Quiet Days in Clichy\", \"Sexus\", \"Plexus\" and \"Nexus\". Excerpts from some of these banned books, including \"Tropic of Cancer\", \"Black Spring\" and \"Sexus\", were first published in the US by New Directions in \"The Henry Miller Reader\" in 1959. In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller's paintings exist. The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors, as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001. Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005. He was also an amateur pianist. Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections: Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981. This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers. Miller is considered a \"literary innovator\" in whose works \"actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other.\" His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong. Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him. \"Tropic of Cancer\" is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, \"Tropic of Cancer\" and \"Tropic of Capricorn\" are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel \"Tree of Smoke\", in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands.

These towns emerged in a number of states, most notably in Texas. The Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment brought 4 million people out of slavery in the defunct Confederate States of America. Many were faced with the questions of where they would go, what they would eat and how they would survive. Many decided to remain on plantations working as sharecroppers. Many freedmen migrated from white areas to build their own towns away from white supervision. They also created their own churches and civic organizations. Freedmen’s settlements had a greater measure of protection from the direct effects of Jim Crow. \"Such places were defensive communities, where black property owners had circled the wagons against outsiders—a “fortress without walls.” Freedmen’s settlements were black enclaves that kept to themselves and until the end of Jim Crow few whites wished—or dared—to live there,” Thad Sitton and James H. Conrad chronicled in their book, Freedom Colonies: Independent Black Texans in the time of Jim Crow. Education was of the highest priority for the residents of freedmen towns.They started schools, which both adults and children attended to learn to read and write. By 1915 schools built in the Freedmen's settlements were mostly small frame one or two room structures. Textbooks for the schools were typically donated from white schools, but often they were in poor condition. Teachers were very serious about discipline which was strictly enforced by eg. switching students with a brush, or making them stand in a corner on one leg. To provide help in education and managing the transition of the people to freedom, including negotiation of labor contracts and establishing the Freedmen's Bank, President Abraham Lincoln created the Freedmen's Bureau. In 1865 Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was looking for an Army officer to run the Freedmen's Bureau. General Ulysses S. Grant proposed General John Eaton, a Chaplin with an established reputation as a humanitarian, and who had authority over Black refugees after the Civil War. However, the position of Bureau commissioner went to another Christian General and Civil War veteran, General Oliver Otis Howard, whose close associations to Freedmen's aid societies had earned him the title of \"Christian General\". The Bureau was largely staffed ny ex-union officers who distributed food to needy Blacks and Whites. They supervised the establishment of free-labor agriculture and provided needed funding to set up schools for ex-slaves, however, some were suspected of collaborating with planters to enforce repressive regulations, or to ignore the cheating of Blacks. Some southern Whites suspected the Bureau of being part of a conspiracy to undermine relations between Blacks and Whites in the south by agitating Blacks against those whites who had their true interests at heart. Both freed people and planters, however, turned to the Bureau for help, which the agency did provide regardless of any plans by individuals to undermine their efforts. The Freedman's Bureau was created by the \"American Freedman's Inquiry Commission\", which created by the War Department in 1863 to advance methods to deal with emancipated slaves. It was created by three life long abolitionists, Robert Dale Owen, James McKaye and Samuel Gridley, who visited the south and gathered testimony from Blacks and Whites. They authored two joint reports and many accounts of individual observations. After taking office, President Andrew Johnson vetoed the re-authorization and funding of the bureau in February 1866 during Reconstruction.

It organized a supply of teachers from the North and provided housing for them, to set up and teach in schools in the South for freedmen and their children. The AMA founded a total of more than 500 schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the war, so that freedmen could be educated as teachers, nurses and other professionals. The work of the Society accelerated with the end of the war and the beginning of the Reconstruction era. Education for freedmen was seen as a top priority among both blacks and whites. The Society was supported by a variety of religious groups and denominations, and it began work in the South three months after organizing. By the end of the first year, it had recruited 52 instructors. The teachers instructed more than 5,000 students in 59 schools. The schools were open to men, women, and children in the South. By the turn of the century, blacks had raised their rate of literacy by an amazing amount; it was a major success story since the end of the war. By then the Democratic-dominated state legislatures had imposed racial segregation and were underfunding black schools and other facilities. Leadership and control of the Freedmen's Aid Society has been attributed to both the Congregational and the Methodist Episcopal churches. The Methodist version of the Society's history states that it was founded in 1866. It was \"directed by a Board of Managers who were elected by the (Methodist) General Conference.\" In 1920 it was reorganized and renamed the Board of Education for Negroes, and in 1939 absorbed into the Board of Education of the Methodist Church."]}

Having previously held the NYAC Spring and Fall Games, the seventh edition of the Fall Games became the country's first national track and field championships.

It is the first Philippine entry to be officially selected in the International Competition of the short film section of the Berlin International Film Festival.

At the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, however, it was given the German title \"Zerstörtes Herz!\". \"Ruined Heart!\" is the classic love story between a gangster and a prostitute, but Khavn \"deconstructs this often recounted tale to explore in fleeting images the likelihood of dying too early from the violence so omnipresent in the Philippines today\". \"Ruined Heart!\" was filmed in 24 hours, in six different places in Metro Manila. The main location was the filmmaker's residence in Kamias Road.

Union Films' first production, it was directed by Jo An Djan. Starring Basoeki Resobowo, Fatimah, and Oedjang, the film follows a young couple who fight off criminals with the help of a masked man. Advertised as an \"Indonesian cocktail of violent actions ... and sweet romance\", \"Kedok Ketawa\" received positive reviews, particularly for its cinematography. Following the success of the film, Union produced another six works before being shut down in early 1942 during the Japanese occupation. The film, screened until at least August 1944, may be lost. In Cibodas, Banten, a young woman named Minarsih (Fatimah) is rescued from four thugs by the painter Basuki (Basoeki Resobowo). They fall in love and begin planning their life together. However, a rich man interested in taking Minarsih to be his wife sends a gang to kidnap her. Basuki is unable to repel them, but is soon joined by a masked vigilante known only as \"The Laughing Mask\" (Oedjang), who has almost supernatural fighting abilities. After two battles with the gang, Basuki and The Laughing Mask are victorious. Basuki and Minarsih can live together in peace. \"Kedok Ketawa\" was the first film produced by Union Films, one of four new production houses established after the success of Albert Balink's \"Terang Boelan\" revived the ailing motion picture industry of the Dutch East Indies. Union was headquartered in Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta) and funded by the ethnic Chinese businessman Ang Hock Liem, although Tjoa Ma Tjoen was in charge of day-to-day operations. The film was shot on location in Cibodas, and featured fighting, comedy, and singing. The movie was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. Other members of the cast included S Poniman and Eddy Kock. Oedjang had been a stage actor before appearing in the film, while Fatimah and Basoeki were nobles with a formal education. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this is evidence the picture was targeted at intellectual audiences, a manifestation of Union's stated goal of \"improv[ing] the quality of Indonesian art\". Following the success of \"Terang Boelan\" (1937; based on \"The Jungle Princess\"), the domestic movie-making industry began to model their productions after Hollywood works, as this was expected to ensure financial success. The Indonesian film scholars Ekky Imanjaya and Said Salim write that \"Kedok Ketawa\" was influenced by Bram Stoker's 1897 novel \"Dracula\" through its Hollywood adaptations. Neither writer gives comparisons to illustrate this influence. \"Kedok Ketawa\" was not the first contemporary film featuring a masked hero. Tan's Film had released \"Gagak Item\" (\"The Black Crow\"), with Rd Mochtar as the masked Black Crow, in 1939, and later productions, including Java Industrial Film's \"Srigala Item\" (\"The Black Wolf\"; 1941), continued the trend. As was common for contemporary productions, the soundtrack for \"Kedok Ketawa\" – performed by Poniman – consisted of \"kroncong\" songs. \"Kedok Ketawa\" was released in Batavia in July 1940, with a press screening on 20 July. By September it was being shown in Surabaya. In some newspaper advertisements, such as in \"Pemandangan\", it was referred to as \"Pendekar dari Preanger\" (\"Warrior from Preanger\"), while in others it was advertised with the Dutch title \"Het Lachende Masker\". It was marketed as an \"Indonesian cocktail of violent actions ... and sweet romance\" and rated for all ages. The critic and screenwriter Saeroen, writing for \"Pemandangan\", praised \"Kedok Ketawa\", especially its cinematography and the beauty of its scenery; he compared the film to imported Hollywood films. An anonymous review in \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\" found that the film was a mix of native and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but it was evident that this was a first production. Another review, in \"Soerabaijasch Handelsblad\", considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the quality of its cinematography and acting. Soon after the success of \"Kedok Ketawa\", Saeroen joined Union Films and wrote four films for the company. These were not directed by Jo An Djan, who left Union for the competitor Populair's Film, but by the newly hired R Hu and Rd Ariffien. Union Film ultimately produced a total of seven films in 1940 and 1941 before being closed following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. Of the film's main cast, only Fatimah and Oedjang are recorded as continuing their acting career, both appearing in several further Union productions. However, in the 1950s Resobowo continued his career behind the screen, serving as art director of such films as \"Darah dan Doa\" (\"The Long March\"; 1950). \"Kedok Ketawa\" was screened as late as August 1944, but may be a lost film. Contemporary films were shot on unstable and flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. While the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost, J.B. Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that some Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service."]}

The location may be interior or exterior. The filming location may be the same in which the story is set (for example, scenes in the film \"The Interpreter\" were set and shot inside the United Nations building), or it may stand in for a different locale (the films \"Amadeus\" and \"The Illusionist\" were primarily set in Vienna, but were filmed in Prague). Most films feature a combination of location and studio shoots; often, interior scenes will be shot on a soundstage while exterior scenes will be shot on location. Second unit photography is not generally considered a location shoot. Before filming, the locations are generally surveyed in pre-production, a process known as location scouting and recce.  Location shooting has several advantages over filming on a studio set. First and foremost, the expense can often be far lower than that of constructing sets in a studio. The illusion of reality can also be stronger; on a set, it is hard to replicate real-world wear and tear, as well as architectural details, and the vastness of a city is difficult to recreate on a backlot. Shooting outside of the home country is sometimes used to bypass union rules, labor regulations, or work stoppages. It can also allow \"frozen\" currency to be used: the 1968 movie \"Kelly's Heroes\" was filmed in Yugoslavia using profits that had been made on movie exhibitions in that country but could not be exported. Conversely, there are a number of reasons why a production may choose not to shoot on location. Shooting on a set gives the crew a greater control over the environment: a room may be created to the exacting specifications of the story, for example, and there is no need to shut down street traffic when shooting on a backlot. Additionally, a given location may have inconvenient restrictions. The convenience store where \"Clerks\" was shot was open during the day, so the crew could only shoot at night; this necessitated the shutters on the windows be closed to hide the fact that it was dark outside. Location shooting often takes place close to the studio; in Hollywood films, this region is delineated in union agreements and is known as the studio zone. Many location shoots, however, are far from the home studio, sometimes on the other side of the world. In these instances, location shooting can provide significant economic development benefits to the area in which they are shot. Cast and crew heavily rely upon local facilities such as catering, transportation, and accommodations. A film that becomes a blockbuster hit can introduce movie audiences around the world to a visually breathtaking location that they were previously unaware of, as the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy did for New Zealand. This can boost tourism for years or even decades. Location shooting usually requires a location manager, and locations are usually chosen by a location scout. Many popular locations, such as New York City in the United States, Toronto in Canada, and the Isle of Man in the United Kingdom, have dedicated film offices to encourage location shooting, and to suggest appropriate locations to film-makers. In many cases a second unit is dispatched to film on location, with a second unit director and sometimes with stand-in actors. These shots can then be edited into the final film or TV program alongside studio-shot sequences, to give an authentic flavor, without the expense or trouble of a full-scale location shoot. \"NYPD Blue\", for example, was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, but used second unit footage of New York City for color, as well as featuring a small number of episodes filmed on location with the cast."]}

The plateau overlaps the reservations of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes. Controversy arose from an unusually generous mineral lease agreement negotiated under questionable circumstances between the Tribes and Peabody Energy, the coal company's use and degradation of a potable source of water to transport coal via a pipeline from the mine to a power plant hundreds of miles away, and the public health and environmental impacts of strip mining on tribal lands. In 1964, Peabody Energy (then Peabody Western Coal), a publicly traded energy company based in the Midwestern United States, signed a contract with the Navajo Tribe and two years later with the Hopi Tribe, allowing the company mineral rights and use of an aquifer. The contract was negotiated by prominent natural resources attorney John Sterling Boyden, who claimed to be representing the Hopi Tribe while actually on the payroll of Peabody. It offered unusually advantageous terms for Peabody and was approved despite widespread opposition. The contract is also controversial because of misrepresentations made to the Hopi and Navajo tribes. Peabody Energy developed two coal strip mines on the Black Mesa reservation: the Black Mesa Mine and the Kayenta Mine. Peabody Energy pumps water from the underground Navajo Aquifer for washing coal, and, until 2005, in a slurry pipeline operation to transport extracted coal to the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada. With the pipeline operating, Peabody pumped, on average, 3 million gallons of water from the Navajo Aquifer every day. The aquifer is the main source of potable groundwater for the Navajo and Hopi tribes, who use the water for farming and livestock maintenance as well as drinking and other domestic uses. The tribes have alleged that the pumping of water by Peabody Energy has caused a severe decline in potable water and the number of springs. Both tribes, situated in an arid semi-desert, attach religious significance to water, considering it sacred, and have cultural, religious, and practical objections to over-use of water. Peabody's Black Mesa Mine used the slurry to pump its coal through pipes away, where the coal could be filtered and used in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada (which was shut down in 2005). The generating station produces energy for the southern parts of Arizona, California and Nevada. This was the only coal slurry operation in the country and only plant that used groundwater in such a way. Coal from the Kayenta mine goes on a conveyor belt to a silo where it is then shipped to the Navajo Generating Station coal plant. The Black Mesa Mine's last day of operation was December 31, 2005. The Office of Surface Mining approved Peabody's permit request to continue operations at the mine on 22 December 2008. However, in January 2010, an administrative law judge, on appeal of that approval, decided that the Final EIS did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act because it did not take into account changed conditions, and vacated the approval. Operations at the Kayenta Mine continue today. As of April 2018 the mine is preparing to begin operations. Another controversy is their environmental impact on the native wildlife in the area. In this area wild horses have roamed free for centuries if not for thousands of years. During the mines operations Peabody has our government round up these horses and send them to the Peabody owned and operated auction houses in other states. This last occurred winter of 2018. These wild horses fell through the loophole of the 1971 Wild Horse and Burro Act in that they are on Tribal lands without protections. Even though the tribe has actively stated they want the horses and burro to stay they are ignored. The tribe does not have the option to do bait trap, relocate or manage the adoption of these horses and burro. Other wildlife such as elk are also treated as unregulated if on the mines area. Peabody has agreements whether legal or not with government officials that trump the public and tribal wishes when it comes to wildlife.", "Navajo, New Mexico\nNavajo, New Mexico Navajo () is a census-designated place (CDP) in McKinley County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 2,097 at the 2000 census. Navajo is the most Navajo town in the United States, with 95.04% of residents having full or partial Navajo ancestry. Navajo is located at (35.905617, -109.028733). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. To the east of Navajo is Assayi Lake, and just north of Navajo is Red Lake, Wheatfields Lake, and Tsaile Lake. There is an old existing strata volcano, Fuzzy Mountain, which in the winter gives radial sources of water to the environment. The area is rich with culture and traditions. Many of the water resources around Navajo leave the evidence of rushing streams and washes. The evergreen trees offer shading to many of the animals in the summer and provide shelter in the winter. Navajo had employed many Navajos at the sawmill, N.F.P.I. (Navajo Forest Products Industry). The mill has since gone out of business and left Navajo to struggle in the economic development. Many of the people left the Navajo area to relocate to places that had jobs readily available. Today the mill stands alone and empty. Still, Navajo exists because of the schools, the hometown market, the gas station, and the homes. As of the census of 2000, there were 2,097 people, 475 households, and 406 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 928.1 people per square mile (358.3/km²). There were 560 housing units at an average density of 247.8 per square mile (95.7/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.42% Native American, 2.86% White, 0.48% from two or more races, and 0.24% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.62% of the population. There were 475 households out of which 68.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.6% were married couples living together, 37.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 14.5% were non-families. 12.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 0.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.41 and the average family size was 4.81. In the CDP, the population was spread out with 51.9% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 10.5% from 45 to 64, and 2.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 17 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 78.4 males. The median income for a household in the CDP was $14,688, and the median income for a family was $12,569. Males had a median income of $21,518 versus $24,083 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $4,551. About 64.0% of families and 67.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 76.0% of those under age 18 and 63.9% of those age 65 or over."], "neg": ["Nacirema\nNacirema Nacirema (\"American\" spelled backwards) is a term used in anthropology and sociology in relation to aspects of the behavior and society of citizens of the United States of America. The neologism attempts to create a deliberate sense of self-distancing in order that American anthropologists might look at their own culture more objectively. The original use of the term in a social science context was in \"Body Ritual among the Nacirema\", which satirizes anthropological papers on \"other\" cultures, and the culture of the United States. Horace Mitchell Miner wrote the paper and originally published it in the June 1956 edition of \"American Anthropologist\". In the paper, Miner describes the Nacirema, a little-known tribe living in North America. The way in which he writes about the curious practices that this group performs distances readers from the fact that the North American group described actually corresponds to modern-day Americans of the mid-1950s. The article sometimes serves as a demonstration of a gestalt shift with relation to sociology. Miner presents the Nacirema as a group living in the territory between the Canadian Cree, the Yaqui and Tarahumare of Mexico, and the Carib and Arawak of the Antilles. The paper describes the typical Western ideal for oral cleanliness, as well as providing an outside view on hospital care and on psychiatry. The Nacirema are described as having a highly developed market economy that has evolved within a rich natural habit. Miner's article became a popular work, reprinted in many introductory textbooks and used as an example process analysis in the literature text \"The Bedford Reader\". The article itself received the most reprint permission requests of any article in \"American Anthropologist\", but has become part of the public domain. Some of the popular aspects of Nacirema culture include: medicine men and women (doctors, psychiatrists, and pharmacists), a charm-box (medicine cabinet), the mouth-rite ritual (brushing teeth), and a cultural hero known as Notgnihsaw (Washington spelled backwards). These ritual practices are prescribed as how man should comport himself in the presence of sacred things. These sacred aspects are the rituals that the Nacirema partake in throughout their lives. In 1972 Neil B. Thompson revisited the Nacirema after the fall of their civilization. Thompson's paper, unlike Miner's, primarily offered a social commentary focused on environmental issues. Thompson paid special attention to the Elibomotua cult and its efforts to modify the environment. This article is reprinted and appears as the final chapter in an anthology called \"Nacirema: Readings on American Culture\". The volume contains an array of scholarly investigations into American social anthropology as well as one more article in the \"Nacirema\" series, by Willard Walker of Wesleyan University: (American Anthropologist, Volume 72, Issue 1, pages 102–105, February 1970) \"The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the TI'YCIR Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture.\" This article laments the corrosive and subjugating ritual of attending \"sguwlz\". On phonology, the anthropologist notes: This refers to the conceptualization of the English vowel system based on orthography (with \"5\" vowels), which is in stark contrast to the actual system (with nine vowels and several diphthongs). Gerry Philipsen (1992) studies what he terms \"speech codes\" among the Nacirema, which he contrasts with the speech codes of another semi-fictionalized group of Americans, the inhabitants of Teamsterville culture. His Nacirema comprises primarily middle-class west-coast Americans.  Nacirema is the name of a fictional country in Ronald M. Green's role-playing game aimed at explaining to undergraduate students the fundamentals of John Rawls's theory of justice as fairness. In \"The Rawls Game\" (1986), Green asks the students to take on the role of Nacireman citizens. Acting from unrestrained self-interest, the citizens vote on a series of public issues and attempt to find solutions that do not require anyone to be forced to act against their own will. The goal of the game is to show that the only way to obtain social fairness is to ignore one's own individual circumstances (race, sex, religion, income, etc.) when making deliberations that affect public life."]}

The novel is about a young girl from an upper-class family facing persecution and other challenges brought upon the upper class living in communist China. \"Revolution Is Not a Dinner Party\" begins in 1972, 6 years into the Cultural Revolution in China. Ling Chang is a nine-year-old girl whose parents are doctors which are part of the upper class society in China. When Ling's father, Dr. Chang, had free time, he would teach Ling English and they would listen to American radio shows such as Voice of America. Dr. Chang's colleague from the United States, Dr. Smith, kept close contact with Dr. Chang in the time before the Cultural Revolution via mail. A political officer, Comrade Li, moves into part of the Chang's apartment room and conducts his operations from there. With the presence of Comarade Li next door, the Changs were forced to speak about controversial topics in hushed voices and listen to the American radio underneath blankets as well as displaying a revolutionary mindset through putting up pictures of Chairman Mao Zedong and assisting Comrade Li. Shortly after the officer moved in, the father of the Chang's neighbor family is taken away and branded as an antirevolutionary. After this, Ling was fearful her father would be taken as well. Shortly thereafter, the neighbor's mother was taken away as well and their son, Niu, was forced to join the Red Guards. Meanwhile, Ling is constantly being harassed at school by children of the working class who believe Ling is bourgeois; Ling's clothing and long hair are constantly used as a means to make her look bourgeois. Ling's family were marked as bourgeois sympathizers and her father was removed from surgery and was forced to work as a janitor at the hospital. One day, Ling and her father rescue a counter-revolutionary writer who was trying to commit suicide by drowning himself. Because Ling and Dr. Chang rescued him, Niu and his gang, the Red Guard, came and arrested her father for being an antirevolutionary. Ling spends nights alone by herself during the night because her mother worked nights in the hospital and her father was no longer there. She became old enough to take over shopping for her mother and began to haggle and barter for food bought with ration tickets and by any possible means. One day at school the teacher is thrown out and Gao, one of the young revolutionaries, tries to cut her hair. Ling retaliates him with her schoolbag and gets away unscathed. She then receives news that her father will be operating on Gao’s father at the hospital. As Ling attempts to sneak into the compound, the guards catch her and throw her into a room with mats that are infected with lice. Ling sleeps on them and gets lice infested in her hair. The next morning, the gardener comes into the room and let her go. When Ling got back to her apartment, her mother had to cut all of her hair. Chairman Mao dies in 1976, but his death does not bring an end to the bleak lives of the people. Instead different revolutionary factions begin fighting with each other.

{"query": "Shinran's philosophical teachings instead of his role in Monshu lineage", "pos": ["Shinran\nShinran Shinran's birthname was Matsuwakamaro. In accordance with Japanese customs, he has also gone by other names, including Hanen, Shakku and Zenshin, and then finally to Shinran, which was derived by combining the names of Seshin (Vasubandhu in Japanese) and Donran (Tanluan’s name in Japanese). His posthumous title was Kenshin Daishi. For a while, Shinran also went by the name Fujii Yoshizane. After he was disrobed, he called himself Gutoku Shinran, in a self-deprecating manner which means \"stubble-haired foolish one,\" to denote his status as \"neither a monk, nor a layperson\". Shinran was born on May 21, 1173, to Lord and Lady Arinori, a branch of the Fujiwara clan, and was given the name Matsuwakamaro. Early in Shinran's life his parents both died. In 1181, desperate to know what happens after dying, he entered the Shoren-in temple near present-day Maruyama Park in Kyoto at age 9. He wrote this poem on entering: \"Like the cherry blossom, the heart planning on tomorrow is ephemeral indeed --what sudden storm may not arise in the middle of the night\". Actually aware of his own impermanence, he was desperate to find a solution. He then practiced at Mt. Hiei for the next 20 years of his life. Letters between his wife and daughter indicate that he was a Tendai .  According to his own account to his wife Eshinni (whose letters are preserved at the Hongan-ji), in frustration at his own failures as a monk and at obtaining enlightenment, he took a retreat at the temple of Rokkaku-dō. There, while engaged in intense practice, he experienced a vision in which Avalokitesvara appeared to him as Prince Shōtoku, directing Shinran to another disillusioned Tendai monk named Hōnen. In 1201, Shinran met Hōnen and became his disciple. During his first year under Hōnen's guidance, at the age of 29, Shinran attained enlightenment, or salvation through Amida's Vow. Though the two only knew each other for a few years, Hōnen entrusted Shinran with a copy of his secret work, the Senchakushū. However his precise status amongst Hōnen's followers is unclear as in the Seven Article Pledge, signed by Hōnen's followers in 1204, Shinran's signature appears near the middle among less-intimate disciples. During his time as a disciple of Hōnen's, Shinran caused a great stir among society by publicly getting married and eating meat. Both practices were strictly forbidden for monks, but Shinran took these drastic steps to show that Amida's salvation is for all people and not just for monks and priests. In 1207, The Buddhist establishment in Kyoto persuaded the military to impose a \"nembutsu\" ban, after an incident where two of Hōnen's most prominent followers were accused of using nembutsu practice as a coverup for sexual liaisons. These two monks were subsequently executed. Hōnen and Shinran were exiled, with Shinran being defrocked and sent to Echigo Province (contemporary Niigata Prefecture). They never met each other again. Hōnen would die later in Kyoto in 1212. Although Shinran was critical of the motivations that ultimately led to the exile, and the disruption of Hōnen's practice community, the exile itself proved to be a critical turning point in Shinran's religious life. Having been stripped of his monastic name, he renamed himself , coming to understand himself as neither monk nor layman. While in exile, Shinran sought to continue the work of Hōnen and spread the doctrine of salvation through Amida Buddha's compassion, as expressed through the \"nembutsu\" practice, however in time his teachings diverged from Hōnen enough that later followers would use the term Jōdo Shinshū or \"True [Essence of the] Pure Land Sect\", as opposed to Jōdo-shū or \"Pure Land Sect\". Shinran married his wife, Eshinni, and had seven children with her. Five years after being exiled in Echigo, in 1211, the \"nembutsu\" ban was lifted and Shinran was pardoned though he chose not to return to Kyoto at that time. Instead, Shinran left for an area known as Inada, a small area in Kantō just north of Tokyo. In 1224 Shinran authored his most significant text, Kyogyoshinsho, which is a series of selections and commentaries on Buddhist sutras supporting the new Pure Land Buddhist movement, and establishing a doctrinal lineage with Buddhist thinkers in India and China. In 1234 Shinran left the Kantō area and returned to Kyoto, with his daughter Kakushinni. On returning to Kyoto, Shinran discovered that his eldest son, Zenran (善鸞 1217 ? - 1286 ?), who remained in Hitachi and Shimotsuke provinces was telling people he received special teachings from Shinran and was otherwise leading people astray. Shinran wrote stern letters to Zenran (frequently addressed by his Buddhist name ) instructing him to cease his activities, but when Zenran refused, Shinran disowned him: Shinran died in Kyoto the year 1263 at the age of 90. Kakushinni was instrumental in maintaining the mausoleum, and passing on his teachings, with her descendants ultimately becoming the Monshu, or head of the Honganji Temples built around the Mausoleum.  Shinran considered himself a lifelong disciple of Hōnen, in spite of their separation. According to a letter composed by his wife, Eshinni: Hōnen's disciples were said to have been largely divided by questions arising from the need for a single invocation (nenbutsu) of Amitabha's name versus many-callings, and thereby emphasis on faith versus practice. Shinran, like Hōnen's disciple Kōsai, leaned more toward faith over practice, however he did not advocate the single-recitation teaching. While Shinran's teachings and beliefs were generally consistent with the Pure Land Buddhist movement at the time, he also had idiosyncrasies as well: In any case Shinran, like others in Hōnen's community, felt that in the age of Dharma Decline, it was no longer possible to achieve enlightenment through traditional monastic practices, and thus one could only rely on the vows of Amitabha Buddha, particular the 18th or \"Primal Vow\" and seek rebirth in the Pure Land. In a passage from his magnum opus, the Kyōgyōshinshō, he writes of himself: In this passage, Shinran explains that he not only gave up traditional monastic practices to focus on rebirth in the Pure Land, but that in time he eventually gave up on practices related to rebirth in the Pure Land, instead relying solely on faith in the vow of Amitabha Buddha. In the \"Kyōgyōshinshō\", third fascicle, Shinran explores the nature of , by describing it as something bestowed by Amitabha Buddha, not arising from the believer. Through this endowment, faith is awakened in a person, and the recitation of the Buddha's name or nembutsu because an expression of praise or gratitude. However, this cannot occur until the believer fully entrusts themselves to Amitabha Buddha, even for a moment. Once this state of faith is bestowed, one is assured of rebirth in the Pure Land, and ultimately enlightenment. Shinran cautions though: Further, once a follower has awakened to this deep faith, one should live life as an expression of gratitude, follow basic moral conduct and to fulfill one's social obligations. The last three fascicles of the \"Kyōgyōshinshō\" delve into the nature of Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land. The Pure Land is treated as a temporary refuge whereby one can attain enlightenment, and then return to this world to lead and teach others as a bodhisattva. Elsewhere, Shinran is quoted in the as saying: On the nature of Amitabha Buddha, Shinran stated that in their true form, both the Buddha and the Pure Land are beyond comprehension, but due to people's ignorance and attachments they can only perceive Amitabha in terms of his physical form described in the sutras, as well as the layout of the Pure Land. If one attains true faith, then upon rebirth in the Pure Land, one can perceive their true form. However, if one's faith is incomplete, or they continue to rely on their own efforts, then they will be reborn in the outer regions of the Pure Land, and will still perceive Amitabha Buddha through physical forms until eventually attaining true faith and proceeding further. Shinran's definition of Amitabha Buddha as the absolute, equating the Pure Land with Nirvana itself, therefore differed somewhat from traditional interpretations of the Pure Land in Buddhist scripture. Shinran's interpretation of the final age of the Dharma, was consistent with other Buddhist thinkers of the time. In particular, he drew inspiration from a Chinese Buddhist master named Tao-cho who centuries earlier taught that in the latter age of the Dharma the Pure Land teachings were the most suitable for the capacities of the people of the time. Shinran felt this decline was inevitable that Japan was already 600 years into age of Dharma Decline, and that people were no longer capable of maintaining Buddhist practice, let alone enlightenment. Thus, only the vow of Amitabha Buddha to save all beings could be relied upon. Shinran acknowledged the religious practices of Japan outside the Buddhist tradition, including Shinto kami, spirits, divination, astrology, etc., he believed that they were irrelevant in comparison to the power of Amitabha Buddha. He developed a Japanese Buddhist heresiology that constructed other forms of religious practice as equivalent to demon-worship; his followers would later use this equivocation both to enforce proper interpretations of Shinran's thought and to criticize \"heretical\" sects of Buddhism such as the Tachikawa-ryu. To this day, omamori, ofuda and other charms are not found in Jodo Shinshu temples. A statue of Shinran Shonin stands in Upper West Side Manhattan, in New York City. On Riverside Drive between 105th and 106th Streets, in front of the New York Buddhist Church, the statue depicts Shinran in a peasant hat and sandals, holding a wooden staff, as he peers down on the sidewalk. Although this kind of statue is often found at Jōdo Shinshū temples, the statue is notable because it survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, standing a little more than a mile from ground zero. It was brought to New York in 1955. The plaque calls the statue \"a testimonial to the atomic bomb devastation and a symbol of lasting hope for world peace.\" On March 14, 2008, what are assumed to be some of the ash remains of Shinran were found in a small wooden statue at the Jōrakuji temple in Shimogyō-ku, Kyōto. The temple was created by Zonkaku (1290–1373), the son of Kakunyo (1270–1351), one of Shinran's great grandchildren. Records indicate that Zonkaku inherited the remains of Shinran from Kakunyo. The 24.2 cm wooden statue is identified as being from the middle of the Edo period. The remains were wrapped in paper.", "The Essential Shinran\nThe Essential Shinran The Essential Shinran: A Buddhist Path of True Entrusting is a compilation of passages from the writings and life story of Shinran Shonin. Shinran, who wrote during the Kamakura Period, was a Japanese monk who founded Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, which eventually became the largest Buddhist sect in Japan. The book (compiled by Alfred Bloom, with a foreword by Ruben L.F. Habito) is divided into three major sections:  The book is an attempt to bring Pure Land Buddhism to the attention of a Western audience.  The book received the Silver (2nd) \"Book of the Year Award\" in the Religion category (2007) from ForeWord Magazine.", "Kyogyoshinsho\nKyogyoshinsho , often abbreviated to , is the magnum opus of Shinran Shonin, the founder of the Japanese Buddhist sect, Jodo Shinshu. The title is often translated as \"The True Teaching, Practice, and Realization of the Pure Land Way\" in English. The work was written after Shinran's exile, and is believed to have been composed in the year 1224. It represents a synthesis of various Buddhist sutras in Mahayana literature, including the \"Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life\", the \"Nirvana Sutra\", the \"Avatamsaka Sutra\" and the \"Mahaprajñaparamita Sutra\". In this way, Shinran expounds Jodo Shinshu thought. The work is divided into six chapters, not including the Preface:  In addition to frequent quotations from Buddhist sutras, Shinran often quotes the Jodo Shinshu dharma masters, who comprise the teaching lineage, which extends from Shakyamuni Buddha to Shinran's teacher Honen. At the beginning of each chapter Shinran begins with the phrase (in English) \"Compiled by Gutoku Shinran, Disciple of Shakyamuni\". The name \"Gutoku\" or \"foolish, stubble-headed one\" was the name Shinran gave himself after he was exiled from Kyoto. This is the shortest of the six chapters, and mostly quotes from the Larger Sutra of Immeasurable Life to explain that encountering a Buddha is extremely rare and auspicious for all beings, and that Shakyamuni Buddha's appearance in the world was expressly to propound the Pure Land teachings. This chapter delves in more detail the basis for Pure Land Buddhist thought namely:  Later the chapter quotes at length passages from the writings of Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Shan-tao and Hōnen as well as other Jodo Shinshu Patriarchs in chronological order. Shinran appears to be providing a progression of ideas among Buddhist writers that shows the evolution of Pure Land Buddhism. Among the topics discussed and cited are the recitation of the Amitabha's name, or nembutsu, the Path of the Bodhisattva, and the nature of the Pure Land itself. Toward the end, Shinran turns toward the topic of tariki or \"Other Power\" and again quotes from various sutras and commentaries to draw his ideas upon. At the end of Chapter 2, Shinran writes his famous hymn, the Shoshinge or \"Hymn of true Entrusting\", which is a cornerstone of Jodo Shinshu liturgy. The preface to this chapter begins with Shinran discussing his belief in shinjin, or total entrusting to Amitabha Buddha, and how other schools focused on self-power are floundering in their efforts. In Chapter 3 itself, Shinran discusses shinjin in much detail, and why it is central to Jodo Shinshu practice. For Shinran, the total entrusting to Amitabha represented the most assured way for the common man to be reborn into the Pure Land, because rebirth would occur entirely through the compassion and wisdom of Amitabha. Again, Shinran quotes at length from both Tan-luan and Shan-tao who expounded the subject in detail in explaining the ideas of reciting Amitabha's and entrusting one's self to the practice of it. Shinran then discuss the nature of shinjin, and describes it as the \"mind aspiring for great enlightenment\" in a transcendent, crosswise manner, as opposed to the direct manner found in self-oriented practices. Here Shinran reiterates the point that if one abandons \"sundry practices\" and entrusts themselves to Amitabha for one thought-moment, they will attain a state of shinjin and their birth in the Pure Land will be assured. Shinran then lists the benefits of practicing the nembutsu, or recitation of Amitabha's name. These include a great sense of joy, the praise of the myriad Buddhas, the protection of the myriad Buddhas, and a state of being \"truly settled\". The last section of Chapter 3 focuses on what defines people who cannot be saved by other Buddhist practices, who are seen as the main focus of Amitabha's Primal Vow. In the comparatively short Chapter 4, Shinran begins by writings about nature of Amitabha as the Dharmakaya itself, and that those who attain shinjin are assured of Nirvana. Noteworthy is the quote at the beginning of the chapter: After the introduction, Shinran writes about the idea, first posited by Hōnen, about Amitabha's intent to lead all beings to the Pure Land through smarana, so that they can become Bodhisattvas. These Bodhisattvas, will then return to the world to lead other beings along the Buddhist path. Again, Shinran expands on these ideas by citing the writings of past patriarchs of Pure Land thought. Chapter 5 is devoted to the Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha, and birth there. Shinran writes that the Pure Land represents truth and reality, and upon birth in the Pure Land, one's delusions are immediately gone. As the Buddha Amitabha embodies the truth (symbolized by infinite light) his Pure Land and birth there represents awakening from delusions and defilements. This complements Chapter 4's assertion that shinjin is the same as Nirvana. Chapter 6 is the longest chapter of the Kyogyoshinsho, and brings other Buddhist sects and practices into the context of Pure Land Buddhism as varying forms of skillful means. Other Buddhist writers in medieval Japan similarly tried to categorize Buddhist sects into a form of hierarchy, and here Shinran attempts to do the same. Shinran believes that in the era of Mappo, most of the original practices and teachings have died out or lost their efficacy, and so the only viable path left is the Pure Land path. The end of Chapter 6, the Postscript, includes a brief autobiography, particularly during and after Shinra's exile from Kyoto in the year 1207. He writes about how he came to Hōnen's teachings in the year 1201 and feels he has remained his disciple ever since. He explains that his motivation is to share his joy in finding the Pure Land and hopes that others will take refuge in Amitabha as well. Shinran concludes the Kyogyoshinsho with a passage from the \"Flower Garland Sutra\":", "Shinjin\nShinjin In Shin Buddhism, Shinjin (信心) was originally the Japanese word for the Buddhist concept of citta-prasāda (clear or clarified heart-mind), but now carries a more popular related meaning of faith or entrusting. According to Ueda, \"shinjin is the mind of Amida Buddha given to and realized in a person. Shinran interprets shin (信) to mean truth, reality, sincerity; jin (心) means mind. When shinjin is realized, Amida's mind (wisdom and compassion) and the practitioners mind of blind passions become one.\" Whilst a general Japanese Buddhist term it is particularly associated with the Jodo Shinshu teaching of Shinran. In that context it refers to the awakening and settlement of the mind that is aware of the working of Amida Buddha's Primal Vow, and the assurance of birth in the Pure Land at death:  In \"Notes on 'Essentials of Faith Alone\"' Shinran writes \"Know that the true essence of the Pure Land teaching is that when we realize true and real shinjin, we are born in the true fulfilled land.\""], "neg": ["Shinshin-tōitsu-dō\nShinshin-tōitsu-dō Nakamura Tempu created his Japanese Yoga from a variation of Raja Yoga and Karma Yoga, with an emphasis on the latter, which he learned from his Indian teacher Kaliapa (also spelled Cariapa and Kariappa), who took him to Gorkhe, in eastern Nepal.

{"query": "International Men's and Mixed Netball Association current initiatives instead of formation history", "pos": ["Netball and the Olympic Movement\nNetball and the Olympic Movement Netball is an Olympic recognised sport, a status attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying. It has never been played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community had not been able to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state and federal governments. According to Dyer in 1982, exclusion of netball from the Summer Olympics is part of the historical pattern of the slow growth and gradual acceptance of women's sports. Women first competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics in only three sports: tennis, croquet and golf. Women's cycling was excluded for many years despite having world championships organised by 1958. Field hockey, a sport included for men as early as 1908, was not open to competition by women until 1980. By the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, there were 159 medal events for men, but only 86 for women, and 12 for both men and women, and as late as 1996, 26 countries sent no women to the Olympics. There were still sports that excluded women at the 2000 Summer Olympics, such as boxing, wrestling and baseball. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, every country but Nauru did, and both men and women competed in 34 sports. At the 2012 Olympics, there were two sports for women only: synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics. That netball is also played mostly by women is seen as a drawback. Netball does allow for mixed teams, but the Olympics did not include mixed sex team sports. Rugby sevens and golf, primarily played by men, were chosen for inclusion in the 2016 Summer Olympics for both sexes ahead of netball. The issue of male over-representation in terms of total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive financial support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming that there are more opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females. Efforts to gain Olympic recognition started in 1967, at the time when the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA) was founded. The Jamaican and Singaporean delegations present at the meeting suggested the newly created organisation become affiliated with the World Olympic Sports Council and try to get netball included on the Olympic programme. Opinions were initially split inside the newly formed organisation as to whether this was a goal worth striving for, but ultimately it was decided to work towards Olympic recognition. The federation's first application was rejected because it referred to the sport as women's basketball and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said there could not be two different sports with the same name on the Olympic programme. This rejection was a driving factor for changing the name of the sport. There was tremendous resistance in Australia and New Zealand to this. IFNA made \"major concessions\" to both countries to persuade them to change the name of their national federations. In 1965, the IOC criteria required a sport must be played in at least 11 nations and the international body represented the sport must have at least 27 national organisations affiliated with it. A second application was started in 1971 after the previous rejection which reflected the name change. While name changes and other International Olympic Committee suggestions were agreed upon as necessary to go forward, the integration of these changes into the Federation's constitution and governance strategy took over four years and the application languished as a result until 1979, when the IOC responded with a request for additional information on IFNA's finances and governance. The decision to provide additional information was deferred until 1979's Conference. The Jamaican representatives were frustrated with the slow process inside the organisation and tried to take steps to speed the process up inside IFNA. This included submitting proposals for organisational changes to address the most recent IOC feedback, addressing issues such as player drug testing, the selling of television and radio rights, and how to establish an Olympic draw among other points. Because of Jamaican influence, IFNA created a specific committee to work on the issue of addressing Olympic requirements, which was composed of New Zealanders Rena Straford, Lorna McOnchie and Anne Taylor. They were supposed to have these issues addressed by a meeting scheduled at the end of 1979. Delays happened because of the structure of IFNA and the required material was not ready for presenting before IFNA's Council until 1983. During this four-year waiting period, Jamaica and Bermuda continued to agitate for the Federation to speed the process along as attaining recognition would provide their region with additional funding and make it easier to grow the sport regionally. The second application was eventually rejected in 1983, with the IOC claiming the sport had \"limited popularity\". While netball was not able to gain Olympic recognition during this period, it did gain recognition from General Assembly of International Sports Federations. This allowed netball to be played at the World Games in 1985. Because of the 1983 rejection, an earlier idea that had been tried and failed in 1979 was revisited: Creating regional Federations for the Americas, Europe, Oceania and Asia, regional groupings mirroring that of the Olympic organisers. This was implemented by 1987, which was rejected later that year because the sport did not meet all the criteria established and it was not yet a global sport. The IOC viewed the sport as one belonging only to the Commonwealth of Nations. While the netball was rejected for a third time, the New Zealand hosts of the 1990 Commonwealth Games managed to get the sport to have demonstration status, with the news of this being announced in 1987. That same year, netball also gained full member status from the General Assembly of International Sports Federations In the mean time, the IOC did provide the Federation with a grant, though none of this grant money was used by 1991. Because of what appeared to be the unlikely recognition by the IOC, the Federation urged its national members to seek membership with their national Olympic committees so national federations could access national funding in order to help grow the sport inside their home countries. A decision was made to try again for Olympic recognition was made, but the Federation was irritated because they had never been given clear guidelines for what the IOC was looking for in terms of a sport gaining Olympic recognition. The Federation believed that every time they met the criteria they were given, there was a new hoop for them to jump through. An example of this was a requirement given to the Federation 1992/1993 that the IOC be given technical specs for venue space should the sport be included on the Olympic programme. The Federation continued to work to address these requirements and eventually, in October 1993, netball through IFNA was given provisional Olympic recognition, requiring a two-year probation period. This recognition came with a per year per region for the Federation to develop the sport around the world. In 1995, netball became a permanent Olympic recognised sport after a twenty-year period of lobbying and a two-year probation period. This makes it eligible to be played in future Games. Recognition has meant national associations could become full members of their countries' national Olympic committees. National members of IFNA were able to apply for that recognition by 1993. The All Australia Netball Association is one national organisation that has become a full member of their national Olympic committee. In 2004, International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognition of the IFNA was renewed. The IFNA has made Olympic recognition part of its long-term strategy towards continuing to grow the game. There have been multiple attempts by netball supporters to get the sport played in the Summer Olympics. In 1996, the netball leadership actively pursued the possibility of netball being played at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The government of New South Wales encouraged the Australian Olympic Committee to lobby for the inclusion of netball in the 2008 Beijing Olympic games. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Netball England national team member Tamsin Greenway, two time Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes and Olympic heptathlon competitor Denise Lewis are English supporters who would like to see netball in future Olympic games. The earliest the sport could be included on the programme would be 2024. In an extraordinary session in Mexico City in November 2002, the IOC decided to limit the total number of sports to 28, events to 301 and athletes to 10,500, slowing the process of adding new sports to future Olympic Games. At the extraordinary session, the IOC set forth the requirements that a sport must meet before it is eligible for inclusion in the Olympic programme. The table created in the documentation for this meeting is provided below: The lack of Olympic recognition hampered the globalisation of the game in developing countries because the Olympic Solidarity Movement provides access to funding for these nations through the International Olympic Committee. In some countries, such as Tanzania, the lack of access to Olympic funding cut off other options such as funding by the British Council. With official recognition, funding from the IOC, the Olympic Solidarity Movement and the British Council became available to cover costs for travel to international competitions. For some nations, without that assistance, trying to maintain international calibre teams was difficult. Olympic recognition brought money for development into the sport. In 2004, IFNA received a grant of from the IOC for development. IFNA was given an additional a year until 2007 by the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports (ARISF). Beyond access to funds from the IOC, state and national sporting bodies, and state and federal governments often use IOC status as a funding criteria. This has been the case in Australia, and British Columbia, Canada. In 1985, the Australian Sports Commission and the Office of the Status of Women identified five criteria for obtaining federal funding. One of these was \"status as an Olympic sport and its size by registrations.\" In British Columbia, one of the guidelines says that in order to receive funding, \"the sport must be on the program for either the 2011 or 2013 Canada Games and/or the next scheduled recognized International Multi-Sport Games (Olympics/Paralympics, Pan American or Commonwealth Games, Special Olympic World Games)\". The IOC and its daughter organisations give awards and scholarships. In 1995, two of the scholarships offered by the Oceania Olympic Training Centre were given to netballers: Janaet Snape and Darlene Marsters. The Oceania Olympic Training Centre also made it possible for Mona-Lisa Leka from Papua New Guinea to go to Australia to train. In 2007, the IOC awarded Veitu Apana Diro, the Vice-President of the NOC of Papua New, the Trophy for Oceania. This recognition came in part because she had created the nation's national netball organisation in 1965 and actively promoted women's involvement in netball around the country. Netball is most popular in Commonwealth countries, and the most popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania and the effort to increase media attention and participation for women's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates of interest and few facilities. Even then, historically, coverage of women's team sports in the Olympics has been limited. Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders. National netball associations have been involved with national Olympic committees as members or associate members, or had their administrators generally involved with national Olympic Committees, for a long time. In the case of the Bahamas, by 1960 the Bahamas Olympic Association had as one of its member organisations the national netball association. Netball was also represented in the Dominica Olympic Committee almost from the moment the organisation was founded. Some of the national netball federations that are affiliated with their national Olympic Committee include Netball Singapore and the All Australia Netball Association."], "neg": ["Fast5 Netball World Series\nFast5 Netball World Series The Fast5 Netball World Series is an international netball competition that was contested for the first time in October 2009. The new competition features modified \"Fast5\" rules, and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens. The competition is contested by the six top national netball teams in the world, according to the INF World Rankings. Before 2008, the major competitions in international netball were the Netball World Championships and the netball event of the Commonwealth Games, both held every four years. First-tier national teams also participated in yearly test series, with others playing in regional events. However, several significant changes in international netball occurred in 2008. Changes to international test rules were finalised at an International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA) congress in Auckland in 2007, and progressively rolled out across netball-playing countries the following year. The IFNA also introduced a new world rankings system to compare the performances of national teams. In England, a campaign was started advocating netball's inclusion in the Olympic Games, as a demonstration sport in 2012 and potentially as a competitive sport from 2016. In the Southern Hemisphere, the sport attained semi-professional status in Australia and New Zealand with the introduction of the ANZ Championship. Also, in December 2008 a new international netball competition was announced, the World Netball Series, to be contested in 2009 under modified rules. The new rules had been trialled by England junior and senior squads over a 12-month period. DVDs were sent to coaches of the participating teams for consultation. Some of the new rules were announced in December 2008, including six-minute playing quarters and power plays; others were announced in February 2009. Prior to the 2012 edition the rules were revamped and renamed Fast5. The competition is held over three days, and is played under Fast5 rules. Each team plays each other once during the first two days in a round-robin format. The four highest-scoring teams from this stage progress to the finals, played on the final day of competition, in which the 1st-ranked team plays the 4th-ranked team, while 2nd plays 3rd. The winners of these two matches contest the Grand Final; the remaining teams contest the third- and fifth-place playoffs. The first three editions of the tournament were held in England. Initially, Manchester was to host all three seasons in England at the MEN Arena. The venue is the largest indoor arena in Europe, capable of seating around 20,000 spectators. However, the 2010 tournament was held in Liverpool at the Echo Arena,as will the 2011 tournament. The World Netball Series is organised by the International Netball Federation (INF), in conjunction with the national governing bodies of the six competing nations each year, UK Sport and the host city's local council. England Netball covers air travel, accommodation, food and local travel expenses for all teams during the competition, while the respective netball governing bodies cover player allowances. Australian coach Norma Plummer greeted the new tournament positively: \"If you want your sport to keep growing these days, it's got to become up with the times and keep having innovations that make the game exciting for not only the players, but all the spectators.\" But Plummer also expressed some reservations about power plays being used against substantially weaker teams, and also about penalty shootouts and the new centre pass rule. Netball New Zealand (NNZ) Chief Executive Raelene Castle stated that she was \"excited about what the new competition could bring to the ever-increasing profile of Netball internationally\". However, Castle also acknowledged that the shortened version of the game \"may not be for everyone\".

But in the middle of the 2017-18 season, the IRT changed its match scoring from best of 5 games to 11 points to a best of 3 games with the first 2 games to 15 points and the tie-breaker to 11. Moreover, each of the three games was win by 1 point rather than 2 points, as it was under the previous rule with games to 11 points. The rule came into effect at the start of the 2018 calendar year. Beginning in the 2010-2011 season, the IRT has changed its service rule so that players get two opportunities to put the ball into play (two serve rule), as in tennis where players are allowed two faults before losing a point. Since the 1990s, the IRT had been using a one serve rule, so a fault serve resulted in an immediate loss of serve. Note: The US Open Racquetball Championships began in November 1996."]}

It is an active-duty associate unit administratively assigned to the 495th Fighter Group and operates aircraft assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command's 301st Fighter Wing. Prior to its reactivation in 2015, the unit's last assignment was that of a subordinate unit of the 354th Fighter Wing based at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, flying the Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on 15 August 2007 as a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005. Activated on 15 November 1942 at Hamilton Field, California, initially equipped with P-39 Airacobras and assigned to IV Fighter Command for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to Portland Army Air Base, Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new North American P-51B Mustangs. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the European Theater of Operations, being assigned to IX Fighter Command in England. In late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany being conducted by VIII Bomber Command was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the VIII Fighter Command's Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts lacked the range to escort the heavy B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers deep into Germany to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, Eighth Air Force to perform escort missions. From its base at RAF Boxted, the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging Luftwaffe day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German Bf 109 and Fw 190 interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty. Was relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to RAF Lashenden on the southern coast of England. Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over Normandy and along the English Channel coast of France and the Low Countries, April–June 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of D-Day. Moved to Advanced Landing Grounds in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France. Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields. Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge, then moved eastward as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at Ansbach (R-45). Remained in Occupied Germany as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe XII Tactical Air Command occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at AAF Station Herzogenaurach. Was inactivated on 31 March 1946. Reactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated 354th Fighter-Day Group at the new Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina. Equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the Tactical Air Command within the US and abroad. The unit frequently deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy and Wheelus Air Base, Libya. Was deployed to Europe during the 1958 Lebanon crisis and was moved to McCoy Air Force Base, Florida in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to support the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Phù Cát Air Base, South Vietnam for five months' Temporary Duty (TDY). At the end of the TDY on 5 July, the 355 TFS was permanently assigned to the 37th, with activated New Jersey and District of Columbia Air National Guard personnel from the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach replacing them and manning the unit. On 15 May 1969 with the reassignment of the 612th and 174th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, it was decided to convert the 37th to a McDonnell F-4 Phantom II wing. The F-100 equipped 355th, along with the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron were reassigned to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air Base, replacing the Air National Guard 136th and 188th Tactical Fighter Squadrons which were returning to New York and New Mexico, respectively. At Tuy Hoa, the tail code of the 355th F-100s was changed to \"SP\", and deployed Air National Guard personnel from New York and New Mexico and regular Air Force personnel manned the 355th until its inactivation on 30 September 1970. During its time in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close air support, interdiction, search and rescue, and helicopter support missions. The squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm for its service. On 1 November 1970, the 355 TFS was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina as part of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing. Upon its return, the unit transitioned to the new LTV A-7D Corsair II aircraft before redeploying to Southeast Asia in the fall of 1972 as the first A-7 unit to fight there. In 10 weeks of combat before the end of that conflict, the squadron participated in the Linebacker II campaign, generated more than 4,000 sorties, and was credited with 22 rescues of downed airmen. The unit returned to Myrtle Beach in April 1974. In February 1978, the 355 FS transitioned to the new Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, a close air support aircraft, becoming the second operational squadron in the nation's first A-10 wing. Duty called again in August 1990 when the unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There, the squadron's pilots inflicted heavy damage to Iraqi armor and artillery emplacements, helped cut off enemy supply lines, and conducted search and rescue missions. The squadron contributed greatly to the 4,200 artillery, tank and other vehicle kills credited to A-10s during the war. Inactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was reactivated on 20 August 1993, replacing the inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska. The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close air support, interdiction, joint air attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue. With a dual role A/OA-10 Warthog squadron commitment and night vision goggles, the squadron had the ability to deploy forward air controllers with attack aircraft for a complete day and night employment capability. 355 FS deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy from January 1996 to March 1997, supporting Operation Joint Guard. No ordnance was employed, but pilots flew sorties and sat alert with combat loaded aircraft. The 355th FS also provided air liaison officers for the 172d Stryker Brigade Combat, providing advice, as ground forward air controllers, on the use of fighters and the tactical employment of close air support assets. In October 1998, the 355 FS deployed to support Operation Southern Watch. Only two months later, the Warthogs saw their second tour of combat duty over Iraq while participating in the 16–19 December 1998, Operation Desert Fox strike missions. In 2.5 months, the 355 FS flew 597 combat and combat support sorties leading up to, then conducting, National Command Authority directed strikes on Iraqi military facilities and suspected weapons of mass destruction storage areas. They achieved 100 percent target hit rate. The unit deployed to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, in support of Operation Southern Watch, January–March 2001. The 355 FS also exercised at Hurlburt Field, Florida, to train with Special Forces units, October 2003. In Spring 2004 the unit deployed to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit redeployed there again early 2006. During both deployments the unit was responsible to provide close air support to Army ground forces and convoys in Afghanistan. On 13 May 2005, The Department of Defense proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the Base Realignment and Closure program. The A-10 aircraft were to be distributed to the 917th Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana (three aircraft); to a new active-duty unit at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory (three aircraft). Lt Col Quentin “Q-Tip” Rideout, 355th Fighter Squadron Commander, flew the last operational A-10 sortie at Eielson AFB on 31 July 2007. The last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson AFB on 15 August 2007. Lt Col Kevin \"Crotch\" Blanchard flew 81-944, Capt Sean \"Shark\" Hall flew 79-172, and Capt Dale \"Porkchop\" Stark flew 80-259. Although the aircraft were originally scheduled to depart at 0700, they were delayed until 0830 because of foggy conditions. Lt Col Blanchard was the first to lift off, followed closely by Capt Hall. When Capt Stark took off, and shortly before disappearing into the clouds, he tipped the wings of his jet, a final farewell salute to Eielson AFB and the 355th Fighter Squadron. In 2010, Detachment 457, a geographically separated unit of the 20th Operations Group at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, stood up at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas. The unit oversaw the integration of over 130 active-duty General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon pilots and maintenance personnel into the Air Force Reserve Command's 301st Fighter Wing under the Total Force Initiative. On March 8, 2013, the 495th Fighter Group was stood up at Shaw as a dedicated unit overseeing ten active associate fighter units, including Detachment 457. On October 5, 2015, Detachment 457 discontinued and was replaced by the 355th Fighter Squadron, which reactivated the same day. It remains under administrative command of the 495th Fighter Group and flies and maintains F-16s assigned to the 301st's 457th Fighter Squadron at Fort Worth.", "355th Fighter Wing\n355th Fighter Wing The 355th Fighter Wing (355 FW) is a United States Air Force unit assigned to the Air Combat Command's Twelfth Air Force. It is stationed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, where it operates the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The wing's mission is to provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction (AI), forward air control (FAC), combat search and rescue (CSAR), ground-based tactical air control, and airbase operations. 355th Operations Group (355 OG) 355th Maintenance Group (355 MXG) 355th Mission Support Group (355 MSG) 355th Medical Group (355 MDG) The 355th Fighter Group was first activated 12 November 1942. Originally equipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, the group began using North American P-51 Mustangs in Spring, 1944. The group was under the command of the 65th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command, Eighth Air Force. The aircraft group identification was white spinners and cowling bands. The group consisted of the following squadrons:  The 355th FG flew its first combat mission, a fighter sweep over Belgium, on 14 September 1943 and afterwards served primarily as escort for B-17/B-24 bombers that attacked industrial areas of Berlin, marshalling yards at Karlsruhe, an airfield at Neuberg, oil refineries at Misburg, synthetic oil plants at Gelsenkirchen, locks at Minden, and other objectives. The group also flew fighter sweeps, area patrols, and bombing missions, striking such targets as air parks, locomotives, bridges, radio stations, and armoured cars. The 355th quickly gained acclaim as the \"Steeple Morden Strafers,\" a reference to its base in England and its lethal accuracy at low level. The fighter group destroyed or damaged 1,500 enemy planes, making it the top strafing outfit in the VIII Fighter Command during World War II. On 5 April 1944, shortly after converting from Thunderbolts to Mustangs, the group successfully bombed and strafed German airfields during a snow squall, a mission for which the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. The group provided fighter cover for Allied forces landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944, and afterwards hit transportation facilities to cut enemy supply lines. Hit fuel dumps, locomotives, and other targets in support of ground forces during the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July. The 355th Fighter Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945. On 3 July the group transferred to Gablingen, Germany for duty with United States Air Forces in Europe as part of the army of occupation. Transferred, without personnel and equipment, to Mitchel Field New York on 1 August 1946. It was inactivated on 20 November due to the Air Force's policy of retaining only low-numbered groups on active duty after the war, and its mission, personnel and equipment transferred to the 14th Fighter Group which was simultaneously activated. Aces of the 355th Ftr Gp In August 1955, the group was redesignated the 355th Fighter Group (Air Defense) and reactivated as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars. The group replaced the 516th Air Defense Group and assumed its mission, personnel and equipment at McGhee Tyson Airport, near Knoxville Tennessee. The 516th's 469th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was reassigned to the group, while the 354th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron moved on paper from Oxnard Air Force Base, California to take over the aircraft of the 460th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved without personnel or equipment to Portland International Airport, Oregon. The group served as the United States Air Force host organization for active duty units at McGhee Tyson and was assigned a number of maintenance and support units to carry out this function. The 354th and 469th Squadrons both flew the radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86D Sabre. The group focused on defending the Oak Ridge atomic plant and Alcoa aluminum production site. In July 1957 the 355th was reduced to a single fighter squadron when the 469th was inactivated. Regular Air Force operations at McGhee Tyson ended on 8 January 1958 when the 355th Group and the 354th Squadron inactivated, and the base was turned over to the Tennessee Air National Guard, which had organized the 134th Fighter Group there the previous month. On 13 April 1962 the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing was established and activated at George AFB, California, being equipped with the new F-105 Thunderchief. After a period of organization at George, the wing was assigned to McConnell AFB, Kansas, becoming the host unit at the base. The unit transferred to the Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand in 1965. During the next five years, it flew more than 101,000 sorties over North Vietnam, dropping 202,596 tons of bombs and destroying 12,675 targets. The wing's pilots were credited with twenty airborne kills of MiG aircraft and eight aircraft destroyed on the ground. Nicknamed \"PACAF's Pride,\" the unit received three Presidential Unit Citations and three Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with the combat \"V\" device. It is also noteworthy that, of the twelve airmen awarded the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War, two belonged to the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing: Majors Merlyn H. Dethlefsen and Leo K. Thorsness. The 355th was inactivated at Takhli on 10 December 1970 as part of the drawdown of US Forces in Southeast Asia in the early 1970s. The 355th was reactivated at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 1971, being assigned to Tactical Air Command. Initially, the wing had four squadrons (333d, 354th, 357th and 358th) equipped with the new A-7D Corsair II ground air support aircraft. It achieved operationally-ready status in 1972. In late 1972, the 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed its Corsairs to Korat Royal Thai Air Fore Base, Thailand and was attached to the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward Echelon), which had deployed to Korat from Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina. From Korat, the 354th, and later the 357th, which replaced the 354th TFS in June 1973, conducted combat operations first in South Vietnam, then in 1973, in Cambodia, supporting the Lon Nol Government until 15 August 1973 when US combat operations in Southeast Asia were halted by Congress. Withdrawing from Thailand in 1974, the wing began to send its Corsairs to the Air National Guard, and transitioning to the new A-10 Thunderbolt II. By 1979, the wing had completely transitioned to the A-10 and achieved operationally ready status. On 1 September 1979, Tactical Air Command took the 355th off deployment status and redesignated it as the 355th Tactical Training Wing becoming the USAF's A-10 Thunderbolt II Operational Training Unit. In 1984 the 355th Fighter Group was consolidated with the Wing, giving the 355th Tactical Training Wing the history, honors and lineage of the World War II and Cold War organization. As the wing entered the 1990s, it continued to train A-10 crews for assignments to units in the United States, England, and South Korea. The 355th Wing regularly participated in air support exercises such as Air Warrior and weapons competitions such as Long Rifle, in which it consistently captured top A-10 honors. However, the wing's excellence wasn't limited to the cockpit; in 1990, it received the TAC Commander's Award for top aircraft maintenance, in the A-10 category, for the third consecutive year. The wing's training program paid off when in 1990 squadrons were deployed to King Fhad International Airport in Saudi Arabia, being assigned to the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional) during operation Desert Shield. In 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, when 355th-trained A-10 pilots destroyed 1,000 tanks, 2,000 vehicles, 1,200 artillery pieces, and two helicopters. While the wing as a whole did not deploy to the Persian Gulf, more than 250 members augmented forces in theater and filled shortages in the United States. On 1 October 1991, the 355th Tactical Training Wing was redesignated as the 355th Fighter Wing under the \"Objective Wing\" concept adapted by the Air Force as the lines between tactical and strategic forces blurred and the Air Force leadership began to merge these forces under Air Combat Command. The flying components of the wing were reassigned to the newly established 355th Operations Group. As part of this restructuring, on 1 May 1992, the 355th became a composite wing, absorbing elements of the 602nd Air Control Wing, the 41st Electronic Combat Squadron, and of most other activities currently operating at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. With these diverse units as part of the organization, the designation was changed to the 355th Wing on 1 May 1992. An era came to a close when on 30 September 2002 the 42d Airborne Command and Control Squadron was designated inactive. The 355th Wing then underwent an extensive reorganization of forces on 1 October 2002. During this reorganization, new squadrons were added to the existing wing structure, while some squadrons were realigned under new group commanders. The 355th Wing also inherited the 48th, 55th, and 79th Rescue Squadrons equipped with HC-130 aircraft and HH-60 helicopters. Another change saw the 41st and 43d Electronic Combat Squadrons fall under the operational control of the 55th Electronic Combat Group, 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. On 1 October 2003, the three combat search-and-rescue squadrons fell under the command of the 563d Rescue Group.

In a short space of time the gun caught fire so Pinney, exposed to enemy fire, got up to put out the fire. Firing around fifty rounds Ward Gunn destroyed two German tanks while the portee was burning. When Ward Gunn was killed, Pinney pushed his body out of the way to continue the action single-handedly until it was eventually put out of action by direct enemy fire. Pinney was killed by a stray shell the following day. Despite the inadequacy of the 2-pounder portee guns that only had effect at short range, the battle halted a divisional advance. Both Pinney and Ward Gunn were put forward for the Victoria Cross; which Ward Gunn was posthumously awarded. Portee cavalry is horse cavalry – both the horses and their riders – carried in trucks or other carriers. The cavalry is thus mechanized for strategic and operational movement, and horse-mounted for tactical deployment. Portee cavalry units were briefly tested in the American army during the interwar change from fully horsed cavalry to fully mechanized cavalry, but were generally found to be overcomplicated and not worthwhile."], "neg": ["QF 2.95-inch Mountain Gun\nQF 2.95-inch Mountain Gun The QF 2.95 inch mountain gun was the designation given by the British to a Vickers 75mm calibre gun. It was originally produced for the Egyptian Army. It was taken into British service in the late 19th Century to provide the 'movable armament' at some coaling stations. Also known as 'The Millimetre Gun', it was used by the West African Frontier Force in several theatres in Africa during World War I. It was also used by United States and Philippines. The weapon could be broken down and carried by 4 horses or mules, or in British use in Africa by men. The weapon was not adopted by the British Army or the Indian Army, which used the BL 10 pounder Mountain Gun and later the BL 2.75 inch Mountain Gun, but it was used from 1901 by the defence forces of some British African colonies as part of the Royal West African Frontier Force (WAFF). The officers and most NCOs were British, and the gunners, gun carriers and some NCOs were African. As part of the British Empire these units became part of the British war effort in World War I. Thirty guns were originally supplied to West Africa (Sierra Leone, Gold Coast and Nigeria). Guns involved in the West Africa campaign were used by the Sierra Leone Company Royal Garrison Artillery (6 guns), Gold Coast Battery WAFF (6 guns), 1st and 2nd Nigerian Battery WAFF (6 guns each). Guns of the Gold Coast Battery fired the first British Empire artillery rounds of World War I, in the attack on Khra in Togoland on 22 August 1914. The gun was also used in the East Africa campaign, originally a section of the Gold Coast Battery, and from December 1916 the 1st Nigerian Battery. In one action, Corporal Awudo Kano and five Nigerian gunners stayed by their gun during the British attack near Melong in Kamerun, 4 March 1915. Their officer was wounded and the infantry forced to retire, but though isolated they refused to abandon the officer or their guns, and continued firing until relieved. The US purchased 12 guns in 1899 and used them in the Philippine-American War (otherwise known as the Philippine Insurrection). By 30 June 1904 another 120 guns were purchased. Carriages and pack saddles were manufactured at Watertown and Rock Island. It was also used in World War II by US and Philippine forces defending against the Japanese invasion. Approximately 50 were issued to the Filipino Army artillery regiments. The US Army Philippine Division had one battalion of the 23rd Artillery (Philippine Scouts) equipped with the 2.95 in mountain gun. The British \"Treatise on Ammunition\" of 1915 stated that available rounds were Shrapnel (203 bullets), Case shot (330 bullets), Star shell and the Double common shell of 18 lb (exploding charge of 14 oz \"P\" mixture - gunpowder). According to the US manual of 1916 the \"Double explosive\" shell was no longer in US use.", "Demi-cannon\nDemi-cannon The demi-cannon was a medium-sized cannon, similar to but slightly larger than a culverin and smaller than a regular 42 lb (19 kg) cannon, developed in the early seventeenth century. A full cannon fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued in the eighteenth century as they were seen as too unwieldy. The lower tiers of seventeenth century English warships were usually equipped with demi-cannons. Ships featuring demi-cannons included HMS \"Sovereign of the Seas\", HMS \"Resolution\" and HMS \"James\", which fought in the Anglo-Dutch naval wars. The barrels of demi-cannon were typically 11 ft (3.4m) long, had a calibre of 6 inches (15.4 cm) and could weigh up to 5600 lb (2540 kg). It required 18 lb (8 kg) of black powder to fire a 32 lb (14.5 kg) round shot. The demi-cannon had an effective range of 1600 ft (490m). These 32-pounders were used during the eighteenth century on first-rate three-decker ships of the line which carried up to 100 guns. Though powerful, the naval demi-cannons were inaccurate except at close range so opposing warships would try to get as close as possible before firing their broadside in order to cause as much damage as possible; sometimes a single broadside was enough to cripple the enemy vessel."]}

The series aired from 1986 to 1989 on the Radio-Canada network, and revival series on TQS in 2001 and on TVA from 2004 to the present. The first season was filmed in both French and English, the English version appearing on CBC Television as \"He Shoots, He Scores\". It was the first television series to air simultaneously in English on CBC and in French on Radio-Canada. (An earlier series, \"La famille Plouffe\", had aired on both networks, but not simultaneously; the English version aired approximately a year behind the French series. Each episode of \"Lance et Compte\", however, aired in English as \"He Shoots, He Scores\" in the same \"week\".) The series was scripted by Réjean Tremblay and Louis Caron for the first season, and by Tremblay and Jacques Jacob after that. Following the end of the regular series, a number of television movies continued to air into the 1990s. A new generation of the series started to air in 2001 and a movie was made in 2010. The series was written by Réjean Tremblay and novelist Louis Caron for the first season (later replaced by Jacques Jacob), and tells the story of the fictional National Hockey League team Le National from Quebec City, and its players. The main protagonist is Pierre Lambert (Carl Marotte), the young, handsome player drafted by Le National from the Trois-Rivières Dragons junior team. In the first series, Pierre Lambert is selected to play for Le National de Québec, his boyhood team, along with his best friend Denis Mercure (Jean Harvey). During that year, Pierre learns how to control himself in the pro level and how to deal with hockey and his love life. The second series is focused on the World Cup of Hockey. Pierre Lambert is selected to play for Team Canada but personal issues make him play at a very bad level. Pierre has to deal with those issues in time to help Canada win the World Cup. The theme of Soviet hockey players wanting to flee their country and play in North America is also included in the series. In the third installment of the series, Le National de Québec are dealing with big financial difficulties and with an injury plagued Pierre Lambert, the future in Quebec is in doubt. Pierre Lambert and his friends will have to start winning and find a way to keep Le National in Quebec. \"Lance et Compte\" is a common Quebec French hockey expression, equivalent to the English \"He shoots, he scores\" (the latter was originally one of the catchphrases of hockey commentator Foster Hewitt).

Pierre Lambert is now retired and the agent of Bouchard. Le National de Québec have been playing very poorly for years now and if the team continues losing they might yet again be threatened to move out of the city. With the help of the new coaches, Le National have to find a way to win and fast. \"La Reconquête\" focuses on the love life of Danny Bouchard and Marc Gagnon. Bouchard is rapidly turned into a man he is not by his new mistress Valérie Nantel and could result in a dramatic ending. Marc Gagnon also has to find a way to deal with his emotions as he still has feelings for his ex, Suzie Lambert. \"In Lance et Compte: La Revanche\", Pierre Lambert's son, Guy, is called up by Le National de Québec in the middle of the season.

One improvement was the pilot's environment, now seated in an open cockpit within a short fuselage nacelle rather than entirely exposed on a fuselage beam. Earlier Zögling variants like the SG-38 had also included a nacelle but not the CAT 15's cleaner strut braced wing which dispensed with many flying wires.

It is a red, two-seat sports car with a targa top. Sason, who was working as a freelancer for Saab, made some drawings of a small sports coupé in the early 1960s. As Saab was planning to introduce a sports car model, the company commissioned him to adopt the design for mass production. The project began in January 1963 and in May the assembly of the prototype started at the ASJ. The prototype was first displayed, however, only on 24 April 1965, at the Linköping Sports Centre. For economy reasons, the Catherina utilised many components of the contemporary Saab 96 and shared the same wheelbase, which was longer than the finally accepted design. Its unique feature was its targa top, which could be stowed in the luggage compartment of the car. Stemming from the design of an integral 'roll bar', it was still a new concept in the automotive industry, preceding the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa, which popularized it (and established the name). Sason also designed some other unusual features for the Catherina, such as the roof-mounted headlamps (for longer range), which were not included in the prototype because of the need to make the car fit for mass production.  After test drives on the prototype it was concluded that some more development work was needed. Meanwhile, another prototype, known as Saab MFI13, was prepared by the \"Malmö Flygindustri\" (MFI) and Saab chose it as a basis for its sports car, the Saab Sonett II.

{"query": "Tribochemical reaction films applications beyond lubrication instead of formation process\")\n\n```", "pos": ["Tribocorrosion\nTribocorrosion Tribocorrosion is a material degradation process due to the combined effect of corrosion and wear. The name tribocorrosion expresses the underlying disciplines of tribology and corrosion. Tribology is concerned with the study of friction, lubrication and wear (its name comes from the Greek \"tribo\" meaning to rub) and corrosion is concerned with the chemical and electrochemical interactions between a material, normally a metal, and its environment. As a field of research tribocorrosion is relatively new, but tribocorrosion phenomena have been around ever since machines and installations are being used. Wear is a mechanical material degradation process occurring on rubbing or impacting surfaces, while corrosion involves chemical or electrochemical reactions of the material. Corrosion may accelerate wear and wear may accelerate corrosion. One then speaks of corrosion accelerated wear or wear accelerated corrosion. Both these phenomena, as well as fretting corrosion (which results from small amplitude oscillations between contacting surfaces) fall into the broader category of tribocorrosion. Erosion-corrosion is another tribocorrosion phenomenon involving mechanical and chemical effects: impacting particles or fluids erode a solid surface by abrasion, chipping or fatigue while simultaneously the surface corrodes. Tribocorrosion occurs in many engineering fields. It reduces the life-time of pipes, valves and pumps, of waste incinerators, of mining equipment or of medical implants, and it can affect the safety of nuclear reactors or of transport systems. On the other hand, tribocorrosion phenomena can also be applied to good use, for example in the chemical-mechanical planarization of wafers in the electronics industry or in metal grinding and cutting in presence of aqueous emulsions. Keeping this in mind, we may define tribocorrosion in a more general way independently of the notion of usefulness or damage or of the particular type of mechanical interaction: Tribocorrosion concerns the irreversible transformation of materials or of their function as a result of simultaneous mechanical and chemical/electrochemical interactions between surfaces in relative motion. Biotribocorrosion covers the science of surface transformations resulting from the interactions of mechanical loading and chemical/electrochemical reactions that occur between elements of a tribological system exposed to biological environments. It has been studied for aritificial joint prostheses. It is important to understand material degradation processes for joint implants to achieve longer service life and better safety issues for such devices. While tribocorrosion phenomena may affect many materials, they are most critical for metals, especially the normally corrosion resistant so-called passive metals. The vast majority of corrosion resistant metals and alloys used in engineering (stainless steels, titanium, aluminium etc.) fall into this category. These metals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen or water and they derive their corrosion resistance from the presence at the surface of a thin oxide film, called the passive film, which acts as a protective barrier between the metal and its environment. Passive films are usually just a few atomic layers thick. Nevertheless, they can provide excellent corrosion protection because if damaged accidentally they spontaneously self-heal by metal oxidation. However, when a metal surface is subjected to severe rubbing or to a stream of impacting particles the passive film damage becomes continuous and extensive. The self-healing process may no longer be effective and in addition it requires a high rate of metal oxidation. In other words, the underlying metal will strongly corrode before the protective passive film is reformed, if at all. In such a case, the total material loss due to tribocorrosion will be much higher than the sum of wear and corrosion one would measure in experiments with the same metal where only wear or only corrosion takes place. The example illustrates the fact that the rate of tribocorrosion is not simply the addition of the rate of wear and the rate of corrosion but it is strongly affected by synergistic and antagonistic effects between mechanical and chemical mechanisms. To study such effects in the laboratory, one most often uses mechanical wear testing rigs which are equipped with an electrochemical cell. This permits one to control independently the mechanical and chemical parameters. For example, by imposing a given potential to the rubbing metal one can simulate the oxidation potential of the environment and in addition, under certain conditions, the current flow is a measure of the instantaneous corrosion rate. Volume loss due to electrochemical dissolution can be measured by Faraday's laws of electrolysis and subtracted from total volume loss in tribocorrosion so the sum of mechanical wear loss and the synergies can be calculated. For a deeper understanding tribocorrosion experiments are supplemented by detailed microscopic and analytical studies of the contacting surfaces. At high temperatures, the more rapid generation of oxide due to a combination of temperature and tribological action during sliding wear can generate potentially wear resistant oxide layers known as 'glazes'. Under such circumstances, tribocorrosion can be used potentially in a beneficial way.", "Lubricant\nLubricant A lubricant is a substance, usually organic, introduced to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move. It may also have the function of transmitting forces, transporting foreign particles, or heating or cooling the surfaces. The property of reducing friction is known as lubricity. In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes. Other uses include cooking (oils and fats in use in frying pans, in baking to prevent food sticking), bioapplications on humans (e.g. lubricants for artificial joints), ultrasound examination, medical examination. Lubicants have been in some use for thousands of years. Calcium soaps have been identified on the axles of chariots dated to 1400 BC. Building stones were slid on oil-impregrated lumber in the time of the pyramids. In the Roman era, lubricants were based on olive oil and rapeseed oil, as well as animal fats. The growth of lubrication accelerated in the Industrial Revolution with the accompanying use of metal-based machinery. Relying initially on natural oils, needs for such machinery shifted toward petroleum-based materials early in the 1900s. A breakthrough came with the development of vacuum distillation of petroleum, as described by the Vacuum Oil Company. This technology allowed the purification of very nonvolatile substances, which are common in many lubricants. A good lubricant generally possesses the following characteristics: Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil (most often petroleum fractions, called mineral oils) and less than 10% additives. Vegetable oils or synthetic liquids such as hydrogenated polyolefins, esters, silicones, fluorocarbons and many others are sometimes used as base oils. Additives deliver reduced friction and wear, increased viscosity, improved viscosity index, resistance to corrosion and oxidation, aging or contamination, etc. Non-liquid lubricants include powders (dry graphite, PTFE, molybdenum disulphide, tungsten disulphide, etc.), PTFE tape used in plumbing, air cushion and others. Dry lubricants such as graphite, molybdenum disulphide and tungsten disulphide also offer lubrication at temperatures (up to 350 °C) higher than liquid and oil-based lubricants are able to operate. Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of compacted oxide glaze layers formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature. A large number of additives are used to impart performance characteristics to the lubricants. Modern automotive lubricants contain as many as ten additives, comprising up to 20% of the lubricant, the main families of additives are: In 1999, an estimated 37,300,000 tons of lubricants were consumed worldwide. Automotive applications dominate, but other industrial, marine, and metal working applications are also big consumers of lubricants. Although air and other gas-based lubricants are known (e.g., in fluid bearings), liquid lubricants dominate the market, followed by solid lubricants. Lubricants are generally composed of a majority of base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. Although generally lubricants are based on one type of base oil, mixtures of the base oils also are used to meet performance requirements. The term \"mineral oil\" is used to refer to lubricating base oils derived from crude oil. The American Petroleum Institute (API) designates several types of lubricant base oil:  The lubricant industry commonly extends this group terminology to include: Can also be classified into three categories depending on the prevailing compositions: Petroleum-derived lubricant can also be produced using synthetic hydrocarbons (derived ultimately from petroleum). These include: PTFE: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is typically used as a coating layer on, for example, cooking utensils to provide a non-stick surface. Its usable temperature range up to 350 °C and chemical inertness make it a useful additive in special greases. Under extreme pressures, PTFE powder or solids is of little value as it is soft and flows away from the area of contact. Ceramic or metal or alloy lubricants must be used then. Inorganic solids: Graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of solid lubricants. Some retain their lubricity to very high temperatures. The use of some such materials is sometimes restricted by their poor resistance to oxidation (e.g., molybdenum disulfide degrades above 350 °C in air, but 1100 °C in reducing environments. Metal/alloy: Metal alloys, composites and pure metals can be used as grease additives or the sole constituents of sliding surfaces and bearings. Cadmium and gold are used for plating surfaces which gives them good corrosion resistance and sliding properties, Lead, tin, zinc alloys and various bronze alloys are used as sliding bearings, or their powder can be used to lubricate sliding surfaces alone. Aqueous lubrication is of interest in a number of technological applications. Strongly hydrated brush polymers such as PEG can serve as lubricants at liquid solid interfaces. By continuous rapid exchange of bound water with other free water molecules, these polymer films keep the surfaces separated while maintaining a high fluidity at the brush–brush interface at high compressions, thus leading to a very low coefficient of friction. Biolubricants are derived from vegetable oils and other renewable sources. They usually are triglyceride esters (fats obtained from plants and animals. For lubricant base oil use, the vegetable derived materials are preferred. Common ones include high oleic canola oil, castor oil, palm oil, sunflower seed oil and rapeseed oil from vegetable, and tall oil from tree sources. Many vegetable oils are often hydrolyzed to yield the acids which are subsequently combined selectively to form specialist synthetic esters. Other naturally derived lubricants include lanolin (wool grease, a natural water repellent). Whale oil was a historically important lubricant, with some uses up to the latter part of the 20th century as a friction modifier additive for automatic transmission fluid. In 2008, the biolubricant market was around 1% of UK lubricant sales in a total lubricant market of 840,000 tonnes/year. One of the single largest applications for lubricants, in the form of motor oil, is protecting the internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and powered equipment. Anti-tack or anti-stick coatings are designed to reduce the adhesive condition (stickiness) of a given material. The rubber, hose, and wire and cable industries are the largest consumers of anti-tack products but virtually every industry uses some form of anti-sticking agent. Anti-sticking agents differ from \"lubricants\" in that they are designed to reduce the inherently adhesive qualities of a given compound while lubricants are designed to reduce friction between any two surfaces. Lubricants are typically used to separate moving parts in a system. This separation has the benefit of reducing friction, wear and surface fatigue, together with reduced heat generation, operating noise and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this in several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e., a thin layer of lubricant separates the moving parts. This is analogous to hydroplaning, the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water. This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication. In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures, the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant.. Typically the lubricant-to-surface friction is much less than surface-to-surface friction in a system without any lubrication. Thus use of a lubricant reduces the overall system friction. Reduced friction has the benefit of reducing heat generation and reduced formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency. Lubricants may contain additives known as friction modifiers that chemically bind to metal surfaces to reduce surface friction even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant present for hydrodynamic lubrication, e.g. protecting the valve train in a car engine at startup. Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants are much more effective on account of their high specific heat capacity. Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used to warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled turbocharger is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short (i.e. high flow rate). If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high-speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways, reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure, typically with seized bearings. Non-flowing lubricants such as greases and pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place. Lubricant circulation systems have the benefit of carrying away internally generated debris and external contaminants that get introduced into the system to a filter where they can be removed. Lubricants for machines that regularly generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically contain detergent and dispersant additives to assist in debris and contaminant transport to the filter and removal. Over time the filter will get clogged and require cleaning or replacement, hence the recommendation to change a car's oil filter at the same time as changing the oil. In closed systems such as gear boxes the filter may be supplemented by a magnet to attract any iron fines that get created. It is apparent that in a circulatory system the oil will only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that there are no industry standards by which consumers can readily assess the filtering ability of various automotive filters. Poor automotive filters  significantly reduces the life of the machine (engine) as well as making the system inefficient. Lubricants known as hydraulic fluid are used as the working fluid in hydrostatic power transmission. Hydraulic fluids comprise a large portion of all lubricants produced in the world. The automatic transmission's torque converter is another important application for power transmission with lubricants. Lubricants prevent wear by keeping the moving parts apart. Lubricants may also contain anti-wear or extreme pressure additives to boost their performance against wear and fatigue. Many lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces or that exclude moisture, to prevent corrosion and rust. It reduces corrosion between two metallic surface and avoids contact between these surfaces to avoid immersed corrosion. Lubricants will occupy the clearance between moving parts through the capillary force, thus sealing the clearance. This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts. A further phenomenon that has undergone investigation in relation to high temperature wear prevention and lubrication, is that of a compacted oxide layer glaze formation. Such glazes are generated by sintering a compacted oxide layer. Such glazes are crystalline, in contrast to the amorphous glazes seen in pottery. The required high temperatures arise from metallic surfaces sliding against each other (or a metallic surface against a ceramic surface). Due to the elimination of metallic contact and adhesion by the generation of oxide, friction and wear is reduced. Effectively, such a surface is self-lubricating. As the \"glaze\" is already an oxide, it can survive to very high temperatures in air or oxidising environments. However, it is disadvantaged by it being necessary for the base metal (or ceramic) having to undergo some wear first to generate sufficient oxide debris. It is estimated that 40% of all lubricants are released into the environment. Common disposal methods include recycling, burning, landfill and discharge into water, though typically disposal in landfill and discharge into water are strictly regulated in most countries, as even small amount of lubricant can contaminate a large amount of water. Most regulations permit a threshold level of lubricant that may be present in waste streams and companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually in treating their waste waters to get to acceptable levels. Burning the lubricant as fuel, typically to generate electricity, is also governed by regulations mainly on account of the relatively high level of additives present. Burning generates both airborne pollutants and ash rich in toxic materials, mainly heavy metal compounds. Thus lubricant burning takes place in specialized facilities that have incorporated special scrubbers to remove airborne pollutants and have access to landfill sites with permits to handle the toxic ash. Unfortunately, most lubricant that ends up directly in the environment is due to general public discharging it onto the ground, into drains and directly into landfills as trash. Other direct contamination sources include runoff from roadways, accidental spillages, natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages. Improvement in filtration technologies and processes has now made recycling a viable option (with rising price of base stock and crude oil). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated much the same as virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (distilling, isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks. Occasionally, unused lubricant requires disposal. The best course of action in such situations is to return it to the manufacturer where it can be processed as a part of fresh batches. \"Environment:\" Lubricants both fresh and used can cause considerable damage to the environment mainly due to their high potential of serious water pollution. Further the additives typically contained in lubricant can be toxic to flora and fauna. In used fluids the oxidation products can be toxic as well. Lubricant persistence in the environment largely depends upon the base fluid, however if very toxic additives are used they may negatively affect the persistence. Lanolin lubricants are non-toxic making them the environmental alternative which is safe for both users and the environment.", "Lubrication\nLubrication Lubrication is the process or technique of using a lubricant to reduce friction and/or wear in a contact between two surfaces. The study of lubrication is a discipline in the field of tribology. Lubricants can be solids (such as Molybdenum disulfide MoS), solid/liquid dispersions (such as grease), liquids (such as oil or water), liquid-liquid dispersions or gases.  Fluid-lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or completely carried by hydrodynamic or hydrostatic pressure, which reduces solid body interactions (and consequently friction and wear). Depending on the degree of surface separation, different lubrication regimes can be distinguished. Adequate lubrication allows smooth, continuous operation of machine elements, reduces the rate of wear, and prevents excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, components can rub destructively against each other, causing heat, local welding, destructive damage and failure. As the load increases on the contacting surfaces, three distinct situations can be observed with respect to the mode of lubrication, which are called lubrication regimes:  Besides supporting the load the lubricant may have to perform other functions as well, for instance it may cool the contact areas and remove wear products. While carrying out these functions the lubricant is constantly replaced from the contact areas either by the relative movement (hydrodynamics) or by externally induced forces. Lubrication is required for correct operation of mechanical systems such as pistons, pumps, cams, bearings, turbines, cutting tools etc. where without lubrication the pressure between the surfaces in close proximity would generate enough heat for rapid surface damage which in a coarsened condition may literally weld the surfaces together, causing seizure. In some applications, such as piston engines, the film between the piston and the cylinder wall also seals the combustion chamber, preventing combustion gases from escaping into the crankcase."], "neg": ["Tibric acid\nTibric acid Tibric acid is a sulfamylbenzoic acid that acts as a hypolipidemic agent.

Until recently, it was the only species of bryophyte known with this combination of characteristics, but a second species \"Cryptothallus hirsutus\" was discovered in Costa Rica in 1996. The infecting fungus is a basidiomycete, which is also the case in fungi associated with the related genera \"Aneura\" and \"Riccardia\".

Other names, such as \"thallophytes\", \"lower plants\", and \"spore plants\" are also occasionally used. As a group, Cryptogamae are the opposite of the Phanerogamae (Greek , ' = \"visible\") or Spermatophyta (Greek , ' = \"seed\" and , \"\" = \"plant\"), the seed plants. The best known groups of cryptogams are algae, lichens, mosses and ferns, but it also includes non-photosynthetic organisms traditionally classified as plants, such as fungi, slime molds, and bacteria.The classification is now deprecated in Linnaean taxonomy. At one time, the cryptogams were formally recognised as a group within the plant kingdom. In his system for classification of all known plants and animals, Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) divided the plant kingdom into 24 classes, one of which was the \"Cryptogamia\". This included all plants with \"concealed\" reproductive organs. He divided Cryptogamia into four orders: Algae, Musci (bryophytes), Filices (ferns), and Fungi. Not all cryptogams are treated as part of the plant kingdom; the fungi, in particular, are regarded as a separate kingdom, more closely related to animals than plants, while blue-green algae are now regarded as a phylum of bacteria. Therefore, in contemporary plant systematics, \"Cryptogamae\" is not a taxonomically coherent group, but is cladistically polyphyletic. However, all organisms known as cryptogams belong to the field traditionally studied by botanists and the names of all cryptogams are regulated by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\".

The \"pocket books\" were originally published irregularly (about 6 times a year) until 1987 and monthly since. They are roughly A5-sized (digest size) and about 250 pages thick. Each book has about eight stories, but the numbers of stories can vary widely from issue to issue. As of 2006, there were more than 300 books. Almost all stories come from European publishers - namely Mondadori/Disney Italy from Italy and, more recently, Egmont from Denmark. Most of the artists are from Italy (among the most famous and internationally renowned being Romano Scarpa, Marco Rota, Pier Lorenzo De Vita, Massimo De Vita, Giorgio Cavazzano, Giovan Battista Carpi, Luciano Bottaro) with a minority of Danish artists (such as Flemming Andersen), and very few stories are drawn by Spanish and Argentinian artists. Just like their larger, comic book-sized European Disney comic counterparts and as is common with North-American superhero comics, hardly any story published in the \"pocket books\" is made by one single person, instead each story is a combined effort. An author writes a story for which the production company assigns an artist whose unique style they think most resembles the story's particular spirit, then the artist's drawings are completed, again as by management directions, first by a particular inker and then a particular colorist. These groupings can at times be only loose and variable from story to story (especially stable author-artist groupings are rare), but particular artist-inker-colorist groupings can last long enough to define what later is recognized as an artist's defined \"style period\". It was not until the late 1990s that the production companies began to print at least author and artist of each Disney story in their publications. Until issue #118, a particular limitation of the \"pocket books\" out of economical reasons was that only half of the pages were printed in color, while for the other half simply the uncolored line art was printed. This was done in an alternating routine so that one pair of pages (left and right page) one was looking at was black and white, and turning to the next pair of pages they were in color, etc. It was not until issue #119 (spring 1987, shortly before the move to monthly issues) that the \"pocket books\" were printed in full color. In later reprints, these early issues were published in all-color. In the late 2000s, \"mini\" pocket books have also appeared. These mini pocket books are smaller (A6-sized rather than A5-sized) but have slightly more pages, and consist almost exclusively of reprints of stories in previously appeared full-size pocket books, rather than all-new material. A special feature of the early issues of pocket books were the so-called framework stories. In these early days, the stories used to be connected with each other by a framework story, forming a general story line throughout the entire book. For every of those early issues, the publishers mostly chose unrelated stories from a large pool, and it was only after those stories had been chosen that a fitting framework would be written, then drawn in a sub-standard quality style by artist Giuseppe Perego. As the feature gradually fell out of use, Perego was partly replaced by Giancarlo Gatti, an artist whose quality is more on par with that of the usual production level and who like Perego often publishes full-length main stories instead of only doing \"filler\" frameworks in between these. The framework feature was gradually dropped during the 1980s (roughly between the issues #80-#100), as nowadays each story is usually completely independent from the other stories in the same issue. Since the same issue as full-color was introduced, the \"pocket books\" also feature pictures of Disney characters on their spines, a feature especially appealing to collectors as these pictures make it instantly apparent if an issue is missing when the \"pocket books\" are lined up on a cupboard. The first spine-assembly picture ran from 1987 until late 1991/early 1992, since then each spine picture (usually) spans a year (= 12 issues). The same stories, which are mostly written and drawn by Italian writers and artists, are translated into different languages and appear in each country roughly about the same time, but there are differences of one or two months between the publishing schedules of different countries. As there was no connection between issues other than the recurring cast of characters, the early issues (until about #30?) were mostly published in different order all over Europe, so the German #3 for instance is not the same as the Danish, French, or Finnish #3.

Soriano became fascinated with reading as a child and obtained a college degree in Spanish literature after studying with a professor who visited his village twice a month. A primary school teacher by profession, Soriano developed the idea after witnessing first-hand the power reading had on his students, most of whom had lived through intense life conflicts at a young age. Starting in the late 1990s, Soriano traveled to communities in Colombia's Caribbean Sea hinterlands with a portable library, which began with 70 books.

Soriano asked Gossaín for a copy of his book to be distributed on the Biblioburro, details that Gossaín broadcast on his radio program. The response created a flood of book donations and Soriano's collection soon expanded to 4,800 volumes. Currently, construction of a small library building funded by a local financial company is half-finished due to lack of funds. Additional funding is also provided by the director of a community library, located nearly from the Caribbean shore in Santa Maria, who hired Soriano as a satellite employee in order to share a portion of its US$7,000 annual budget.

Robert de Graff continued to refine his selections with movie tie-ins and greater emphasis on mystery novels, particularly those of Christie and Erle Stanley Gardner. Pocket and its imitators thrived during World War II because material shortages worked to their advantage. During the war, Pocket sued Avon Books for copyright infringement: among other issues, a New York state court found Pocket did not have an exclusive right to the pocket-sized format (both Pocket and Avon published paperback editions of Leslie Charteris' \"The Saint\" mystery series, among others). Phyllis E. Grann who would later become the first woman CEO of a major publishing firm was promoted to run Pocket Books under then CEO Richard E. Snyder. Grann left for Putnam in 1976.

The size of offshore lifts can be reduced by making the construction modular, with each module being constructed onshore and then lifted using a crane vessel into place onto the platform. A number of very large crane vessels were built in the 1970s which allow very large single modules weighing up to 14,000 tonnes to be fabricated and then lifted into place. Specialist floating hotel vessels known as flotels are used to accommodate workers during the construction and hook-up phases. This is a high cost activity due to the limited space and access to materials. Oil platforms are key fixed installations from which drilling and production activity is carried out. Drilling rigs are either floating vessels for deeper water or jack-up designs which are a barge with liftable legs. Both of these types of vessel are constructed in marine yards but are often involved during the construction phase to pre-drill some production wells.  Other key factors in offshore construction are the weather window which defines periods of relatively light weather during which continuous construction or other offshore activity can take place. Safety is another key construction parameter, the main hazard obviously being a fall into the sea from which speedy recovery in cold waters is essential. The main types of vessels used for pipe laying are the \"Derrick Barge (DB)\", the \"Pipelay Barge (LB)\" and the \"Derrick/Lay barge (DLB)\" combination. Diving bells in offshore construction are mainly used in water depths greater than , less than that, the divers use a metal basket driven from an \"A\" frame from the deck. The basket is lowered to the water level, then the divers enter the water from it to a maximum of . Bells can go to , but are normally used at . Offshore construction includes foundations engineering, structural design, construction, and/or repair of offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:"], "neg": ["Offshore wind power\nOffshore wind power Offshore wind power or offshore wind energy is the use of wind farms constructed in bodies of water, usually in the ocean on the continental shelf, to harvest wind energy to generate electricity.  Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s electricity generation is higher per amount of capacity installed, and NIMBY opposition to construction is usually much weaker. Unlike the typical use of the term \"offshore\" in the marine industry, offshore wind power includes inshore water areas such as lakes, fjords and sheltered coastal areas, utilizing traditional fixed-bottom wind turbine technologies, as well as deeper-water areas utilizing floating wind turbines. At the end of 2017, the total worldwide offshore wind power capacity was 18.8 GW.  All the largest offshore wind farms are currently in northern Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Germany, which together account for over two thirds of the total offshore wind power installed worldwide. As of September 2018, the 659 MW Walney Extension in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world .  The Hornsea Wind Farm under construction in the United Kingdom will become the largest when completed, at 1,200 MW.  Other projects are in the planning stage, including Dogger Bank in the United Kingdom at 4.8 GW, and Greater Changhua in Taiwan at 2.4 GW. The cost of offshore wind power has historically been higher than that of onshore wind generation, but costs have been decreasing rapidly in recent years and in Europe has been price competitive with conventional power sources since 2017. Europe is the world leader in offshore wind power, with the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby) being installed in Denmark in 1991.  In 2009, the average nameplate capacity of an offshore wind turbine in Europe was about 3 MW, and the capacity of future turbines was expected to increase to 5 MW. In 2010, the US Energy Information Agency said \"offshore wind power is the most expensive energy generating technology being considered for large scale deployment\". The 2010 state of offshore wind power presented economic challenges significantly greater than onshore systems, with prices in the range of 2.5-3.0 million Euro/MW.  That year, Siemens and Vestas were turbine suppliers for 90% of offshore wind power, while DONG Energy, Vattenfall and E.on were the leading offshore operators. In 2011, DONG Energy estimated that while offshore wind turbines were not yet competitive with fossil fuels, they would be in 15 years.  Until then, state funding and pension funds would be needed.  At the end of 2011, there were 53 European offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with an operating capacity of 3,813 MW, while 5,603 MW was under construction. Offshore wind farms worth €8.5 billion ($11.4 billion) were under construction in European waters in 2011. In 2012, Bloomberg estimated that energy from offshore wind turbines cost () per MWh. A 2013 comprehensive review of the engineering aspects of turbines like the sizes used onshore, including the electrical connections and converters, considered that the industry had in general been overoptimistic about the benefits-to-costs ratio and concluded that the \"offshore wind market doesn’t look as if it is going to be big\". In 2013, offshore wind power contributed to 1,567 MW of the total 11,159 MW of wind power capacity constructed that year. By January 2014, 69 offshore wind farms had been constructed in Europe with an average annual rated capacity of 482 MW.  The total installed capacity of offshore wind farms in European waters reached 6,562 MW. The United Kingdom had by far the largest capacity with 3,681 MW.  Denmark was second with 1,271 MW installed and Belgium was third with 571 MW.  Germany came fourth with 520 MW, followed by the Netherlands (247 MW), Sweden (212 MW), Finland (26 MW), Ireland (25 MW), Spain (5 MW), Norway (2 MW) and Portugal (2 MW). At the end of 2014, 3,230 turbines at 84 offshore wind farms across 11 European countries had been installed and grid-connected, making a total capacity of 11,027 MW. Outside of Europe, the Chinese government had set ambitious targets of 5 gigawatt (GW) of installed offshore wind capacity by 2015 and 30 GW by 2020 that would eclipse capacity in other countries.  However, in May 2014 the capacity of offshore wind power in China was only 565 MW.  Offshore capacity in China increased by 832 MW in 2016, of which 636 MW were made in China. The offshore wind construction market remains quite concentrated. By the end of 2015, Siemens Wind Power had installed 63% of the world's 11 GW offshore wind power capacity; Vestas had 19%, Senvion came third with 8% and Adwen 6%. About 12 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe, with 3,755 MW of that coming online during 2015. Costs of offshore wind power are decreasing much faster than expected.  By 2016, four contracts (Borssele and Kriegers) were already below the lowest of the predicted 2050 prices. Projections for 2020 estimate an offshore wind farm capacity of 40 GW in European waters, which would provide 4% of the European Union's demand of electricity. The European Wind Energy Association has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the United States. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted in 2016 that offshore wind power will grow to 8% of ocean economy by 2030, and that its industry will employ 435,000 people, adding $230 billion of value. Almost all currently operating offshore wind farms employ fixed foundation turbines, with the exception of a few pilot projects. Fixed foundation offshore wind turbines have fixed foundations underwater, and are installed in relatively shallow waters of up to 50–60 m. Types of underwater structures include monopile, tripod, and jacketed, with various foundations at the sea floor including monopile or multiple piles, gravity base, and caissons. Offshore turbines require different types of bases for stability, according to the depth of water.  To date a number of different solutions exist: Monopiles up to 11 m diameter at 2,000 tonnes can be made, but the largest so far are 1,300 tons which is below the 1,500 tonnes limit of some crane vessels.  The other turbine components are much smaller. For locations with depths over about 60–80 m, fixed foundations are uneconomical or technically unfeasible, and floating wind turbine anchored to the ocean floor are needed. Hywind is the world's first full-scale floating wind turbine, installed in the North Sea off Norway in 2009.  Hywind Scotland, commissioned in October 2017, is the first operational floating wind farm, with a capacity of 30 MW. Other kinds of floating turbines have been deployed, and more projects are planned. Although the great majority of onshore and all large-scale offshore wind turbines currently installed are horizontal axis, vertical axis wind turbines have been proposed for use in offshore installations. Thanks to the installation offshore and their lower center of gravity, these turbines can in principle be built bigger than horizontal axis turbines, with proposed designs of up to 20 MW capacity per turbine. This could improve the economy of scale of offshore wind farms. However, there are no current large-scale demonstrations of this technology. The advantage of locating wind turbines offshore is that the wind is much stronger off the coasts, and unlike wind over the continent, offshore breezes can be strong in the afternoon, matching the time when people are using the most electricity.  Offshore turbines can also be located close to the load centers along the coasts, such as large cities, eliminating the need for new long-distance transmission lines. However, there are several disadvantages of offshore installations, related to more expensive installation, difficulty of access, and harsher conditions for the units. Locating wind turbines offshore exposes the units to high humidity, salt water and salt water spray which negatively affect service life, cause corrosion and oxidation, increase maintenance and repair costs and in general make every aspect of installation and operation much more difficult, time-consuming, more dangerous and far more expensive than sites on land.  The humidity and temperature is controlled by air conditioning the sealed nacelle. Sustained high-speed operation and generation also increases wear, maintenance and repair requirements proportionally. The cost of the turbine represents just one third to one half of total costs in offshore projects today, the rest comes from infrastructure, maintenance, and oversight.  Costs for foundations, installation, electrical connections and operation and maintenance (O&M) are a large share of the total for offshore installations compared to onshore wind farms. The cost of installation and electrical connection also increases rapidly with distance from shore and water depth. Other limitations of offshore wind power are related to the still limited number of installations.  The offshore wind industry is not yet fully industrialized, as supply bottlenecks still exist as of 2017. Offshore wind farms tend to have larger turbines when compared to onshore installations, and the trend is towards a continued increase in size. Economics of offshore wind farms tend to favor larger turbines, as installation and grid connection costs decrease per unit energy produced. Moreover, offshore wind farms do not have the same restriction in size of onshore wind turbines, such as availability of land or transportation requirements. Maintenance of offshore wind farms is much more expensive than for onshore installations. For example, a single technician in a pickup truck can quickly, easily and safely access turbines on land in almost any weather conditions, exit his or her vehicle and simply walk over to and into the turbine tower to gain access to the entire unit within minutes of arriving onsite.  Similar access to offshore turbines involves driving to a dock or pier, loading necessary tools and supplies into boat, a voyage to the wind turbine(s), securing the boat to the turbine structure, transferring tools and supplies to and from boat to turbine and turbine to boat and performing the rest of the steps in reverse order.  In addition to standard safety gear such as a hardhat, gloves and safety glasses, an offshore turbine technician may be required to wear a life vest, waterproof or water-resistant clothing and perhaps even a survival suit if working, sea and atmospheric conditions make rapid rescue in case of a fall into the water unlikely or impossible. Typically at least two technicians skilled and trained in operating and handling large power boats at sea are required for tasks that one technician with a driver's license can perform on land in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost. Auctions in 2016 have reached costs of €54.5 per MWh at the 700 MW Borssele 3&4 due to government tender and size, and €49.90 per MWh (without transmission) at the 600 MW Kriegers Flak. In September 2017 contracts were awarded in the UK for a strike price of £57.50 per MWh making the price cheaper than nuclear and competitive with gas. In September 2018 contracts were awarded for Vineyard Wind, Massachusetts, USA at a cost of between $65-$74 per MWh . It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Offshore wind resource characteristics span a range of spatial and temporal scales and field data on external conditions.  For the North Sea, wind turbine energy is around 30 kWh/m of sea area, per year, delivered to grid.  The energy per sea area is roughly independent of turbine size.  A number of things are necessary in order to attain the necessary information for planning the commissioning of an offshore wind farm.  The first information required is offshore wind characteristics. Additional necessary data for planning includes water depth, currents, seabed, migration, and wave action, all of which drive mechanical and structural loading on potential turbine configurations.  Other factors include marine growth, salinity, icing, and the geotechnical characteristics of the sea or lake bed. Existing hardware for measurements includes Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR), radar, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), and remote satellite sensing, although these technologies should be assessed and refined, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. Because of the many factors involved, one of the biggest difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads.  Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems.  Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors.  Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines. Corrosion is also a serious problem and requires detailed design considerations.  The prospect of remote monitoring of corrosion looks very promising using expertise utilised by the offshore oil/gas industry and other large industrial plants. Some of the guidelines for designing offshore wind farms are IEC 61400-3, but in the US several other standards are necessary.  In the EU, different national standards are to be straightlined into more cohesive guidelines to lower costs. The standards requires that a loads analysis is based on site-specific external conditions such as wind, wave and currents. The planning and permitting phase can cost more than $10 million, take 5–7 years and have an uncertain outcome. The industry puts pressure on the governments to improve the processes.  In Denmark, many of these phases have been deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles, and this policy has been extended for coastal wind farms with a concept called ’one-stop-shop’.  The United States introduced a similar model called \"Smart from the Start\" in 2012. Turbines are much less accessible when offshore (requiring the use of a service vessel or helicopter for routine access, and a jackup rig for heavy service such as gearbox replacement), and thus reliability is more important than for an onshore turbine. Some wind farms located far from possible onshore bases have service teams living on site in offshore accommodation units. A maintenance organization performs maintenance and repairs of the components, spending almost all its resources on the turbines. The conventional way of inspecting the blades is for workers to rappel down the blade, taking a day per turbine. Some farms inspect the blades of three turbines per day by photographing them from the monopile through a 600mm lens, avoiding to go up. Others use camera drones. Because of their remote nature, prognosis and health-monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines will become much more necessary. They would enable better planning just-in-time maintenance, thereby reducing the operations and maintenance costs. According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government (supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future), making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design. Reducing this barrier would contribute to the education of engineers specializing in wind energy. As the first offshore wind farms reach their end of life, a demolition industry develops to recycle them at a cost of DKK 2-4 million per MW, to be guaranteed by the owner. The first offshore wind farm to be decommissioned was Yttre Stengrund in Sweden in November 2015. Offshore wind farms have very low global warming potential per unit of electricity generated, comparable to that of onshore wind farms. Offshore installations also have the advantage of limited impact of noise and on the landscape compared to land-based projects. While the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades, there is still a great deal of uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment. Common environmental concerns associated with offshore wind developments include:  The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of offshore wind energy. Most of the current projects are in waters in Europe and East Asia. There are also several proposed developments in North America. Projects are under development in the United States in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast.  In January 2012, a \"Smart for the Start\" regulatory approach was introduced, designed to expedite the siting process while incorporating strong environmental protections.  Specifically, the Department of Interior approved “wind energy areas” off the coast where projects can move through the regulatory approval process more quickly.  The first offshore wind farm in the USA is the 30-megawatt, 5 turbine Block Island Wind Farm which was commissioned in December 2016. Another offshore wind farm that is in the planning phase is off the coast of Virginia Beach. On August 3, 2018, Dominion Energy announced its two wind turbine pilot program that will be 27 miles offshore from Virgina Beach. The area is undergoing a survey that will last for 4-6 weeks. Canadian wind power in the province of Ontario is pursuing several proposed locations in the Great Lakes, including the suspended Trillium Power Wind 1 approximately 20 km from shore and over 400 MW in capacity.  Other Canadian projects include one on the Pacific west coast. India is looking at the potential of offshore wind power plants, with a 100 MW demonstration plant being planned off the coast of Gujarat (2014). In 2013, a group of organizations, led by Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) started project FOWIND (Facilitating Offshore Wind in India) to identify potential zones for development of off-shore wind power in India and to stimulate R & D activities in this area. In 2014 FOWIND commissioned Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) to undertake pre-feasibility studies in eight zones in Tamil Nadu which have been identified as having potential. Most of offshore wind farms are currently in northern Europe.  The United Kingdom and Germany alone accounted for roughly two thirds of the total offshore wind power capacity installed worldwide in 2016. Other countries, such as China, are rapidly expanding their offshore wind power capacity.", "Offshore aquaculture\nOffshore aquaculture Offshore aquaculture, also known as open ocean aquaculture, is an emerging approach to mariculture or marine farming where fish farms are moved some distance offshore. The farms are positioned in deeper and less sheltered waters, where ocean currents are stronger than they are inshore. Existing ‘offshore’ developments fall mainly into the category of exposed areas rather than fully offshore. As maritime classification society, DNV GL, has stated, development and knowledge-building are needed in several fields for the available deeper water opportunities to be realized. One of the concerns with inshore aquaculture is that discarded nutrients and feces can settle below the farm on the seafloor and damage the benthic ecosystem. According to its proponents, the wastes from aquaculture that has been moved offshore tend to be swept away from the site and diluted. Moving aquaculture offshore also provides more space where aquaculture production can expand to meet the increasing demands for fish. It avoids many of the conflicts that occur with other marine resource users in the more crowded inshore waters, though there can still be user conflicts offshore. Critics are concerned about issues such as the ongoing consequences of using antibiotics and other drugs and the possibilities of cultured fish escaping and spreading disease among wild fish. Aquaculture is the most rapidly expanding food industry in the world as a result of declining wild fisheries stocks and profitable business. In 2008, aquaculture provided 45.7% of the fish produced globally for human consumption; increasing at a mean rate of 6.6% a year since 1970. In 1970, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) grant brought together a group of oceanographers, engineers and marine biologists to explore whether offshore aquaculture, which was then considered a futuristic activity, was feasible. In the United States, the future of offshore aquaculture technology within federal waters has become much talked-about. As many commercial operations show, it is now technically possible to culture finfish, shellfish, and seaweeds using offshore aquaculture technology. Major challenges for the offshore aquaculture industry involve designing and deploying cages that can withstand storms, dealing with the logistics of working many kilometers from land, and finding species that are sufficiently profitable to cover the costs of rearing fish in exposed offshore areas. To withstand the high energy offshore environment, farms must be built to be more robust than those inshore. However, the design of the offshore technology is developing rapidly, aimed at reducing cost and maintenance. While the ranching systems currently used for tuna use open net cages at the surface of the sea (as is done also in salmon farming), the offshore technology usually uses submersible cages. These large rigid cages – each one able to hold many thousands of fish – are anchored on the sea floor, but can move up and down the water column. They are attached to buoys on the surface which frequently contain a mechanism for feeding and storage for equipment. Similar technology is being used in waters near the Bahamas, China, the Philippines, Portugal, Puerto Rico, and Spain. By submerging cages or shellfish culture systems, wave effects are minimized and interference with boating and shipping is reduced. Offshore farms can be made more efficient and safer if remote control is used, and technologies such as an 18-tonne buoy that feeds and monitors fish automatically over long periods are being developed. Multi-functional use of offshore waters can lead to more sustainable aquaculture \"in areas that can be simultaneously used for other activities such as energy production\". Operations for finfish and shellfish are being developed. For example, the Hubb-Sea World Research Institutes’ project to convert a retired oil platform 10 nm off the southern California coast to an experimental offshore aquaculture facility. The institute plans to grow mussels and red abalone on the actual platform, as well as white seabass, striped bass, bluefin tuna, California halibut and California yellowtail in floating cages. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), or polyculture, occurs when species which must be fed, such as finfish, are cultured alongside species which can feed on dissolved nutrients, such as seaweeds, or organic wastes, such as suspension feeders and deposit feeders. This sustainable method could solve several problems with offshore aquaculture. The method is being pioneered in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere. Roaming cages have been envisioned as the \"next generation technology\" for offshore aquaculture. These are large mobile cages powered by thrusters and able to take advantage of ocean currents. One idea is that juvenile tuna, starting out in mobile cages in Mexico, could reach Japan after a few months, matured and ready for the market. However, implementing such ideas will have regulatory and legal implications. As oceans industrialise, conflicts are increasing among the users of marine space. This competition for marine space is developing in a context where natural resources can be seen as publicly owned. There can be conflict with the tourism industry, recreational fishers, wild harvest fisheries and the siting of marine renewable energy installations. The problems can be aggravated by the remoteness of many marine areas, and difficulties with monitoring and enforcement. On the other hand, remote sites can be chosen that avoid conflicts with other users, and allow large scale operations with resulting economies of scale. Offshore systems can provide alternatives for countries with few suitable inshore sites, like Spain. The ecological impacts of offshore aquaculture are somewhat uncertain because it is still largely in the research stage.  Many of the concerns over potential offshore aquaculture impacts are paralleled by similar, well established concerns over inshore aquaculture practices. One of the concerns with inshore farms is that discarded nutrients and feces can settle on the seafloor and disturb the benthos. The \"dilution of nutrients\" that occurs in deeper water is a strong reason to move coastal aquaculture offshore into the open ocean. How much nutrient pollution and damage to the seafloor occurs depends on the feed conversion efficiency of the species, the flushing rate and the size of the operation. However, dissolved and particulate nutrients are still released to the environment. Future offshore farms will probably be much larger than inshore farms today, and will therefore generate more waste. The point at which the capacity of offshore ecosystems to assimilate waste from offshore aquaculture operations will be exceeded is yet to be defined. As with the inshore aquaculture of carnivorous fish, a large proportion of the feed comes from wild forage fish. Except for a few countries, offshore aquaculture has focused predominantly on high value carnivorous fish. If the industry attempts to expand with this focus then the supply of these wild fish will become ecologically unsustainable. The expense of offshore systems means it is important to avoid fish escapes. However, it is likely there will be escapes as the offshore industry expands. This could have significant consequences for native species, even if the farmed fish are inside their native range. Submersible cages are fully closed and therefore escapes can only occur through damage to the structure. Offshore cages must withstand the high energy of the environment and attacks by predators such as sharks. The outer netting is made of Spectra – a super-strong polyethylene fibre – wrapped tightly around the frame, leaving no slack for predators to grip. However, the fertilised eggs of cod are able to pass through the cage mesh in ocean enclosures. Compared to inshore aquaculture, disease problems currently appear to be much reduced when farming offshore. For example, parasitic infections that occur in mussels cultured offshore are much smaller than those cultured inshore. However, new species are now being farmed offshore although little is known about their ecology and epidemiology. The implications of transmitting pathogens between such farmed species and wild species \"remains a large and unanswered question\". Spreading of pathogens between fish stocks is a major issue in disease control. Static offshore cages may help minimize direct spreading, as there may be greater distances between aquaculture production areas. However, development of roaming cage technology could bring about new issues with disease transfer and spread. The high level of carnivorous aquaculture production results in an increased demand for live aquatic animals for production and breeding purposes such as bait, broodstock and milt. This can result in spread of disease across species barriers. Aquaculture is encouraged by many governments as a way to generate jobs and income, particularly when wild fisheries have been run down. However, this may not apply to offshore aquaculture. Offshore aquaculture entails high equipment and supply costs, and therefore will be under severe pressure to lower labor costs through automated production technologies. Employment is likely to expand more at processing facilities than grow-out industries as offshore aquaculture develops. Norway and the United States are currently (2008) making the main investments in the design of offshore cages. In 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) sub-committee on aquaculture made the following assessments:  The sub-committee recommended the FAO \"should work towards clarifying the technical and legal terminology related to offshore aquaculture in order to avoid confusion.\" In 2002, the European Commission issued the following policy statement on aquaculture: By 2008, European offshore systems were operating in Norway, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Croatia, Portugal and Libya. In Ireland, as part of their National Development Plan, it is envisioned that over the period 2007–2013, technology associated with offshore aquaculture systems will be developed, including: \"sensor systems for feeding, biomass and health monitoring, feed control, telemetry and communications [and] cage design, materials, structural testing and modelling.\" Moving aquaculture offshore into the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) can cause complications with regulations. In the United States, regulatory control of the coastal states generally extends to 3 nm, while federal waters (or EEZ) extend to 200 nm offshore. Therefore, offshore aquaculture can be sited outside the reach of state law but within federal jurisdiction. As of 2010, \"all commercial aquaculture facilities have been sited in nearshore waters under state or territorial jurisdiction.\" However, \"unclear regulatory processes\" and \"technical uncertainties related to working in offshore areas\" have hindered progress. The five offshore research projects and commercial operations in the US – in New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and California – are all in federal waters. In June 2011, the \"National Sustainable Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2011\" was introduced to the House of Representatives \"to establish a regulatory system and research program for sustainable offshore aquaculture in the United States exclusive economic zone\". By 2005, offshore aquaculture was present in 25 countries, both as experimental and commercial farms. Market demand means that the most offshore farming efforts are directed towards raising finfish. Two commercial operations in the US, and a third in the Bahamas are using submersible cages to raise high-value carnivorous finfish, such as moi, cobia, and mutton snapper. Submersible cages are also being used in experimental systems for halibut, haddock, cod, and summer flounder in New Hampshire waters, and for amberjack, red drum, snapper, pompano, and cobia in the Gulf of Mexico. The offshore aquaculture of shellfish grown in suspended culture systems, like scallops and mussels, is gaining ground. Suspended culture systems include methods where the shellfish are grown on a tethered rope or suspended from a floating raft in net containers. Mussels in particular can survive the high physical stress levels which occur in the volatile environments that occur in offshore waters. Finfish species must be feed regularly, but shellfish do not, which can reduce costs. The University of New Hampshire in the US has conducted research on the farming of blue mussels submerged in an open ocean environment. They have found that when farmed in less polluted waters offshore, the mussels develop more flesh with lighter shells.", "GREEN Cell Shipping\nGREEN Cell Shipping The GREEN cell shipping concept is a new concept for powering merchant shipping vessels using containerized power units and a global logistics chain to manage these containers. GREEN cell stands for Global Renewable Electrical Energy Network cell. The concept resulted from a thought experiment process involving engineers working for the ABB Group that took place on March 13, 2009 in Oslo, Norway. The concept was subsequently introduced in an ABB magazine, and remains under development, as part of an open innovation process. The propulsion of merchant ships is responsible for approximately 4% of global carbon-dioxide emissions. The industry itself estimated its carbon footprint at 3.3% in 2007. The industry responded officially as early as 2003 by calling for measures to limit or reduce the emissions from international shipping. In order to envision solutions to this challenge, a team of engineers and consultants associated with ABB set up a thought experiment that would pose the question: \"How could you power the commercial fleet without fossil fuels?\" The core team consisted of three electrical engineers: Jaakko Aho, Jukka Varis and Klaus Vänska, all of Finland. This group laid down a core set of design principles around fossil-free marine propulsion, and described a hypothetical system that was later called the GREEN Cell shipping concept. The GREEN Cell is at the core of the shipping concept. Each GREEN cell is envisaged as a container-sized source of electricity, based on inherent chemical energy (battery), in addition to solar energy and wind energy. Each cell provides electricity to the ship's network. The electrical power potential of each GREEN cell depends on the sum of the power in the battery, the size of solar panel area obtained, the efficiency of the solar panel and the efficiency of the wind power system. Initial designs for a GREEN cell proposed that each GREEN Cell opens two doors length-wise, thus covering neighboring containers as well. The inside of the doors, and much of the exposed surface of the container are mounted with solar panels. Thus, a typical container ship could cover its entire surface with solar energy panels. One GREEN Cell produces as much as of solar panel surface area. This equates to roughly 12 kW. 100 such containers could thus conceivably produce 1.2 MW. Alternate calculations show that such a system would retrieve 500 Watts per m. Multiplied by the approximately 20,000 m of surface area on a large container ship like Emma Maersk would give 10 MW of solar energy. An extendable vertical-axis windmill emerges from one side of the container. A vertical-axis windmill is preferred as it introduces less resistance to the forward motion of the ship and disturbs ship stability less than horizontal-axis windmills. The battery of the GREEN cell takes up the remainder of the space in the container. Designers describe the potential battery as either an optimised lithium-ion battery, or a sodium-sulfur one. Like a ship that takes refrigerated containers, a GREEN Cell-equipped ship would have an electrical connection to a number of containers. In this case, instead of feeding electricity to the refrigerated units, the ship would pull power from the containers. The GREEN Cell ship carries as many as several hundred GREEN Cells, adding weight to the ship and subtracting from available cargo space. Conversely, the GREEN Cell ship forgoes a typical diesel engine (weighing roughly 75 tons), a frequency converter (weighing roughly 25 tons) and petroleum fuel tanks (as much as 3000 tons). A network of floating power stations placed along major trade routes either recharge a ship’s GREEN Cells, or simply switch them out (like a traditional container port). These create electricity from green sources like wave power generators, wind turbines, a flywheel-driving water density column, solar panels and current-driven turbines. Container terminals carry a large supply of ready-to-go GREEN Cells. These switch out GREEN Cells on ships just like a container port unloads and reloads a container ship. Thus the GREEN Cell system serves both deepsea merchant marine traffic and coastal cabotage.", "Rigs-to-Reefs\nRigs-to-Reefs Rigs-to-Reefs (RTR) is the practice of converting decommissioned offshore oil and petroleum rigs into artificial reefs. Such biotic reefs have been created from oil rigs in the United States, Brunei and Malaysia. In the United States, where the practice started and is most common, Rigs-to-Reefs is a nationwide program developed by the former Minerals Management Service (MMS), now Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The program has been generally popular with fishermen, the oil industry, and government regulators in the Gulf of Mexico, where offshore platforms develop into coral reefs, and as of September 2012, 420 former oil platforms, about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms, have been converted to permanent reefs. Opposition in California has prevented a rigs-to-reefs program on the West Coast of the US. Similarly, environmental opposition has prevented implementation of Rigs-to-Reefs in the North Sea. Inevitably, marine organisms attach themselves to the underwater portions of oil production platforms, transforming them into artificial reefs. These platforms continue to function as long as the reservoirs underneath them provide oil at a profitable rate. At the end of their productive lives they must be decommissioned and removed (in the US within one year). An alternative to removal is to turn the rig into a reef through the Rigs-to-Reef (RTR) program. All coastal states in the US have such artificial reef programs in the interest of increasing ocean fisheries but not all participate in RTR. The rig's steel structures are stable and durable. They create shelter for marine life in open waters where there was none. Note that production platforms are often called \"rigs\"; that terminology is used occasionally in this article—and indeed in the term Rigs-to-Reefs. However, within the industry \"rigs\" refers to apparatus with a derrick that can drill and service wells. (Most production platforms do not have such equipment installed.) Once a rig stops producing at economic rates, the site is usually abandoned. In the United States, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) requires the operator to remove the rig within a year of abandonment (stopped production) and lease end. MMS supports and encourages RTR as an alternative to total removal. RTR recognizes that during a rig's productive years, significant marine life comes to live on and around its structure. RTR preserves much of that marine life and encourages further growth. The operator benefits by avoiding the substantial cost of removal. Cumulative costs of removal had reached an estimated $1 billion by the year 2000. The shape and complexity of the structure may lead to significant species diversity. Officially, decommissioning an oil rig is the act of removal according to regulatory requirements and includes flushing, plugging and cementing wells to make them safe. Decommissioning is complicated by factors such as cost, safety, operational duration, environmental issues, risk, experience, and historical relationship between operator and state. As part of decommissioning, the operator must deal with the shell mound that collects on the bottom surrounding the rig. The mound forms on the pile of cuttings discharged from the original drilling operations, shells that have fallen from the platform's underwater structure, and material that has fallen and/or leaked from the platform, occasionally mixed with well seepage. Mounds can contain significant levels of toxic metals including, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, PCBs, lead, zinc, and poly-nuclear hydrocarbons. Removing the rig structure does not eliminate the need to address the mound. The method of decommissioning depends on water depth and structure type and is a three-step process that includes planning, permitting, and implementation. A party other than the operator usually administers the process. In Louisiana, costs as well as the risk involved are the primary factors in determining how to decommission rigs. If the savings are large enough, the operator typically chooses reefing and donates 1/2 the savings to maintain the reef. Decommissioning a shallow water rig typically costs $10–15 million so the amounts can be substantial. The Louisiana Artificial Reef program from its inception through 1998 received roughly $9.7 million in donations and has not taken taxpayer money. Severing the rig from the bottom using explosives is the easiest approach, but has the potential to harm marine life. This potential is greatly reduced if the explosives are all placed deep below the seafloor. Current requirements place the explosives a minimum of below the seafloor which eliminates the threat to all but the closest sea turtles. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) marine observers and helicopter surveys hours preceding the event keep most sea turtles away from the area. Alternatively, commercial divers can use mechanical and abrasive cutters, which preserves marine life, but places the divers at considerable risk. Reefing involves one of three methods.:  Offshore drilling began in California in the late 1800s from piers built out over the ocean. The first offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico was built in 1947 off the Louisiana coast. The United States began extracting oil offshore in the early 20th Century; \"Today over 4,500 offshore oil and gas platforms have been installed supplying 25% of the United States' production of natural gas and 10% of its oil.\" However, the concern over abandoned oil rigs surfaced only in the 1980s. The US Congress passed the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) in 1953, to control leasing of exploration rights in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The OCSLA did not contain any real environmental provisions associated with drilling and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill triggered the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which required that every major federal action (i.e.: oil exploration on the OCS) required an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In 1982, The U.S. Department of the Interior created the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to monitor development on the Outer Continental Shelf. The MMS leases submerged federal lands and assesses the environmental effects of exploration and drilling (by issuing an EIS). In 1984 Congress passed the National Fishing Enhancement Act (NFEA) which provided the basis for artificial reef programs. The NFEA spawned the National Artificial Reef Plan of 1985. This plan cleared the way for government-endorsed artificial reef projects and subsequently the Minerals Management Services' Rigs-to-Reef program. Following a number of hurricanes from 2004 to 2008, including Katrina, Ike, Ivan, and Rita, that damaged oil production platforms, offshore oil operators filed numerous applications to abandon unused platforms in place. The federal government responded by placing a moratorium on Rigs-to-Reefs, and requiring unused platforms to be speedily decommissioned by removal. In June 2013, the BSEE lifted its moratorium on Rigs-to-Reefs, subject to Coast Guard determination that the structure would not pose a threat to navigation, and acceptance of ownership and liability by the state government. If the Rigs-to-Reefs option is expected to be less expensive than removal, the platform owner pays half the estimated savings to the state agency receiving the former platform. The more than 4,500 oil production platforms in the US portion of the Gulf of Mexico are the largest concentration of offshore platforms in the world, having more offshore platforms than the rest of the world combined. The oil production platforms in the Gulf have also been called the largest artificial reef complex in the world. In 1979, Exxon relocated their experimental subsea production system from offshore Louisiana to a permitted artificial reef site off Apalachicola, Florida. The first platform jacket was donated by Tenneco and towed from Louisiana to Pensacola, Florida. By 2000, 151 platforms had been converted to permanent reefs. Of these, 90 were towed to new locations and 61 were abandoned in place. Louisiana had 94 of the platforms-turned reefs, Texas 50, Alabama 4, and Florida 3. Florida, which has a long-standing ban on offshore oil production, has requested and received a number of decommissioned oil platforms for creation of artificial reefs in Florida state waters. In contrast to the Gulf of Mexico states, old oil platforms have not been converted to artificial reefs in offshore California, the only other offshore oil-producing area in the contiguous 48 states. A number of reasons have been cited for this, primarily the strength of the environmental movement in California, its antagonistic relationship with the oil industry, and its reluctance to support any measure that would financially benefit the offshore oil industry. Other differences include the smaller number of offshore platforms (27 off California, versus approximately 4,500 in the Gulf of Mexico), and the smaller portion of the California economy made up by oil and fishing. The California legislature passed a bill allowing conditional partial removal of oil platforms in 2010, and the measure was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. A.B. 2503 “allows a platform owner or operator to design a ‘partial removal’ plan for a platform and to apply for permission to implement it”. The plan requires the approval of three agencies: The Department of Fish and Game (DFG), The Department of Ocean Protection Council (OPC), and the California State Lands Commission. As of 2013, no oil platforms have been converted to permanent reefs. Brunei has had a rigs-to-reefs policy since 1988. Offshore operator Shell Brunei Petroleum has towed numerous old platforms and jackets to two designated artificial reef areas located away from shipping lanes. The Baram-8 platform was damaged in a storm and collapsed to the seabed in 1975. It was made into an artificial reef. As of 2013, Malaysia has no rigs-to-reefs program, but was studying the Baram-8 reef as an example. In 2017, Dana and D30 Platform was laid out for rigs-to-reef in offshore Sarawak. Studies have concluded that oil platforms in the North Sea attract fish, and that a rigs-to-reefs policy there would benefit fishermen. However, the highly publicized occupation of the Brent Spar North Sea oil platform by Greenpeace in 1995 has been highly influential in Europe. Despite scientific findings of the potential value of rigs-to-reefs in the North Sea, the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR), which has jurisdiction over North Sea oil development, has blocked rigs-to-reefs. Opposition to, and also support for, Rigs-to-Reefs comes from environmentalists, fisherman, oil companies, and others. California and the North Sea are each debating RTR. In California, legislation was proposed during the 2010 session to clear legal hurdles for RTR; the Coastal Commission held hearings, but then the legislation was tabled. Even with the RTR successes in the Gulf of Mexico and Philippines, differences in terrain, government entities, and concerned citizens generated conflict. Some point out that the title “Rigs to Reefs” is somewhat of a misnomer. As Milton Love, a biologist with the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute noted, the oil production platforms are not just potential artificial reefs: \"They are in fact artificial reefs right now.\" The question to Rigs-to-Reef supporters is whether it is good public policy to remove established artificial reefs. A 2000 MMS report lists research that shows fish densities 20 to 50 times higher around oil and gas platforms than in nearby open water. Divers assess fish populations surrounding platforms. The report encourages recreational fisherman, divers and others who benefit from the increased density. Opponents claim that the greater density comes from an influx of nearby fish rather than increased total population. Research on rockfish populations on oil rigs offshore California supports both theories. The high fish populations make both active and inactive oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California popular destinations for sport fishermen and the charter fishing industry. The diversity of aquatic life on and near the platforms attracts recreational divers. These groups tend to support Rigs-to-Reefs, and fear the loss of coral and fish habitat if the oil platforms are removed. Commercial fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico is seen as highly dependent on oil platform habitat, which provides a hard substrate for aquatic life that is otherwise scarce in much of the Gulf. Dr. Bob Shipp, chairman of the University of South Alabama Department of Marine Sciences, and director of the Alabama Center for Estuarine Studies, would like to see 100 percent participation in Rigs-to-Reefs, and said of removing unused oil rigs from the Gulf: “As a fisheries scientist, I think it’s a very big mistake,” He elaborated: Those commercial fisherman who trawl generally oppose Rigs-to-Reefs because their nets may snag a rig, creating a hazardous situation. This is particularly the case in offshore California with bottom trawling commercial fishermen, who can foul their nets on the shell mounds that build up on the sea floor near the rig. Several fisherman have reported tangling their nets on submerged rigs. Navigational mishaps and diving accidents may also occur around an artificial reef. Gulf of Mexico Rigs-to-Reefs participants have not yet reported any liability problems. Rigs-to-Reefs was first explored in 1979 when the first oil rig was transported from Louisiana to a Florida site. This rig was the first of 5 Rigs-to-Reefs towed to Florida's coast. Louisiana was the first state to develop a program that allowed transfer of liability and ownership from the operator to the state. Texas later followed this example. Rigs-to-Reef is now the core of both Louisiana and Texas' artificial reef programs. Under the original guidelines, the Minerals Management Service would not release an operator from liability unless another entity accepts ongoing liability for the rig. If the reef is in state waters, the state typically accepts liability. In federal waters, liability typically goes to a private entity or to another MMS-approved agency. Critics claim that the primary reason that operators support RTR is their desire to offload decommissioning costs and liability. In 2001, the California legislature passed, although the governor then vetoed, a bill that would allow operators to transfer liability to another entity, while retaining liability for any pollution from the underlying well. Under the new policy issued June 2013, oil platforms in the Rigs-to-Reefs program must be deeded, and liability accepted by, the state government. As with cap-and-trade and ecotourism, RTR attempts to enlist the private sector in helping the environment. To many environmentalists, any program which benefits the oil industry, by lower decommissioning costs, is suspect. Some charge that rigs-to-reefs is an excuse for ocean dumping. Environmental groups have long opposed oil companies and frame their critique around distrust of the industry, particularly with regard to Rigs-to-Reefs in offshore California. \"No other industry is allowed to leave a toxic mess for the state to manage and maintain at taxpayer expense\" said Linda Krop, Chief council for the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center. The Environmental Defense Fund supports Rigs-to-Reefs in the Gulf of Mexico, as a way to preserve the existing reef habitat of the oil platforms."]}

In 2010, Shanghai port overtook the Port of Singapore to become the world's busiest container port. Shanghai's port handled 29.05 million TEUs, whereas Singapore's was a half million TEU's behind. In 2016, Shanghai port set a historic record by handling over 37 million TEUs. The Port of Shanghai faces the East China Sea to the east, and Hangzhou Bay to the south. It includes the confluences of the Yangtze River, Huangpu River (which enters the Yangtze River), and Qiantang River. The Port of Shanghai is managed by Shanghai International Port which superseded the Shanghai Port Authority in 2003. Shanghai International Port Company Limited is a public listed company, of which the Shanghai Municipal Government owns 44.23 percent of the outstanding shares. During the Ming dynasty, what is now the city of Shanghai was a part of Jiangsu Province (with a small part in Zhejiang Province). While Shanghai had become a county seat in the Yuan dynasty, it remained relatively a small town. Its location at the mouth of the Yangtze River led to its development as coastal trade developed during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor in the Qing dynasty. Gradually, the port of Shanghai surpassed the port of Ningbo and the port of Guangzhou to become the largest port of China at the time. In 1842, Shanghai became a treaty port, thus developing into an international commercial city. By the early 20th century, it was the largest city and the largest port in East Asia. In 1949, with the Communist takeover in Shanghai, overseas trade was cut dramatically. The economic policy of the People's Republic had a crippling effect on Shanghai's infrastructure and capital development. In 1991, the central government allowed Shanghai to initiate economic reform. Since then, the port of Shanghai has developed at an increasing pace. By 2005, the Yangshan deep water port was built on the Yangshan islands, a group of islands in Hangzhou Bay, linked to Shanghai by the Donghai Bridge. This development allowed the port to overcome shallow water conditions in its current location, and to rival another deep-water port, the nearby Ningbo-Zhoushan port. The port of Shanghai includes 3 major working zones: The Port of Shanghai is a critically important transport hub for the Yangtze River region and the most important gateway for foreign trade. It serves the Yangtze economically developed hinterland of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan provinces with its dense population, strong industrial base and developed agricultural sector.", "Wuhu\nWuhu Wuhu (; literally \"Weedy Lake\") is a prefecture-level city in southeastern Anhui province, China. Sitting on the southeast bank of the Yangtze River, Wuhu borders Xuancheng to the southeast, Chizhou and Tongling to the southwest, Hefei city to the northwest, Ma'anshan city to the northeast, Jiangsu Province to the east, and is approximately southwest of Nanjing. As of 2017, the city had a population of approximately 3,696,000 officially registered inhabitants. The prefecture-level city of Wuhu administers 8 county-level divisions, including 4 districts and 4 counties. By the end of 2017, the total population was estimated to be 3,842,100，of whom 1,665,000 live in the 4 urban districts and the others live in the counties. The city has over 47 ethnic minorities present — the largest being the Muslim population. There are other ethnic minorities with over 500 inhabitants in the city: Yi, Tujia, Miao, Zhuang, and Manchu. Jiang-Huai Mandarin, a branch of Mandarin Chinese, was widely spoken in urban area, while some people in the counties spoke Wu Chinese. \"Putonghua\", or Standard Mandarin was commonly used in this area. Wuhu is known to have been inhabited since at least 770 BCE. It became a strategically important town during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 AD), when it was controlled by the Eastern Wu. At this time it was known as Jiuzi (Chiu-tzu ). Under the Ming dynasty, Wuhu developed into a major commercial center and river port and since that time has been known as a center of the rice trade. In 1644, the Hongguang Emperor (better known as the Prince of Fu), one of the last emperors of the Ming Dynasty, was captured by forces of the new Qing Dynasty in Wuhu. During the Taiping Rebellion, Wuhu exchanges hands over five times between Taiping and Imperial forces. The city became a treaty port in 1876 and has remained a commercial center since that time. The city's Roman Catholic cathedral, St. Joseph's Cathedral (), dates from this time. Most of the downtown area alongside the Yangtze River was ceded in the British concession. Trade in rice, wood, and tea flourished at Wuhu until the Warlord Era of the 1920s and 1930s, when bandits were active in the area. At the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, part of the Second World War, Wuhu was occupied by Japan on December 10, 1937. This was a prelude to the Battle of Nanjing, ending in the Nanjing Massacre. Under Japanese occupation, Chinese resistance fighters hid in the lakes around Wuhu by submerging themselves and breathing through reeds. Major industries began to be developed in Wuhu after the Second World War, with the development of the textile industry, shipbuilding, and paper mills. Despite this, Wuhu had been lagging behind Ma'anshan and Tongling in industrial production for decades after the establishment of the People's Republic of China and remained primarily a commercial center for trade in rice, silk, cotton, tea, wheat and eggs. However, with recent years' economic rise, Wuhu has become a hub for manufacturing. In July 2016, Nanling and Wuwei counties suffered serious damage from heavy rain. The city is the second largest economy in Anhui, after Hefei, the provincial capital. In 2017, Wuhu’s GDP reached RMB 306.552 billion. Its per capita GDP was RMB 83880 (~$12426). Wuhu Economic & Technological Development Area in the north of the city launched in 1993 is one of the first state-level economic and technological development area in Anhui province. It has the only export processing zone in the province. Chery Automobile and Anhui Conch Cement Company are headquartered in this development area. Wuhu is the fifth largest port alongside Yangtze River. Yuxikou Pier is the largest inland river coal harbor in China. Buses in Wuhu start at ¥1 for a general bus and ¥2 for air-conditioned buses. During the day, taxis start at ¥7; after 2.5 km, the price increases at ¥1.8 per km. From 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. taxis start at ¥8 and after 2.5 km, the prices increase at a rate of ¥2.5 for each additional km. There is a free 4 minutes of waiting time due to traffic/red lights. Afterwards it's an additional ¥0.34 for every minute during the day and ¥0.38 for every minute at night. There is no civilian airport in Wuhu but there is a military airport used by the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Wuhu has one Yangtze River crossing—the Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge, opened in 2000, carries the G5011 Wuhu–Hefei Expressway and Huainan Railway. Wuhu is served by the Anhui–Jiangxi, Nanjing–Tongling and Huainan Railways. It only takes 2.5 hours from Shanghai to Wuhu by high-speed train. Wuhu Rail Transit Line 1 and Line 2 are under construction and scheduled to be operational by the end of 2019. The great poet Li Bai spent his late life in Wuhu, it is said, due to its striking landscape. Li Bai was born in a Central Asian town and raised in the southwestern China. Xie Tiao, one of the most distinctive Six Dynasty poets whom he greatly admired, left many poems when holding positions here. In the Tang dynasty (619-907), the poet Du Mu wrote a famous poem \"Thoughts on Staying Again at Wuhu\". A factory in Wuhu carries on the local craft of making wrought iron pictures. Other local handicrafts are embossed lacquerware and rice straw pith patchwork. A famous stone tablet in Wuhu recording local events of the Song dynasty period (ca. 1000 AD) is considered to be a masterpiece of the renowned calligrapher Mi Fu. In the Western world, Wuhu is now known as the home city to many adopted Chinese children. An itinerant blacksmith named Tang Tianchi is reputed to have invented the wrought-iron picture in Wuhu, when a painter whom he admired chided him, \"You will never make pictures by beating iron.\" Another blacksmith of the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC) named Gan Jiang was famous for sword making. Zhe Shan (Reddish Brown Hill) is said to get its colour from the flames of Gan Jiang's furnace. Shen Shan (Sacred Hill) is the legendary location of his sword grinding rock and tempering pool. Wuhu and Anqing are noted centers of the Yanjiang cuisine. It specializes in freshwater fish and poultry, and features special techniques of chopping, shaping, and colouring. The flavour of Yanjiang dishes is often enhanced by sweetening and smoking.", "Wushi Harbor\nWushi Harbor The Wushi Harbor () is a harbor in Toucheng Township, Yilan County, Taiwan.

Since 2002 the institute's journal \"Rechtsgeschichte\" appears annually in print (Klostermann Verlag) and is simultaneously available through open access since 2012. Its predecessors were IUS COMMUNE, journal for European legal history (1967-2001), and the Rechtshistorisches Journal (journal on legal history, 1982-2001). Research results of the institute are also published as working papers, pre-print editions or in a post-print format in the Legal History Research Paper Series, which has appeared online as SSRN since 2012. Beyond the journals, a number of book series reflect the work at the institute, i.e. \"Global Perspectives on Legal History\", \"Studien zur europäischen Rechtsgeschichte\", \"Studien zu Policey und Policeywissenschaft\" or \"methodica - Einführung in die rechtshistorische Forschung\".

It is one of the research institutes of the Max Planck Society. The Institute was founded in 1980. It evolved from a project group for international and comparative social law, launched by the Max Planck Society in 1976. Its founding director was Professor Hans F. Zacher. During its early years, the Institute mainly focused on research on the methodology of comparing social laws. Several studies on the social law systems of other states laid the foundations for comparative social law as a subject of research. Current research focuses on social security law in terms of collectively organized social benefits and services provided by the civil polity (cash benefits, benefits in kind and personal services), on fundamental social rights, and on social constitutional law in selected countries. Comparative law research bears various links to other legal disciplines, most notably private law, commercial law, family law, labour law and fiscal law. The Institute also focuses on the field of intergovernmental and international social law, with the chief emphasis placed on bilateral and multilateral social security agreements, above all on developments in supranational European social law."]}
{"query": "War of 1812 causes and global impact instead of military campaigns", "pos": ["Opposition to the War of 1812 in Britain\nOpposition to the War of 1812 in Britain The War of 1812 was unpopular in Britain even before the war began. The public was not in favor of the war due to economic and moral reasons, but the government continued the war as part of their larger battle in Europe. As the economy continued to suffer, the opposition continued to grow, and as Britain's wars continued, many in Britain began to disdain the idea of another war. The burning of the White House also caused backlash to the War of 1812.  The first public opposition to the War of 1812 came in 1807, when the British attacked the USS \"Chesapeake\", which many thought would lead to war. The loudest opposition came from \"The Morning Chronicle\", a popular newspaper of the time. The paper published anonymous letters, signed A.B., warning that war with America would set the young nation on the path to becoming self-reliant for its manufacturing, thus harming British manufacturers. Most of the opposition to the war was based on economic grounds. America was not only a major consumer of British manufacturing, but it was also a major supplier of raw materials, such as wood and cotton. For example, the U.S. alone made up more than half the cotton imports to Britain in the years leading up to the War of 1812.  British opposition coalesced around the Orders in Council. Part of the larger maritime war with France, the Orders were intended to choke off French trade with the rest of world. The policy especially affected the neutral United States, which claimed it should be able to trade with both nations, since it was a neutral party in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. While many in Britain saw the opposition to impressment as nothing more than whining, more sectors sympathized with America’s plight due to the Orders in Council. Almost every British industry was affected by the policy, as America was a large supplier and consumer for the British economy. Sectors like textiles and manufacturing continued to suffer, while industries like finance were also dealt a serious blow. Cities like Liverpool, which heavily relied upon American shipping, felt the loss of the trading partner in their economies. Some publications, such as the \"Glasgow Journal\", accused the British Parliament of keeping the orders in place so that they could make money from selling exemptions to the rule. By the spring of 1812, Parliament had seen the toll the orders took on the economy and decided to suspend them. Much of the opposition to the War of 1812 came from general opposition to war in Britain during the time. Britain had been at war with France since 1793, with only a brief peace in 1802, and the Napoleonic Wars seemed to have no end. By 1812, defense spending, as a percentage of GDP, was almost 25%. The effects of war hit the British public as well. The nation had become the most militarized in the world, with 20% of all males ending up in the military, leading Britain to have a substantially higher rate of mobilization than even its rival, France. The death rate among those in the military also rose dramatically, further angering the British public.  For those not in the military, the war affected the pocketbook. By 1812, almost 35% of income went to taxes, a rate much higher than the tax rates in pervious wars. Given all of this, many in Britain were angered about the start of another war, which some, like William Cobbet of the \"Weekly Register\", argued was just another way for those who profited off war to continue to make money. Movements, such as the Friends of Peace, sprung up to oppose the war with France and the war with America. The last major point of opposition against the War of 1812 came when the British burned the White House, along with other public buildings in Washington, D.C, in August of 1814. Many argued that America deserved to be treated with the same wartime respect that the European powers received, especially when a battle did not involve Native Americans or American militia forces. Other feared it might weaken Britain’s position at the Congress of Vienna. For Britain, many viewed the burning as a moral failure, since the White House was not a fort or a battle encampment. The continued outrage contributed to Parliament’s decision to expedite peace negotiations, which resulted in the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814.", "War of 1812 Museum (Plattsburgh)\nWar of 1812 Museum (Plattsburgh) The War of 1812 museum is a museum in Plattsburgh, New York dedicated to exploring the causes and effects of the War of 1812 and the Battle of Plattsburgh.

The General Society was founded on January 9, 1854, at the Congress Hall in Philadelphia by Joel B. Sutherland. Any male person above the age of eighteen (18) years who is a lineal descendant of one who served during the War of 1812, in the army, navy, revenue-marine, or privateer service of the United States, offering proof thereof satisfactory to the State Society to which he may, make application for membership, and who is of good moral character and reputation, may become a member of the Society when approved of by said State Society, under such regulations as it may make for passing upon applications for membership. Female persons above the age of 18 who qualify, may apply to the United States Daughters of 1812. On January 9, 1854 (a day after the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans), a group of over 1,500 War of 1812 veterans from across the United States met in convention at the Congress Hall in Philadelphia, having responded to a call issued by Joel B. Sutherland (1792-1861), a War of 1812 veteran and former Congressman from Philadelphia. Ostensibly called to draft resolutions pertaining to bounty land benefit legislation, the veterans assembled in Philadelphia acknowledged the need for an organization for mutual support and to perpetuate the history of the War of 1812. From this convention, the Society of the War of 1812 was founded and Sutherland was elected its first President. The Society met again in convention a year later in Washington, D.C., where they were received by President Franklin Pierce at the White House and lobbied members of Congress to secure the bounty land legislation, which was passed later in 1855. Sutherland’s goal was to form a division of the Society of the War of 1812 in each state in the union. His vision for the organization was not completed at the time of his death in 1861.

As World War I was one of the first true global conflicts, it was shaped by the influence of multiple nations and each country's unique problems. Other factors helped shape the war and changed the course of fighting. With the rise of imperialism and a desire for resources, the war involved almost all European nations, and was therefore fought on several fronts. Geographic barriers created diversions and weather patterns helped in leading the Allies to victory. Also, the new spread of technology along with trench warfare and disease eventually led to the defeat of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Imperialism before World War I had been on the rise since the mid-nineteenth century because industrialization had caused a growing need for natural resources. Regions like Africa and India had been settled by European countries in order to make profit and extend power. Tensions began to rise as nations formed alliances with one another to improve their strength. Due to geographical closeness, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy came together as the Triple Alliance and later became the Central powers due to their central positioning in Europe. France and Britain became allies along with Russia in order to defend their borders and support each other in case of war. Conflicts in the Balkans grew steadily, and after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, alliances drew almost all European nations and colonies into what would become known as World War I. Due to the geographical positioning of the Triple Entente, the Central Powers were faced on all sides by their enemies. Once Italy had joined in on the side of the Allies, the war became a three front war. The big Western front was in France, and Italian Front in the mountains of Italy, and the Eastern Front was on the border of Russia. Because Germany and Austria-Hungary had to split their armies, they were severely weakened. While the Schlieffen Plan intended for Germany to send ninety percent of their army to France and quickly overtake it then move to Russia, they were held up by fierce fighting at the First Battle of the Marne. Throughout major battles in the war, geography influenced the method of fighting and often the victor. At Ypres, many men died by drowning in thick, liquid mud and fighting conditions were awful The Gallipoli Campaign involved the death of many Australian Allied soldiers because of the positioning of the peninsula. The Ottoman soldiers were able to position themselves at the top of a hill while all of the Allied soldiers remained at the bottom. In order to defeat the Central Powers, they had to get to the top of the hill without getting shot. Very few men ever made it up the hill, and if they did, they were shot shortly after. The Gallipoli Campaign was a defeating loss of the Allies. Fighting on the Italian Front involved the Swiss Alps and other mountains. Rivers, such as the Isonzo were fought over, to gain access to supplies and resources. The domination of seas was important because naval fighting was also a true sign of power. The vastness of Russia made it difficult for the Germans to reach, and once they dropped out of the war their front was simply used to catch the Central Powers on both sides. Brutal winters diminished supplies and left both sides cold, starving, and wet. Lack of shoes and good clothes caused vulnerability and the spread of disease. Rain, snow, heat, and cold all played their role in World War One because of the giant amount of areas the war was fought in. The Atlantic Ocean was home to submarines, naval ships, and also the transfer of goods. Domination on the seas was necessary for getting supplies, people, and weapons from place to place. With new technology, ideas were able to spread quickly and new warfare was created by both sides such as poison gas. Communication also played a role in getting the United States to join the war. The interception of the Zimmermann Telegraph as well as the sinking of the Lusitania both helped persuade the U.S.A. in joining the war. Trench Warfare was common during WWI, although it was not exactly the healthiest or morale-boosting experience for soldiers living in the trenches. They were constantly wet and water would often build up to several inches. Urine, body odor, poison gas, bad food, rats, little clothing, and misery all defined the trench lifestyle. Diseases such as Trench Foot emerged and close quarters caused infection to be passed from one person to another and from rats and bugs to humans as well. Loud bombs could often cause deafness and long periods in the trench often led to mental illness as well. The geography of World War One helped it to play out the way it did. The brutal conditions, geographic landmarks, and outbreaks of disease as well as location helped in bringing the defeat of the Central Powers. After the war at the Treaty of Versailles, Austria-Hungary was broken up into two separate countries, and much of the German landspace was given away to France, Poland, and others. This angered Germany and set up tensions for another war of the worlds."]}
{"query": "Bale province current regions and geography instead of its historical creation in 1960", "pos": ["Bale Province, Ethiopia\nBale Province, Ethiopia Bale (also known as Bali) is the name of two former polities located in the southeastern part of modern Ethiopia. The earlier Bale was a Muslim tributary kingdom to the Emperor of Ethiopia during the Solomonic dynasty, located between Ifat and Hadiya. Taddesse Tamrat locates Bale south of the Shebelle River, which separated the kingdom from Dawaro to the north and Adal to the northeast; Richard Pankhurst adds that its southern boundary was the Ganale Dorya River. Ulrich Braukämper, after discussing the evidence, states that this former dependency \"occupied an area in the northeast of the province which later was named after it, between the mountain range of Urgoma and the eastern Wabi Bend.\" This kingdom's earliest surviving mention is in the Soldiers Songs of Emperor Amda Seyon I. The historian Chihab al-Umari described its size as 20 days travel by six days travel, and its lands were more fertile and with a better climate than its Muslim neighbors. It had an army of 18,000 horsemen and \"many\" foot soldiers. While the Muslim Kingdom of Bale was the first territory under the Ethiopian Emperor Imam that Ahmad Gragn conquered after the Battle of Shimbra Kure, Emperor Geladewos quickly reconquered it after the Imam's death. However, the territory eventually became the possession of the Oromo people, who had begun settling there as early as the Mudana gadaa (1530-1538). Ethiopian efforts to reconquer Bale ended when Fasil, brother of Emperor Sarsa Dengel, was killed with all of his people by the Dawe Oromo. Following a failed rebellion against his brother in 1567, Fasil had fled there apparently believing that the southern boundaries would serve him as a power base. Sarsa Dengel, during his successful campaign against the ruler of Harar, advanced as far as the Shabelle, but the Oromo had meanwhile migrated further north into the Amhara ruled empire behind his back. Although the \"Royal chronicle\" of Emperor Susenyos reports that Dagano, the governor of Bale had paid tribute to Emperor Yaqob, Braukämper concludes that \"from the entirety of the historical situation that Ethiopia's claim to sovereignty later in the seventeenth century was purely theoretical.\" The later Bale, named for the earlier one, was a province in the south-eastern part of Ethiopia, with its capital city at Bale Robe. It was created in 1960 out of the province of Harerge south of the Shebelle. The lowlands of both Bale and Harerge encompassed Ethiopia's portion of the Ogaden. Beginning in 1963, Waqo Gutu led a rebellion which at one point involved all of Bale. The Ethiopian military was not able to put it down until 1969. Waqo Gutu did not offer his surrender until February of the following year, and afterward was granted a commission in the Ethiopian Army.

{"query": "Doctor Mabuse character origin and literary analysis instead of film adaptations.", "pos": ["Doctor Mabuse\nDoctor Mabuse Doctor Mabuse is a fictional character created by Norbert Jacques in the novel \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" and made famous by the three movies director Fritz Lang made about the character; see \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\". Although the character was designed deliberately to mimic villains such as Dr. Fu Manchu, Doctor Nikola, Fantômas, or Svengali, the latter of which was a direct inspiration, Jacques' goals were commercial success and to make political comments, in much the same way that the silent movie \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920) had done just a few years previously. Dr. Mabuse is a master of disguise and telepathic hypnosis known to employ body transference, most often through demonic possession but sometimes utilizing object technologies such as television or phonograph machines, to build a \"society of crime\". Mabuse rarely commits his crimes in person, instead operating primarily through a network of agents enacting his schemes. Mabuse's agents range from career criminals working for him, to innocents blackmailed or hypnotized into cooperation, to dupes manipulated so successfully that they do not realize that they are doing exactly what Mabuse planned for them to do. Mabuse's identity often changes; one \"Dr. Mabuse\" may be defeated and sent to an asylum, jail or the grave, only for a new \"Dr. Mabuse\" to later appear, as depicted in \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\". The replacement invariably has the same methods, the same powers of hypnosis and the same criminal genius. There are even suggestions in some instalments of the series, that the \"real\" Mabuse is some sort of spirit that possesses a series of hosts. He first appeared in the 1921 novel \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" (\"Dr. Mabuse The Gambler\") by Norbert Jacques. The novel benefitted from unprecedented publicity and quickly became a best-seller. Lang, already an accomplished director, worked with his wife Thea von Harbou on a revision of the novel to bring it to the screen, where it also became a great success. The film \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" (1922), with a playing time of more than four hours, was released in two sections: \"The Great Gambler: An Image of the Time\" and \"Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age.\" After the great successes of the novel and the movie, it was almost a decade before anything more was done with the character. Jacques had been working on a sequel to the novel, named \"Mabuse's Colony\", in which Mabuse has died and a group of his devotees are starting an island colony, based on the principles described by Mabuse's manifesto. However, the novel was unfinished. After conversations with Lang and von Harbou, Jacques agreed to discontinue the novel and the sequel instead became the 1933 movie \"Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse\", in which the Mabuse of 1920 (still played by Rudolf Klein-Rogge) is an inmate in an insane asylum but has for some time been obsessively writing meticulous plans for crime and terrorism—plans that are being performed by a gang of criminals outside the asylum, who receive their orders from a person who has identified himself to them only as Dr. Mabuse.", "Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\nDr. Mabuse the Gambler Dr. Mabuse the Gambler () is the first film in the Dr. Mabuse series about the character Doctor Mabuse who featured in the novels of Norbert Jacques. It was directed by Fritz Lang and released in 1922. The film is silent and would be followed by the sound sequels \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" (1933) and \"The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse\" (1960). It is four and a half hours long and divided into two parts, originally released a month apart: \"Der große Spieler: Ein Bild der Zeit\" and \"Inferno: Ein Spiel von Menschen unserer Zeit\". The title, \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\", makes use of three meanings of the German \"Der Spieler\" which can mean \"gambler\", \"puppeteer\", or \"actor\". The character Dr. Mabuse, who disguises himself, manipulates people, and is a notorious gambler, embodies all senses of the word. Therefore, \"the Player\" might be a more appropriate translation of the title. The film is included in the book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", being the first of five Lang films to be entered. Part I — The Great Gambler: A Picture of the Time (\"Part I - Der große Spieler: Ein Bild der Zeit\") Dr. Mabuse is a criminal mastermind, doctor of psychology, and master of disguise, armed with the powers of hypnosis and mind control, who oversees the counterfeiting and gambling rackets of the Berlin underworld. He visits gambling dens by night under various guises and aliases, using the power of suggestion to win at cards and finance his plans. Among his many henchmen are: Spoerri, his cocaine-addicted manservant; Georg, his chauffeur and sometime assassin; Pesch, an inept goon; Hawasch, who employs a gang of blind men in a counterfeiting operation; Fine, a woman who serves as a lookout; and Folies Bergère dancer Cara Carozza, who loves him. As the film opens, Mabuse orchestrates the theft of a commercial contract in order to create a temporary panic in the stock market, which he exploits to make huge profits. Edgar Hull, the son of a millionaire industrialist, becomes Mabuse's next victim. As \"Hugo Balling\", Mabuse gains access to Hull's gentlemen's club and wins a small fortune at cards from the hypnotized Hull, who is made to play badly and recklessly. Afterwards, Hull is unable to account for his behavior. State prosecutor Norbert von Wenk takes an interest in Hull, believing he is the latest in a string of victims similarly tricked by the elusive \"Great Unknown\". Von Wenk goes undercover at a gambling den, where he encounters a disguised Dr. Mabuse. Mabuse attempts to hypnotize von Wenk, but he effectively resists. Mabuse flees. Von Wenk, quickly regaining his faculties, gives chase through the city, but the doctor escapes. Boarding a taxicab driven by Georg, von Wenk is gassed, robbed, and set adrift in a rowboat. Dr. Mabuse realizes that Hull is assisting the state prosecutor, and resolves to eliminate both men. Carozza, who has been romancing Hull on Mabuse's orders, lures the young man to a new illegal casino; when von Wenk calls in the police to raid the place, Carozza, Hull and a police bodyguard exit through the back door, where Georg awaits. He kills Hull, but Carozza is caught and jailed. Von Wenk questions her for information about the \"Great Unknown\", but she refuses to speak. Von Wenk enlists the aid of Countess Told (nicknamed the \"Passive Lady\"), an aristocrat bored by her dull husband and seeking thrills wherever she can find them, to try to get the information by trickery. The Countess is placed in the same cell, an apparent victim of another raid, but Carozza is not fooled. Carozza reveals only her great love for Mabuse, ensuring her silence. The Countess, moved by Carozza's passion, tells von Wenk that she cannot continue to assist him. Dr. Mabuse does nothing to extricate Carozza from jail. He instead attends a séance where he meets Countess Told, who (while under his hypnotic influence) invites him to her house. Once there, Mabuse, taken by the Countess's beauty, decides to display his power by telepathically inducing her husband, Count Told, to cheat at poker. His guests are outraged when they detect it, and the Countess faints. Dr. Mabuse uses the distraction to abduct her and imprison her in his lair. Part II — Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age (\"Part II - Inferno: Ein Spiel von Menschen unserer Zeit\") A sick and disgraced Count Told seeks the help of Dr. Mabuse to treat his depression; Mabuse uses this chance to isolate the Count in his manor and cut off any inquiries about the Countess's whereabouts. The Count's condition worsens, and he is tormented by hallucinations. Meanwhile, Carozza is moved to a women's prison and again interrogated by von Wenk. Fearing betrayal, Mabuse sanctions Carozza's death. Georg smuggles poison to her cell, which she takes out of loyalty. Another of Mabuse's henchmen, Pesch, bombs von Wenk's office while posing as an electrician, but von Wenk is unharmed and Pesch detained. Mabuse – again fearing betrayal – arranges for Pesch to be killed by a sniper while being transported in a police wagon. Intent on leaving town, Mabuse gives the captive Countess the choice of going with him voluntarily. Her refusal angers him, and Mabuse vows that he will kill the Count. Through his powers of suggestion, he induces the Count to commit suicide with a razor blade. When von Wenk investigates his death, he questions Dr. Mabuse as the Count's psychoanalyst. Dr. Mabuse speculates that the Count had fallen under the control of a hostile will, and asks von Wenk if he is familiar with the experiments of one \"Sandor Weltemann\", who will be performing a public demonstration of telepathy and mass hypnosis at a local theater. Von Wenk and his men attend Weltemann's show. Weltemann is none other than Mabuse in disguise, and his magic show provides him an opportunity to hypnotize von Wenk, who falls into a trance. Mabuse's secret command to von Wenk is to leave the auditorium, get in his car, and drive off a cliff, but von Wenk's men intercede just in time. Coming to his senses, von Wenk orders a siege of Mabuse's house. Dr. Mabuse and his men make a final stand. In the ensuing gunfight, Hawasch and Fine are killed, Spoerri and Georg are taken into custody, and the Countess is rescued. Dr. Mabuse flees through an underground sewer to Hawasch's counterfeiting workshop, where he becomes trapped, as the doors cannot be opened from the inside. There, Mabuse is confronted by the ghosts of his victims and various demonic illusions. Spoerri, under interrogation, identifies a key found at Mabuse's mansion as being for the workshop. Von Wenk and the police break in and take the now-insane Dr. Mabuse away.  Production of the first part of \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\" began while the novel on which it is based, Norbert Jacques' \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" was still being serialized. The film made a number of important changes from the book version. In the book the characters engage in constant soliloquies which would not have adapted well to film, particularly a silent film which would have required many intertitles to make that work. The film also eliminated a subplot in which Mabuse's actions are shown to be motivated by a desire to create his own country within South America. Film historian David Kalat points out that by eliminating reference to Mabuse's motivation Lang starts to dehumanize the character, which helped lead to the character becoming a franchise. But Kalat also notes that this eliminates the irony of the fact that Mabuse was seen by many viewers as a representation of aspects of Adolf Hitler, and many Nazis actually fled to South America after World War II. Lang and von Harbou also added some elements to the film that were not in the novel. One of Mabuse's key skills in the film is as a counterfeiter, but in the novel he never engaged in this. Mabuse's role in counterfeiting money adds to the social subtext and to the themes of the film. The film's opening, a 20-minute tour de force introducing the myth of Mabuse, was also not in the novel. The introduction starts with Mabuse shuffling a deck of photos like playing cards which will determine which disguise he will use that day and culminates with Mabuse manipulating a stock market crash. Kalat traces the inspiration for this sequence to Louis Feuillade's 1913 \"Fantômas II: Juve contre Fantômas (Juve vs. Fantômas)\". The ending to the second part of \"Dr. Mabuse\" is also unique to the film. The film incorporates a number of special effects such as animations and superimpositions. One aspect that was cheered upon the film's original release was the nighttime scene of the automobile chase in which Wenk chases Mabuse, which David Kalat called the most successful execution of such nighttime photography to that time. It was during the production of this film that Lang and von Harbou began their affair which would ultimately result in their marriage. Although von Harbou was married to Klein-Rogge at the time, their separation was amicable and did not create a problem for the film. A key theme of the film is the dissolution of German society after World War I. The film portrays but exaggerates the difficult conditions during the period making the film's world a dystopia. The worthless counterfeit money created by Mabuse reflects the nearly worthless Deutsche Mark during the hyperinflation resulting from the Weimar Republic printing excessive money to pay war reparations. The stock market swings, gambling parlors and miserable living conditions for poor people depicted in the film were also reflections of conditions in Germany at the time. The character of Dr. Mabuse can also be seen as depiction of \"the power of evil or a distorted inner psyche\". Lang scholar Paul Jensen interpreted Mabuse as \"a symbol to unite all the negative factors in Germany at the time\". The film depicts difficult problems such as rampant crime, worthless money and a volatile stock market as thus being under the control of a single man. Bernd Widdig points out that while \"Dr. Mabuse\" is not an anti-Semitic film, aspects of Mabuse's character may have reflected contemporary stereotypes of Jews, especially since he acts in stereotypically Jewish roles such as psychoanalyst, banker, peddler and revolutionary, and consistent with the views on Jews of some contemporary Germans his manipulations were responsible for problems in society. A contemporary Nazi critic wrote that Mabuse is \"a quintessential Jewish figure\" who goes through time with the singular goal of \"mastery of the world\" regardless of the consequences to others and whose descent into insanity caused his crimes to go unpunished in what the Nazi critic described as \"the typical case of the Jewish criminal\". On the other hand, Mabuse with his hypnotic power over the masses in pursuit of evil has also been seen as a foreshadowing of Adolf Hitler. In the sequel \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" the link between the Mabuse character and the Nazis is made stronger. Lang stated that he viewed Mabuse as a Nietzschean \"Übermensch\". Lang also saw Mabuse's character as emblematic of a certain kind of money-accumulator in Weimar Germany referred to as a \"Raffke\". The producer of \"Dr. Mabuse\", Erich Pommer, saw the film as a depiction of the contemporary conflict between the liberal conservatives and the Marxist Spartacists in which the Mabuse character represented the Spartacists. Another theme in the film is surveillance and seeing without being seen. Yet another theme is that of being versus seeming, portrayed through Mabuse's disguises and through buildings whose interiors seem inconsistent with their exteriors. \"Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung\" called the first part \"the attempt to create an image of our chaotic times\" in its April 30, 1922 issue. It went on to state that it \"will give people fifty or one hundred years from now an idea of an age that they could hardly comprehend without such a document.\" \"Film-Kurier\" praised Klein-Rogge's \"brilliant performance\" and Lang's \"sensitive yet experienced\" direction. When the film was released in the United States in 1927 in a single film that was less than half the length of the original 2-part version, \"The New York Times\" criticized it for being too long and for the \"hyperbolic overacting\". But when the full length version finally was released in the United States at the 1973 New York Film Festival, \"Times\" critic Nora Sayre praised it as being \"something very good\" and \"possibly the hit of the festival\". \"Variety\" praised the film's plot for its \"speed and life\" while acknowledging that it can be confusing. \"Variety\" felt the best parts of the movie were the scenes between Mabuse and Von Wenk. Variety praised several of the acting performances but felt Klein-Rogge was too small to be fully effective in the role, and praised some of Lang's technical effects while criticizing the overlong intertitles. \"Time Out\" criticized the film for its \"disorganised and erratically paced\" narrative and \"shaky\" grasp of social reality but praised its \"flashes of inspiration\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer Tim Purtell rated the film an A-, comparing the titular villain to those in the James Bond and \"Mission Impossible\" movies. Purtell particularly praised the \"sharp\" plot turns, \"stunning visuals\" and Klein-Rogge's performance.

Led by the enigmatic Kim Fahy, the Mabuses offer music which mixes pop sensibilities with more esoteric concerns such as film and literature. The name \"Mabuses\" is a tribute to the Fritz Lang film trilogy about a master criminal called Dr. Mabuse. Lyrically and musically, their recordings can be described as modern psychedelia.  \"The Mabuses is supremely idealistic pop, cut according to the belief that the form should entice, baffle and ruffle rather than provide a readily assimilable template. Fahy's rhythmic/melodic charge is rooted in folk-derived Brit-pop, the kind that typified 1967's psychedelic headcharge, a.k.a.

Later, she appears in other poetry and literature, and in various guises in drama and cinema. In the play, her activity is described in a famous speech by Mercutio written originally in prose and often adapted into iambic pentameter, in which she is described as a miniature creature who performs midnight pranks upon sleepers. Being driven by a team of atomies, she rides her chariot over their noses and \"delivers the fancies of sleeping men.\" She is also described as a midwife to help sleepers \"give birth\" to their dreams. She may be a figure borrowed from folklore, and though she is often associated with the Irish Medb in popular culture, and has been suggested by historian Thomas Keightley to be from \"Habundia\", a more likely origin for her name would be from Mabel and the Middle English derivative \"Mabily\" (as used by Chaucer) all from the Latin \"amabilis\" (\"lovable\"). \"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. <br> She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes <br> In shape no bigger than an agate-stone <br> On the fore-finger of an alderman, <br> Drawn with a team of little atomies <br> Athwart men's noses as they lies asleep; <br> Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br> The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, <br> The traces of the smallest spider's web, <br> The collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams, <br> Her whip of cricket's bone; the lash of film; <br> Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat, <br> Not half so big as a round little worm <br> Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid:<br> Her chariot is an empty hazelnut <br> Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br> Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers. <br> And in this state she gallops night by night <br> Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;<br> O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on court'sies straight,<br> O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees,<br> O’er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, <br> Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, <br> Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: <br> Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier's nose, <br> And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; <br> And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail <br> Tickling a parson's nose as a’ lies asleep, <br> Then dreams, he of another benefice: <br> Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier's neck,<br> And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, <br> Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, <br> Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon <br> Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br> And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two<br> And sleeps again.

In Poole's work \"Parnassus\", Mab is described as the Queen of the Fairies and consort to Oberon, Emperor of the Fairies. \"Queen Mab\" is a 1750 pantomime by actor Henry Woodward. \"Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem\" (1813) is the title of the first large poetic work written by the famous English Romantic poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822). Herman Melville's epic American novel \"Moby Dick\" (1851) includes a chapter called \"Queen Mab\". The 31st chapter of Melville's work is entitled such because it describes a dream by Captain Ahab's second mate, Stubb. In J. M. Barrie's \"The Little White Bird\" (1902) Queen Mab lives in Kensington Gardens and grants Peter Pan – who has learned he is a boy, and thus can no longer fly – his wish to fly again. American philosopher George Santayana wrote a short piece entitled \"Queen Mab\" which appeared in his 1922 book \"Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies\". This particular soliloquy considers English literature as an indirect form of self-expression in which the English writer \"will dream of what Queen Mab makes other people dream\" rather than revealing him or herself. In Jim Butcher's \"The Dresden Files\" series, Queen Mab of The Winter Court (also known as 'The Queen of Air and Darkness') is an important recurring character with mysterious motives. Ruler of the Unseelie Sidhe, Mab lives in a dark castle of ice located in the fey worlds of The Nevernever and is generally considered to be incredibly cruel, cold, and a maker of unbreakable pacts. Queen Mab is the queen of the Unseelie Court in Julie Kagawa's \"The Iron Fey\" series. Queen Mab is one of the three ancient Fae queens, sister to Maeve and Mora, in Sarah J. Maas's \"Throne of Glass\" series. Queen Mab is one of the primary villains in the late story arcs of the \"Hellboy\" comic book series. In Stephen and Owen King’s book \"Sleeping Beauties\", under the alias Evie Black, the main antagonist of the book suggests she is the one being addressed in the Queen Mab speech by Mercutio in \"Romeo and Juliet\". In Andrzej Sapkowski's short story \"Złote popołudnie\" (\"The Golden Afternoon\") which is postmodern retelling of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland the Queen of Hearts is revealed to be really Queen Mab. In the first episode of season four of HBO's original series \"True Blood\", Queen Mab (portrayed by Rebecca Wisocky) is the Queen of Faerie who centuries ago ordered the fae to retreat to the Plane of Faerie in the wake of vampire aggression. Under her orders, humans with fae blood (including Sookie Stackhouse) are being drawn into Faerie as well. When Sookie rebels against her and escapes back to the mortal realm, Queen Mab seals the Faerie portals for good, trapping the half-fae with her and a handful of true fae in Bon Temps. Although not connected with him in the original source material, Queen Mab has been featured in media series featuring Merlin. She is portrayed by Miranda Richardson in the 1998 TV miniseries \"Merlin\", serving as prominent antagonist to the title character; she is the dark twin to the Lady of the Lake. In an episode of \"\" from the same year, she is an evil enchantress who has corrupted Arthur; Merlin sends the pair back in time to learn a lesson in humility from Hercules. The 2008 TV series \"Merlin\" features Queen Mab as a character in an episode of the show's fifth season, which portrays her as a diminutive green fairy. The composer Hector Berlioz wrote a spectacular “Queen Mab” scherzo in his Romeo et Juliette symphony (1839). Hugh Macdonald describes this piece as \"Berlioz's supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, prestissimo and pianissimo almost without pause... The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.\" The song by the British rock band Queen \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\", based on a painting by Richard Dadd and included in the album Queen II, mentions Queen Mab and many other characters such as Oberon and Titania. Songwriter Becca Stevens set the first half of the text to music on her 2017 album \"Regina\". Queen Mab is the name of a fae (a faerie) painted by American artist Amy Brown in 1999. Queen Mab is a Fall faerie, in a flowing brown and black dress with a centerpiece of roses on a white background. In her right hand she holds a tree branch staff adorned with pearls, in her left hand, a \"magic glowing orb\" - Amy Brown; which she further says in a letter to me: \"I was always painting fae holding magic orbs back then\"."]}
{"query": "Electronic Monitoring Tag technology and types instead of home detention curfew application", "pos": ["House arrest\nHouse arrest In justice and law, house arrest (also called home confinement, home detention, or, in modern times, electronic monitoring) is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to their residence. Only those with a house are allowed to be sentenced to arrest in their residence. Travel is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a prison while pre-trial or sentenced. While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by authoritarian governments against political dissidents. In that case, typically, the person under house arrest does not have access to any means of communication. If electronic communication is allowed, conversations will most likely be monitored. With some electronic monitoring units, the conversations of prisoners can be directly monitored via the unit itself. Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. Galileo was confined to his home following his infamous trial in 1633. Political authorities have often confined leaders to house arrest who were deposed in a coup d'état, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals. This method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities. Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an electronic bracelet was in 1983. Home detention is an alternative to imprisonment; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States. It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending. The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the probation officer or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments. Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender. The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A curfew may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. \"Home confinement\" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is \"home incarceration\", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments. In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without trial or legal representation, and subject to restrictions on their associates. In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's human right to a fair trial. In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent. In some countries, house arrest is often enforced through the use of technology products or services. One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an ankle monitor, also referred to as a tether). The electronic sensor transmits a GPS signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service. If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal. The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts. The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment. Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern. Electronic monitoring is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.    The People's Republic of China continues to use soft detention, a traditional form of house arrest used by the Chinese Empire.    In Italy, house arrest (in Italian \"arresti domiciliari\") is a common practice of detaining suspects, as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is \"de facto\" considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of escape within the previous five years. Notable cases: At sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer. Electronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the New Zealand Department of Corrections to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance."], "neg": ["E-TAG\nE-TAG e-TAG is a free-flow tolling electronic toll collection system used on all tollways throughout Australia. It was originally developed by Transurban for use on their CityLink tollway in the late 1990s, with the system since adopted by all toll roads, bridges and tunnels in Australia. The technology has different names depending on the issuer - such as Breeze (Eastlink Melbourne), Linkt (Queensland), E-toll (Roads & Traffic Authority (NSW) and E-way (Sydney motorways M5 and M1), however these are all interchangeable across Australia and no surcharges apply for use on other operators' toll roads. Toll roads in Australia use free-flow tolling, with no toll booths along the entire length of the system to impede traffic flow. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to have complete, surcharge-free interoperability between rival tolling providers across different state roadway systems. In July 2007, both e-TAG and e-pass video tolling arrangements were introduced in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Westlink M7, Cross City Tunnel and the Lane Cove Tunnel. This measure substantially eased traffic jams heading towards electronic gantries, providing increased convenience and time savings. In early 2009, the Sydney Harbour Bridge became toll-booth free, requiring e-TAGs to be used. There are over 850,000 e-TAG account customers, and over 1 million e-TAGs have been issued. The e-TAG electronic tolling is based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) transponders using the DSRC protocol. The system uses electronic transponders (called e-TAGs) mounted on the inside of the vehicles' windscreen. Gantries constructed over each carriageway record registration plates and detect the e-TAGs. As the vehicle continues along the toll road, additional gantries monitor the distance travelled. Associated software then determines the toll amount payable, which is automatically deducted from the prepaid account associated with the tag. Where a tag is not detected, the vehicle's registration is recorded using video tolling technology which incorporates an automatic number plate recognition system and checked against a government motor registration database.  For infrequent use of the system a user can buy a Daypass – by phone, online, at any Australia Post outlet or at participating service stations. A Daypass can be bought in advance or afterwards (until midnight three days later).  If payment has not been made after three days, the vehicle's registered owner will be sent a late toll invoice in the mail, and if the late toll invoice is then not paid a fine will be issued. In Victoria the fine will be issued by Civic Compliance Victoria. The life of the battery in an e-TAGs is approximately 5 years. Customers are advised when a device is about to expire and to contact the issuer should their e-TAG not beep as they pass a tolling gantry, to receive a replacement device."]}

Raised by his grandmother, Mary Bratton, in New Castle, Delaware, near Wilmington, John Walter Bratton (sometimes spelled Bratten) was the son of John F. and Emma Bratton, of whom little is known. He was educated at the Harkness Academy in Wilmington and later attended the Philadelphia College of Music before embarking on a career as a baritone singer. John Bratton's career soon moved from performer to composer and producer. He began in the chorus of a show called \"Ship Ahoy\" for $18 a week and not before too long was selling songs written with his friend, lyricists Walter H. Ford, for as little as $10 a title. Over the years Bratton would collaborate on over 250 songs with Ford and Paul West. One of their earlier tunes was a tribute to veterans of the Spanish–American War called \"Hats off to the Boys Who Made Good\", that years later Bratton conceded was \"terrible\". Today he is remembered for his composition Op103, dating from 1907, \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\", the only one of his songs to be a lasting hit. Although most of his compositions had lyrics, he left \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\" as an instrumental. Perhaps because it sold so well as sheet music he felt little need to do anything else with it; during the silent film era it was used as background music for a number of popular movies. Many years later British-based, but Irish-born Jimmy Kennedy wrote the lyrics. This explains why an American composition contains the British term \"Mummies and Daddies\" rather than \"Mommies and Daddies\", though the latter does crop up from time to time in copies printed in the former colony. Tunes Bratton wrote that were popular in their day include \"The Sunshine of Paradise Alley\" (ca. 1895), \"Henrietta, Have You Met Her?\" (ca. 1895), \"I Love You in the Same Old Way\" (ca. 1896), \"Isabella\" and \"In a Cosey Corner\" ( ca. 1901). As half of the firm Lefler and Bratton he produced the musical comedies \"Hodge Podge and Co.\" (1900), \"The Star and the Garter\" (1900), \"The Man from China\" (1904), \"The Pearl and the Pumpkin\" (1905) and others. Bratton married popular Broadway actress Dorothy Zimmerman (1883–1957) on May 21, 1907. Their marriage produced a daughter. John Walter Bratton died at his Brooklyn home in February 1947, aged 80. He had just completed the song \"Time Brings Many Changes\" with his partner Leo Edwards, brother of songwriter Gus Edwards. Bratton was survived by his wife Dorothy Bratton (née Zimmerman) and daughter. His songs were featured in many other musical comedies including \"The Rainmakers\" (1894), \"Star & Garter\" (1900), \"The Office Boy\" (1903), \"The Toreador\" (1904), \"The Rollicking Girl\" (1905), and \"The Merry-Go-Round\" (1908)."], "neg": ["John F.

{"query": "Robert Brown other botanical works instead of Dampiera purpurea description", "pos": ["Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)\nRobert Brown (botanist, born 1773) Robert Brown FRSE FRS FLS MWS (21 December 1773 – 10 June 1858) was a Scottish botanist and palaeobotanist who made important contributions to botany largely through his pioneering use of the microscope. His contributions include one of the earliest detailed descriptions of the cell nucleus and cytoplasmic streaming; the observation of Brownian motion; early work on plant pollination and fertilisation, including being the first to recognise the fundamental difference between gymnosperms and angiosperms; and some of the earliest studies in palynology. He also made numerous contributions to plant taxonomy, including the erection of a number of plant families that are still accepted today; and numerous Australian plant genera and species, the fruit of his exploration of that continent with Matthew Flinders. Brown was born in Montrose on 21 December 1773. He was the son of James Brown, a minister in the Scottish Episcopal Church with Jacobite convictions so strong that in 1788 he defied his church's decision to give allegiance to George III. His mother was Helen Brown \"née\" Taylor, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. As a child Brown attended the local Grammar School (now called Montrose Academy), then Marischal College at Aberdeen, but withdrew in his fourth year when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1790. His father died late the following year. Brown enrolled to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but developed an interest in botany, and ended up spending more of his time on the latter than the former. He attended the lectures of John Walker; made botanical expeditions into the Scottish Highlands, alone or with nurserymen such as George Don; and wrote out meticulous botanical descriptions of the plants he collected. He also began corresponding with and collecting for William Withering, one of the foremost British botanists of his day. Highlights for Brown during this period include his discovery of a new species of grass, \"Alopecurus alpinus\"; and his first botanical paper, \"\", read to the Edinburgh Natural History Society in January 1792, but not published in print in Brown's lifetime. Brown dropped out of his medical course in 1793. Late in 1794, he enlisted in the Fifeshire Fencibles, and his regiment was posted to Ireland shortly after. In June 1795 he was appointed Surgeon's Mate. His regiment saw very little action, however, he had a good deal of leisure time, almost all of which he spent on botany. He was frustrated by his itinerant lifestyle, which prevented him from building his personal library and specimen collection as he would have liked, and cut him off from the most important herbaria and libraries. During this period Brown was especially interested in cryptogams, and these would be the subject of Brown's first, albeit unattributed, publication. Brown began a correspondence with James Dickson, and by 1796 was sending him specimens and descriptions of mosses. Dickson incorporated Brown's descriptions into his \"Fasciculi plantarum cryptogamicarum britanniae\", with Brown's permission but without any attribution. By 1800, Brown was firmly established amongst Irish botanists, and was corresponding with a number of British and foreign botanists, including Withering, Dickson, James Edward Smith and José Correia da Serra. He had been nominated to the Linnean Society of London; had contributed to Dickson's \"Fasciculi\"; was acknowledged in a number of other works; and had had a species of algae, \"Conferva brownii\" (now \"Aegagropila linnaei\") named after him by Lewis Weston Dillwyn. He had also begun experimenting with microscopy. However, as an army surgeon stationed in Ireland there seemed little prospect of him attracting the notice of those who could offer him a career in botany. In 1798, Brown heard that Mungo Park had withdrawn from a proposed expedition into the interior of New Holland (now Australia), leaving a vacancy for a naturalist. At Brown's request, Correia wrote to Sir Joseph Banks, suggesting Brown as a suitable replacement: He was not selected, and the expedition did not end up going ahead as originally proposed, though George Caley was sent to New South Wales as a botanical collector for Banks. In 1800, however, Matthew Flinders put to Banks a proposal for an expedition that would answer the question whether New Holland was one island or several. Banks approved Flinders' proposal, and in December 1800 wrote to Brown offering him the position of naturalist to the expedition. Brown accepted immediately. Brown was told to expect to sail at the end of 1800, only a few weeks after being offered the position. A succession of delays meant the voyage did not get under way until July 1801. Brown spent much of the meantime preparing for the voyage by studying Banks' Australian plant specimens and copying out notes and descriptions for use on the voyage. Though Brown's brief was collect scientific specimens of all sorts, he was told to give priority to plants, insects, and birds, and to treat other fields, such as geology, as secondary pursuits. In addition to Brown, the scientific staff comprised the renowned botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer; the gardener Peter Good, whose task was to collect live plants and viable seed for the use of Kew Gardens; the miner John Allen, appointed as mineralogist; the landscape artist William Westall; and the astronomer John Crosley, who would fall ill on the voyage out and leave the ship at the Cape of Good Hope, being belatedly replaced at Sydney by James Inman. Brown was given authority over Bauer and Good, both of whom were instructed to give any specimens they might collect to Brown, rather than forming separate collections. Both men would provide enthusiastic and hard-working companions for Brown, and thus Brown's specimen collections contain material collected by all three men. \"Investigator\" sailed from London on 18 July. They made brief landfalls at Bugio Island (Desertas Islands) and Madeira, but Brown was disappointed to collect almost nothing of note from either site. They arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 October, staying a little over two weeks, during which time Brown made extensive botanical expeditions, and climbed Table Mountain at least twice. Many years later he would write to William Henry Harvey, who was considering emigrating there, that \"some of the pleasantest botanizing he ever had was on Devil's Mountain, near Cape Town, and he thought I could not pitch on a more delightful field of study.\" Amongst the plants collected at the Cape were two new species of \"Serruria\" (Proteaceae), \"S. foeniculacea\" and \"S. flagellaris\".  arrived in King George Sound in what is now Western Australia in December 1801. For three and a half years Brown did intensive botanic research in Australia, collecting about 3400 species, of which about 2000 were previously unknown. A large part of this collection was lost when was wrecked \"en route\" to England. Brown remained in Australia until May 1805. He then returned to Britain where he spent the next five years working on the material he had gathered. He published numerous species descriptions; in Western Australia alone he is the author of nearly 1200 species. The list of major Australian genera that he named includes: Livistona, Triodia, Eriachne, Caladenia, Isolepis, Prasophyllum, Pterostylis, Patersonia, Conostylis, Thysanotus, Pityrodia, Hemigenia, Lechenaultia, Eremophila, Logania, Dryandra, Isopogon, Grevillea, Petrophile, Telopea, Leptomeria, Jacksonia, Leucopogon, Stenopetalum, Ptilotus, Sclerolaena and Rhagodia. In early 1809 he read his paper called \"On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae\" to the Linnean Society of London. This was subsequently published in March 1810 as \"On the Proteaceae of Jussieu\". It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics. This work was extensively plagiarised by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who had memorised much of the Linnean reading and then inserted it in Joseph Knight's 1809 publication \"On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae\". In 1810, he published the results of his collecting in his famous \"Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen\", the first systematic account of the Australian flora. That year, he succeeded Jonas C. Dryander as Sir Joseph Banks' librarian, and on Banks' death in 1820 Brown inherited his library and herbarium. This was transferred to the British Museum in 1827, and Brown was appointed Keeper of the Banksian Botanical Collection. In 1818 he published \"Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, in the vicinity of the Congo\". In 1822, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1827 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, three years later he became associated member. When the institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 Brown joined as foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. In a paper read to the Linnean society in 1831 and published in 1833, Brown named the cell nucleus. The nucleus had been observed before, perhaps as early as 1682 by the Dutch microscopist Leeuwenhoek, and Franz Bauer had noted and drawn it as a regular feature of plant cells in 1802, but it was Brown who gave it the name it bears to this day (while giving credit to Bauer's drawings). Neither Bauer nor Brown thought the nucleus to be universal, and Brown thought it to be primarily confined to Monocotyledons. After the division of the Natural History Department of the British Museum into three sections in 1837, Robert Brown became the first Keeper of the Botanical Department, remaining so until his death. He was succeeded by John Joseph Bennett. He served as President of the Linnean Society from 1849 to 1853. Brown died at 17 Dean Street, Soho Square in London, on 10 June 1858. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Brown's name is commemorated in the Australia herb genus \"Brunonia\" as well as numerous Australian species such as \"Eucalyptus brownii\", \"Banksia brownii\" and the moss Brown's Tetrodontium Moss (\"Tetrodontium brownianum\"), a species which he discovered growing at Roslin near Edinburgh whilst still a student. The plant can still be found at the site of its discovery.  Passing through the suburb of Kingston, south of Hobart, Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen's Land, is Brown's River, named in his honor, upon the banks of which, he collected botanical samples. In South Australia, Mount Brown and Point Brown (near Smoky Bay) were named for him by Flinders during the \"Investigator\" expedition. Mount Brown in British Columbia, Canada is named for him. In 1938 the London County Council commemorated Brown, as well as botanists Joseph Banks and David Don, and meetings of the Linnean Society, with a rectangular stone plaque at 32 Soho Square. In 1827, while examining grains of pollen of the plant \"Clarkia pulchella\" suspended in water under a microscope, Brown observed minute particles, now known to be amyloplasts (starch organelles) and spherosomes (lipid organelles), ejected from the pollen grains, executing a continuous jittery motion. He then observed the same motion in particles of inorganic matter, enabling him to rule out the hypothesis that the effect was life-related. Although Brown did not provide a theory to explain the motion, and Jan Ingenhousz already had reported a similar effect using charcoal particles, in German and French publications of 1784 and 1785, the phenomenon is now known as Brownian motion. In recent years controversy arose over whether Brown's microscopes were insufficient to reveal phenomena of this order. Brown's re-discoveries were denied in a brief paper in 1991. Shortly thereafter, in an illustrated presentation, British microscopist Brian J. Ford presented to Inter Micro 1991 in Chicago a reprise of the demonstration using Brown's original microscope. His video sequences substantiated Brown's observations, suggesting Brown's microscope was sufficient to allow him to see motion. Physicist Phil Pearle and colleagues presented a detailed discussion of Brown's original observations of particles from pollen of \"Clarkia pulchella\" undergoing Brownian motion, including the relevant history, botany, microscopy, and physics. For a list of Brown's publications, see .", "Carex brunnea\nCarex brunnea Carex brunnea, the greater brown sedge, is a small species of plant found in many parts of Asia, as well as eastern Australia and Lord Howe Island. This plant is often seen in disturbed, sunny areas in and near rainforest.

Brown recorded the type \"(J.) v.v.\" Brown's name of \"Carex gracilis\" was ruled invalid, as the plant had previously appeared in scientific literature in 1784.

Although nominally written by Joseph Knight as a paper on cultivation techniques, all but 13 pages consists of an unattributed taxonomic revision now known to have been written by Richard Salisbury. Publication of the paper triggered one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany, because Salisbury had preempted the publication of numerous plant names that Robert Brown had intended to publish. Brown's paper had already been read to the Linnean Society of London, at meeting which Salisbury had attended, but his paper had not yet made it to print. In publishing this paper before Brown's \"On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae\" had been printed, Salisbury beat Brown to print, claiming priority for the names that Brown had authored. As a result of this, Salisbury was accused of plagiarism and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letters indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, Samuel Goodenough wrote \"How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!\"; and James Edward Smith wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper \"but shall not keep it — I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions.\" Brown himself wrote of Salisbury \"I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool.\" Initially, Salisbury's names were ignored in favour of Brown's names. When the conservation of generic names was introduced in the 1900s, Brown's genera were formally conserved. However it was not possible to conserve species names until the 1980s, by which time the priority of Salisbury's species names had long been accepted. Thus \"On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae\" is the source of numerous names of Proteaceae taxa."], "neg": ["Peter Brown (naturalist)\nPeter Brown (naturalist) Peter Brown (active 1758-1799) was an English naturalist and natural history illustrator of Danish family who worked mainly in London.

He was the president of University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas from 1960 to 1974, the second longest serving president. Mullins was born August 11, 1906, in Ash Flat, Arkansas, to Roscoe C. and Emma Matilda Mullins. He attended University of Arkansas, graduating cum laude in 1931. In 1934, he earned a master's degree from the University of Colorado. He received his doctoral degree from Columbia University in 1941. Began his teaching career during the Great Depression as a high school teacher in the small rural town of Lepanto, Arkansas, where he also as the superintendent of schools. He later became the chair of the department of educational administration for Alabama Polytechnic Institute, which would later become Auburn University. However, he served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy during World War II.  After the war, Mullins returned to Alabama Polytechnic Institute as a vice president, serving from 1949 to 1960. However, his alma mater would soon need a new president. In 1959, John Tyler Caldwell left the Arkansas to become chancellor of North Carolina State University. The university search committee named Storm Whaley as acting president. In 1960, Mullins was named the president.  During his presidency, the campus had tremendous growth. The student enrollment more than doubled, which lead to a massive construction phase. The university built new a student union, library, and communications building along with new residence halls. Among the new residence halls were Yocum, Humphreys, Fulbright, Hotz and Carlson Terrace. Much of the building was funded by private gifts to the university. However, similar to most college campuses during the 1960s, Mullins also presided over the tumultuous period that included the Vietnam War protests. Additionally, Mullins helped create the University of Arkansas System, brokering a series of mergers. First came Little Rock University in 1969, which became University of Arkansas at Little Rock, along with Arkansas A&M in 1971, which would be renamed University of Arkansas at Monticello, and Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal (AM&N), eventually renamed the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff in 1972. In August 1935, he married Eula Elizabeth Harrell. They had three children, Carolyn, David Jr., and Gary. His son, David W.

Former United States President and University of Arkansas faculty member Bill Clinton, Chancellor John White, poet Miller Williams, Fulbright College Dean Donald Bobbitt, and Harriet Fulbright, widow of the late senator all spoke at the dedication ceremony. The Fulbright Peace Fountain is located between Vol Walker Hall and Old Main. It was completed in 1998, and dedicated on October 24, 1998. It was constructed in honor of J. William Fulbright, and his belief that \"education, particularly study abroad, has the power to promote tolerance and understanding among nations.\" Originally the fountain had water coming up through the middle. Spoofer's Stone, according to legend, was to be used for construction of the oldest building on campus, Old Main, which was under construction from 1873 to 1875. Limestone was used for the lintels over windows, among other places. One of the large pieces of limestone being hauled by oxcart to the building site of Old Main slipped off the cart, landing on the ground in front of the building site, and it was left there after cleanup. During the 1880s, the university's authorities forbade the male and female students from being together at most times, requiring them to sit on opposite sides of a classroom, line up on opposite sides of the hallways and avoid each other in social situations. The Spoofer's Stone became a location for lovers to leave notes for one another. Later it became a popular location for men to propose marriage to women. The stone's ragged appearance is due to the tradition of breaking off a piece of the stone after a proposal, a practice which has been forbidden. The origin of the name \"Spoofer\" or who Spoofer was, is unknown.

The mealybug is a subterranean species and sucks sap from the rootlets of certain trees, particularly species of \"Ficus\" and the coconut palm. It exudes drops of honeydew which form part of the diet of the ant. Worker ants tend the mealybugs and stimulate the production of honeydew by stroking their abdomens. If the ant colony is disturbed and the ants are forced to disperse, each takes a female mealybug to the new nest site, carrying it in her mandibles. When the soil is warm and damp, the ants and mealybugs remain just below the surface, but during cold, dry weather they descend to greater depths. This mutualistic arrangement seems to occur throughout the range of the ant. \"X. annandalei\" has not been found anywhere except in association with \"A. acutiventris\" in its nest, and while being transported by the queen who carries a female mealybug on her nuptial flight. The colony she founds is thus provided with the food supply it needs to prosper. No other means of dispersal is known for this mealybug."], "neg": ["Exhyalanthrax afer\nExhyalanthrax afer Exhyalanthrax afer, is a member of the fly family Bombyliidae.
